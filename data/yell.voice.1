Further information about ISCABBS account validation:

When you enter your five-digit validation key, you begin the validation
process.  Your account information must still be validated manually by a
Sysop.  Since hundreds of new accounts are created on ISCABBS every day,
the validation procedure may take several days to complete.  Please be
patient.

Step I: The validation key
==========================

The first step in validation is entering your validation key.
A validation key was created when you created your account, and it was
sent to the email address you listed at the time of account creation.

If it has been more than 48 hours since you created your account, and
you have not received your key, then there may be a problem with your
email address.  In that case:

-- Please check with the computing center or support where you are to
find out what your email address is, and how to list it correctly.

-- Add it to your account information by typing:  <c>onfig, then <a>ddress
and entering the correct data at the appropriate prompt.

-- Send yourself a new validation key by typing <c>onfig, <k>ey, <c>reate.
The key will be sent to your email address; if you need help accessing
your email messages, seek assistance from your local system administrators.

-- Enter your new validation key, either at the prompt when you login, or
by typing:  <c>onfig, <k>ey, <e>nter.

Step II:  The validation queue
===============================

Once you've entered the key, your account info joins a long line
(the validation-queue) of other account infos which are waiting to be
examined by the Sysops -- in order of receipt.  If the Sysops find
a problem with your account info, you will receive a message at login
and experience a five-minute wait.

If you've experienced such a wait, please make any needed changes by
typing:  <c>onfig, <a>ddress, and entering the data at the appropriate
prompt. Then <y>ell to let the Sysops know that changes have been made.
If you've  experienced such a wait, and you're not sure what's wrong with
your registration info, please <y>ell and ask.

If you haven't received a message at login, but you're still marked as a
new user, *please don't <y>ell*.  Account info is reviewed in order of
receipt, so <y>elling will not help you be validated any faster.

Exception:  if it has been *more than seven days* since you entered your
validation key (*not* since you created your account), and you're not
receiving a message or a wait at login, but you're still marked as a new
user, please <y>ell.  There may be another problem with your account.  In
your <y>ell, let us know that you've been in the validation queue for more
than seven days.
