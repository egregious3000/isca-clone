Might it behoove ISCA to have the FIs for these fora updated?
So that they do not specify non-existant forum names and otherwise potentially
contradict themselves (as apparently the CBG FI does, as it specifies NON-CCGs,
and then later on says they're ok).

Just a thought.

Is ISCA privately owned now?  It used to be under the domain of the University

private individual, who is not liable for some 16 yr old kid lying and yelling

Didn't used to be that way.  I'm sure that's why you used to have to send

covers matters in a legal sense.  I still haven't found anything on Kama that

When ISCA was a big deal, people were more able to imagine it might be a
target.  Now ISCA is one of (according to extremely scientific research
I just pulled out of a convenient orifice) approximately 8 billion
online communities, and it's one of the less convenient to get to
because it uses an antiquated protocol that virtually nobody else uses
for any purpose (even telnet's original purpose of communication between
unix machines has been replaced by ssh).

A large fraction of those 8 billion online communities allow talk about
sex.  Few if any of them require any verification of age beyond "Hey,
say you're 18!"

It's just laughable that anybody would care what happens on ISCA
anymore.

It's like worrying about crimes committed over telegraph.

Less convenient to get to?  I find it more convenient since no graphics are
involved, and the text-only medium comes quickly to dirt-slow antiquated
machines the library system offers.  Although telnet is blocked on some
computers and even the DOS shell is blocked on a few.

I saw a mention in one forum of "ISCA powers-that-be"  and it did cause me to
chuckle.  There's anybody associated with ISCA that considers themselves a
power-that-be?  Power over what?  :)   I've never seen ISCA openly ask for
"sysops" before.  Sysop pluralized.  Like "we'll take anybody, just ask."
Powers-that-be must be jumping ship.  :)  I'd go for it myself if I had steady
online access.

It's still a great place for lots of different feedback on various issues, esp.
techie type things, so don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking the site at all.  I
just found the powers-that-be statement humorous.

Most people don't use the computers in the library to access adult material.
In fact, most people don't use the computers in the library to access the
internet at all.

ISCABBS requires a registration process that many people find cumbersome and
slow, whereas the sort of online communities that Faunus is talking about can
be accessed with a single click of the mouse.

"I saw a mention in one forum of "ISCA powers-that-be"  and it did cause me to
chuckle.  There's anybody associated with ISCA that considers themselves a
power-that-be?"

They're generally talking about the Sysops, the NPO and/or the policy board.
They're not talking about real power, just those who keep the BBS running.

"I've never seen ISCA openly ask for
"sysops" before.  Sysop pluralized.  Like "we'll take anybody, just ask."
Powers-that-be must be jumping ship."

ISCA generally publically asks for Sysop applications publically.
However, there is no "we'll take anybody, just ask" process, now or in the
past.

based that upon constant queries to the bbs.  That process was incredibly
buggy and would eat up resources and make the website unusable.

At some point, IO ERROR apparently decided to cut ties altogether, tried to
crash the server (which was also my home server at the time) and never logged
in again, and I don't know if he deleted anything, but I can't find the script
that did the queries to try and fix it.

developed a list on his own, based on people he had profiled. He also happened
to also save a list of user numbers. However, it wasn't a complete list, but a
large list nonetheless.

I have a script like the one that Copper Lethe described.  There's no
functionality of the BBS that lets you do it -- that's one of the reasons
I wrote it.

I dumped all the current users, sorted by profile number, in Non Seq> on
Friday.  (That list was probably a day out-of-date.)  I think God Man Megatron
had his own user stalker (his words, IIRC) back in the day, too.

That's Egregeious' list.

I don't see anything user stalker about it.  Now, maybe, if somebody could go
in and grab the physical addresses of each of those nicks they used when they
signed up initially, there would be something stalkerish about that.

I don't really see a use to having to list a physical address upon acct signup.
 Those could easily be made up.  Unless a sysop gets on google maps and sees if
the address physically exists.  Even then, somebody could just use a physical
address that he/she knows to exist and use it as his/her own.  I seriously
doubt if any user as ever received snail mail from isca.

At one point duplicate accounts were a serious problem for the BBS.  There's
the tale of the person who made a duplicate account with an address they found,
and turned out to be within a few minutes of one of the Sysops.  The brain
surgeon behind this amazing idea also called in a fake death report to the
newspaper to claim that the actual owner of the duplicate account had died.

Ah, fun times, fun times.

I do remember that physical addys were kind of checked by Sysops; obvious fake
addresses could get yourself "not verified" or whatever that "not verified

reason, most BBSs had to have all that data from the users.

Mariah, the intro to this forum has the age verification process in it:

"You may <y>ell your date of birth if you would like to be age validated. By
yelling, you are certifying that you are submitting true and accurate
information.

The Sysops will acknowledge your yell once they have input your DOB. You will
be able to check it by hitting shift<P> and profiling yourself, and you will
be able to <j>ump to Kama Sutra> - you must enter the full room name on the
first occasion."

Your ISCABBS account will time-out (be automatically removed)

1)  Unvalidated users with incomplete registration information
    are deleted immediately.
2)  Unvalidated users with partially incomplete information
    are deleted if their last login was 10 days ago or longer.
3)  Validated Users are deleted if:
    a) the number of logins is less than 10 and the last login
       is more than 30 days ago; or
    b) the number of logins is greater than, or equal to, 10
       and the last login is more than 120 days ago.


It won't do any good to <y>ell asking us not to delete your
account based on the above; the computer does it automatically.

I do agree that if it is going to be this difficult for the sysops to help out

I may just make a backup copy of the client32.ini file and start trying to

I wasn't intending to be overly critical.  Encrypted passwords in .ini files
are just about as annoying as losing the passwords outright.  Because I can't
always depend on having a flash drive with me that has that particular client
on it.  On occassion, I have need to use the java based telnet connection, in
which case I have to know the pw.  Plus, changing the pw every once in awhile
is a good security measure.

Devil Lady, whatever the case, I have been very complimentary of the way you

OK, stupid luser question but I just can't seem to figure this out from the

room, but then when I next log on I still have 150 messages unread.  I want to
clean the slate :)

amazon for $24.95 and that is JUST under their free shipping and I really don't
want to pay that much for it.

If you are at a garage sale and see a copy of it and it's NOT expensive, grab
it and I will pay you for it and shipping.  I would rather not pay more than
$10 for it used.  Thanks so much!

Ruger 10/22 rifle for sale. Gun is in good shape. Comes with scope, 3 mags, and
a hard case. Scope is sighted in at 25 meters.  No firing problems with any of
the mags. Good gun for varmint, or just plinking. Got a 9mm carbine, so no need
for this one any longer.
New 10/22s are around $279 for this style for just the rifle. I am asking $200

to ship to a FFL dealer.

I need to sell some of my stuff so I can afford food.  So here goes this one: I
have a Harman kardon AVR-135 surround sound (5.1 or 6.1 dolby digital
compatible) audio-video receiver in like new condition.  It is 40 watts per
channel up to 6 evenly powered channels.  Just $230.  Iowa city area only or
pre-pay with certified money order, including shipping.  Use your tax refund
wisely - buy this great home stereo amplifier!

I also have an entertainment center, made of pressed oak.  It is unfinished,
shows a little wear just from me moving it (tape adhesive on the glass mostly,
a broken maget holder which could easily be replaced).  The glass itself is not
broken and the wood is not dented up its in good shape.  I'll sell it for $200
even though I think it cost $330-$400 new.  Its in Iowa City, local buyers only
please (nearby areas).  I can transport it if needed.

Lastly, I have a Sony 31-inch LCD TV in excellent condition.  It was purchased
from Best Buy for $2000 but I will sell it for just $650.  It is 1080p (high
resolution great for HDTV, DVDs, etc).  Great for video games or even a
computer since it has a VGA port on the back of it (you can connect your
computer directly to the TV and use the TV as a large LCD monitor!).

Let me know if you want this cool stuff, the Tv fits great in the entertainment
center, so buy both if you want or all 3 and I will throw in a DVD player with
remote control (and maybe a couple of movies and the cables you need).

I am a contractor worker representing HP as in HP-Enterprises.  This is the HP
that provides IT services to other Fortune 500 and 1000 companies.  One of
those clients is the New General Motors.  Obama, you can say, owns it.  Both
the CEO at General Motors and the HP have stepped down.  You can verify this
with the current news.

The good news is General Motors posted a profitable quarter on wall street.  I
have good news for job seekers or better yet anyone who wants a new beginning
in Information Tech to support General Motors.  These jobs were told to me by
HP and a day later by my contracting house.  Since I worked for EDS and HP for
the last 8 years, they have asked to send 6 people their way under a referral
program.  Unfortunately, these jobs are $10/hr with alot of opportunity for
overtime.  The secret is to work smarter and not harder.  I will visit this
site for the next 5 days, if interested in the job description below please
leave mail here with your name and email to get the process started.

-------------------
The opportunity :



Client                      :    HP (Hewlett Packard)
Job Title                  :    2752799 - (Technical Solutions Rep II)
Duration                  :    24 Months + High probability of extension
Location                  :    Pontiac, MI, 48341.

Job Description:

- Shifts are 7 X 24.
- Majority of the shifts will fall Monday b
- Majority of the shifts will fall Monday - Friday, 6 AM to 8 PM (EST).
- Flexibility in shift schedules is a MUST!
- Handle calls according to set policies.
- Utilize all tools available for assisting the customer Understanding user's
issues and taking the correct steps to accurately document and handle per set
processes.
- Call Center experience is a Plus.

Again this is $10/hr.  Any other recruiter will lie and cheat you lower.

One owner, Impulse Red 2006 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab 4WD V6 6spd manual with
TRD Off-Road package, towing package and SR5 Trimlevel. 60,000 miles. $17,500
or serious offer.

See the ad on craigslist at
http://quadcities.craigslist.org/cto/2440677011.html


TRD Off-Road package includes push-button locking rear differential, 4WD,
off-road suspension, and standard skid plates.
Factory towing package can tow up to 6,500 pounds.
SR5 Trim includes leather wrapped steering wheel and shift knob, sport bucket
seats, fog lights, sliding rear window and 400W inverter in the bed.

The truck is perfect for tailgating and camping with the 400watt inverter and
access cab. Bed has two fixed tie-down points at the rear with rails along the
front and sides that take the adjustable/removable tie-down cleats. If you can
fit it in there, you can tie it down. Great for hauling a sport ATV. The 4.0
litre engine and 6 speed manual transmission makes towing your boat, enclosed,
or car trailer a breeze. The 4-wheel drive, locking diff and off-road
suspension will get you where you need to go in any weather but rides almost
like a car on the highway.

There are some minor cosmetic issues but you won't find something better for
less money! Owners have rated the Tacoma 4.7 out of 5 on KBB and this one has
almost every desirable feature. Priced well below blue book of $18,380
(kbb.com, will provide link on request) but I'm taking serious offers. The only
reason I'm selling it is I've moved to the city and can't keep both the car and
the truck. Please contact me if you have any more questions.

I'm looking for your unwanted, working xbox games. Looking for someone who's
willing to part with a lot of games.

original xbox, the old machine, not 360

A good friend of mine has recently become disabled. He's bored out of his mind,
stuck home, no cable tv and only the one game for his old xbox. Did I mention
he's BORED ?

He does happen to be a veteran, so if you need a tax deduction for your
games... I can arrange to run your donation thru his veterans charitable
organization and get you written acknowledgement from them on the donation.
I'll pay shipping if you're willing to dig thru your old stuff to help a
veteran.

These games aren't selling for much price on eBay, (in lots, they're selling
for about a buck each, plus flatrate shipping). If you want to finally get rid
of your games and avoid eBay hassle.... I might be willing to buy and pay
shipping too... depending if you're competitive on your price. Of course, if
I'm buying, you're not donating, so no  acknowledgement from any charity for
you ! Mail> me
Thanks

  Right now, we are basically waiting for the ISCA board to agree that Kena can
pick up where I left off.  They've been deciding this for I don't know how
long, because this is how the ISCA board works:

Excited New Board Member>   "Let's do X!  thoughts"

(3 days later)              "Hello?"

(a week later)              "guys?  X?  thoughts?"

DrMemory>                   "not my area, i don't know"

(a week later)              "Anybody else?"

(2 weeks later)             "FUCK you guys, what the fuck are you doing?"

Random board member>        "Ok by me."

(2 weeks later)             "So do we need to vote, or---?"

(a week later)              "Hello?"

(a week later)              "guys?  Let's start voting."

(2 weeks later)             "HEY!  What the hell?!"

Random baord member>        "Yeah I guess we should"

                            ^^^^^ doesn't actually cast as vote


  This literally goes for months and months and months in some cases.

then another board memeber decided that his only role is to jump up and down

The following is an excerpt from a children's book, "Captain Underpants and
the Perilous Plot of Professor Poopypants", by Dave Pilkey.  The evil
Professor forces everyone to assume new names.

Use the first letter of your first name to determine your NEW first name:
a = stinky
b = lumpy
c = buttercup
d =gidget
e = crusty
f = greasy
g = fluffy
h = cheeseball
i = chim-chim
j = poopsie
k = flunky
l = booger
m = pinky
n = zippy
o = goober
p = doofus
q = slimy
r = loopy
s = snotty
t = falafel
u=dorkey
v = squeezit
w = oprah
x= skipper
y = dinky
z = zsa-zsa

Use the first letter of your last name to determine the first half of your
NEW last name:
a = diaper
b = toilet
c = giggle
d = bubble
e = girdle
f = barf
g = lizard
h = waffle
i = cootie
j = monkey
k = potty
l = liver
m = banana
n = rhino
o = burger
p = hamster
q = toad
r = gizzard
s = pizza
t = gerbil
u = chicken
v = pickle
w = chuckle
x =tofu
y = gorilla
z = stinker

Use the last letter of your last name to determine the second half of your
NEW  last name:
a = head
b = mouth
c = face
d = nose
e = tush
f = breath
g = pants
h = shorts
i = lips
j = honker
k = butt
l = brain
m = tushie
n = chunks
o = hiney
p = biscuits
q = toes
r = buns
s = fanny
t = sniffer
u =sprinkles
v = kisser
w = squirt
x =humperdinck
y = brains
z = juice

Thus, for example, George Bush's new name is Fluffy Toiletshorts ... and Al
Gore would be Stinky Lizardtush, pretty fitting.

number of affirmative votes shall be appointed to that office.

Section 5.04.  Removal.(20)  A director may be removed at any time for cause by

the removal of one or more directors named in the notice.  Only the named
director or directors may be removed at the meeting.

or Secretary. Acceptance of a resignation is not necessary to make it
effective.  A resignation is effective when the notice is effective unless the
notice specifies a later date.  If a resignation is made effective at a later
date, the board may fill the pending vacancy before the effective date if the
board provides that the successor does not take office until the effective
date.

Section 5.06.  Increase in Number.  The number of directors may be increased by
amendment to these bylaws by the affirmative vote of a majority of the entire

delivered personally or sent by mail or e-mail to each director at his or her
address as shown by the records of the Corporation, unless the meeting must be
held within three days.  If mailed, the notice shall be deemed to be delivered

with postage prepaid.  If notice is given by e-mail, it shall be deemed to be

attendance of a director at any meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of
the meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose
of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened.  Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be
specified in the notice or waiver of notice of the meeting, unless specifically
required by these bylaws.

Section 5.10.  Quorum.(25)  A majority of the Board of Directors shall

may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors,
though less than a quorum.  A director so elected shall be elected for the un-
expired term of his or her predecessor in office and until his or her successor
is elected and has qualified.  Any directorship to be filled by reason of an
increase in the number of directors shall be filled by a special election held
immediately after the increase is passed. If a director elected by members
ceases to be a director, the vacancy may be filled by the board in absence of a
contrary provision in the articles or the bylaws.(28)  Where a vacancy occurs
in any office held by an appointed director, only the person who appointed the
director may fill the vacancy in the absence of an article or bylaw provision
to the contrary.(29)

Section 5.13.  Compensation.(30)  Directors as such shall not receive any
stated salaries for their services, but the Board of Directors may by
resolution allow a fixed sum and expenses of attendance, if any, for attendance
at each regular or special meeting of the board.  Nothing in these bylaws
shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any
other capacity and receiving compensation for that service.

of the meeting before the adjournment of the meeting or forwards a dissent by
registered mail to the Secretary of the Corporation promptly after the
adjournment of the meeting.  A director who voted in favor of an action may not
dissent from the action.

Section 5.17.  General Standards for Directors.(33)  A director shall discharge
his or her duties as a director (1) in good faith; (2) in a manner the director
reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. The members
of the board of directors, when becoming informed in connection with their
decision-making functions, shall discharge their duties with the care that a
person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar
circumstances. In discharging such duties, a director may rely on information,
opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other
financial data, if prepared or presented by the following persons if the
director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert
competence: (1) one or more officers of the corporation; (2) legal counsel,
public accountants, or other persons as to matters involving skills or
expertise the director reasonably believes are either of the following: (a)

deemed a trustee with respect to the corporation or any property held or
administered by the corporation, including without limitation, property that
may be subject to restrictions imposed by the donor or transferor of such
property.

proceeding theretofore or thereafter brought or threatened based in whole or in
part upon any such state of facts.

Section 8.04.  Nonexclusive.(54)  The indemnification and advancement of
expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this article shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which a person seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any provision in the articles of

directors, or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and
as to action in another capacity while holding the office, and shall continue

Section 8.07. Validity and Enforceability.  If this article or any portion
hereof shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable on any ground by any court

the maximum extent permitted by any applicable portion of this article that
shall not have been invalidated.

officer, member, employee, agent, partner, trustee (or in a similar capacity)
of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint venture,

shall be primary.  To the extent that indemnity or expenses of a person
entitled to indemnification and payment of expenses pursuant to this article

be deemed to be in satisfaction of the Corporation's obligation to such person
to make indemnification and pay expenses pursuant to this article.

United States Internal Revenue Law).

Rape can be quite an experience for both perpetrator and victim, though it does
get a bit one-sided sometimes.

Are there any tips to make it less traumatic for the victim?

I'm thinking:
1) Make a compliment to the victim during the rape. Something like 'nice tits'
should take the edge off a bit.
2) Wear a decent aftershafe to make the victim feel a bit more special.
3) Rape one of her friends too, so the victim has someone to talk with about
it.

I'm so glad not to be working in plant operations now.  I feel bad for my
replacement, though; he liked working in ops until my department got added onto
his.  It's still the same song and dance where the corporate types bring in
labor-intensive, low-value work and then criticize us (or now, him) for not
hitting the revenue targets that assume a more balanced or even a really
lucrative product mix.
The target is $400k a day in throughput.  The other day, my replacement could
only identify about $250k in fresh work (inventory usually is 10-25% rework,
which we only get credit for the first time it passes through our hands, but it
still counts against us for inventory, so we have to explain the discrepancy
with their expectations every day--which should tell you something).  Sometimes
some high-dollar jobs come in later, but they're just not always there or close
enough to count on showing up by 7:30 in the morning when the first report has
to go out to management.
"No," my replacement's boss said, "You're going to report that you're hitting
$400k, and you're going to hit $400k."
Oh, okay.  Obviously you know something we don't about how to run a plant
you've been working in for less than a month.  Clearly your experience
elsewhere has shown you how to more efficiently plan based on looking at two
days from our logbook last weekend, without having to compare to weekday
production, or anything else.  Please enlighten us.

In Googling around, all this TIOC functions are Linux specific and defined in
/usr/include/bits/ioctl-types.h and are pulled in by including <sys/ioctl.h>.
Is there any hope of getting this to build on FreeBSD?

Note: The errors are the same using make or gmake.

downloaded version 2.3.8 (last version on the website in dmg.bin format) and
ran it and according to the instructions all I need to do is stype bbs at the
command prompt in Terminal but when I do so it gives the error 'command not
found'.  Is there some missing steps to set the client up?

/usr/bin is OS space, so it's probably not best to put it there anyway.

The easiest thing is probably to just put it in the root of your home
directory.  Try this:

Open a new terminal window or tab.
cp Downloads/mac_os_10.6-2.3.8.dmg.bin ./bbs
chmod +x bbs
../bbs

  Probably a more recent post in the history.

Nope, you can't adjust it. R&D was abandoned by its authors before x's longer

Okay, what's there technically works, in the sense that it does something; it
shows how many unread messages you have in each forum if you log in.

If you log in as guest (which is the default) it just lists all forums.

It doesn't have icons yet, so that might make your compiler barf, since
I didn't want to upload the default android one.  I'm still not sure what
to use as an icon.  Maybe some raccoon.

Alright.  What's there now is usable for beta testing.  I haven't
uploaded an .apk file yet; if you want to try this you can build from
the source.

Use the "Back" button instead of the one built into your phone.

You can't see posts you've already read, or interact with forums that don't
already have unread messages.

The messages you read with the client are not marked as read on the BBS.

I implemented the "see forum list," "see message list," and "read post"
concepts all into one activity.  This is not The Android Way but it
makes the switching pretty fast.

So what's the proper way to show the user the list of messages?

There's only so much screen width on a phone.  Would (Username) [Start of
message] be efficient?

I've run into some issues with the scrollview either sticking when it
shouldn't or not doing so when it should.

ANd how do you show an 80-column wide post on a phone?  I'm doing the
most naive implementation now: just show the lines, so they wrap in a
jagged way.  Let the user toggle modes for paragraph text?

  Download ConnectBot. You can telnet to ISCA with that (or your shell
  account and use a client). That will give you an idea of how to display
  80 col width (I think its 90x30? on my HTC Vivid). I guess the font is
  just small!?

  As for UI...list of messages...make it look like .. email? I'm not
  following you.
  Are you making a "cli" type interface or a different kind of GUI?

  I've seen scrollview act goofy as well. I also hate how when you're at
  the end, and you try to scroll, nothing happens. Ironically, I think
  that is because Apple patented the bounce end scroll thingy...

Egregious> Modern smartphones are plenty high res enough to do a standard 80x25
display. As long as you do 80 column, ISCA will display fine. That's its
default. The vertical length requires a min of 25 for proper spacing, but can
be as "tall" as your scrollback buffer supports.

As TAP said, look to ConnectBot (it's GPL) for a visual example. On my Galaxy S
(the original, not the 2 or 3) it defaults to 80x34 when in vertical mode with
the virtual keyboard on screen.On another Galaxy S (with a physical keyboard)
it defaults to 80x20 in horizontal mode with no virtual keyboard.

The Galaxy S screen is 480 (width) x 800 (height). You have to remember that
VGA was 640x480, so if a VGA console could display a full 80x25 terminal, a
current smartphone isn't going to have an issue.

Honestly, your biggest problem will be adjusting for the higher resolution
screens. On my HTC Amaze 4G (HTC Ruby) I have the same issue as TAP with
ConnectBot. It recognizes the higher resolution display and as a result,
defaults to a width of 90 characters.

That makes the text really small and you end up with wasted display space.

Have your client always default to an 80 column display, regardless of absolute
resolution.

Typically it happens becaue the router is timing out your connection. Only
solution is to try to adjust the settings in your router's firmware (if it's
available) or replace your router's firmware with one that can adjust (if your

  Do you telnet to other locations?

  Roady's client has no 'keep alive' so if you're idle for 5+ min, the router
  will drop the telnet connection to save resources.
  You need to config something to not drop idle connections after 5 min.

There is an APK if you don't want to compile from source.  It's in the
bin directory of the project, bin/racc-client.apk.

You will still need the SDK with the platform-tools, specifically adb.
You can install that APK -- either in an Android emulator or an
Android phone -- with "adb install racc-client.apk".

The emulator will run on any recent laptop or desktop (Mac, Linux, Windows)
although it might take several minutes to start up.  To install on an
Android phone you will need to authorize installation from "unknown
sources" in your phone's settings.



I can look into dropping it into the Amazon app store (since I don't
need to pay upfront for that one) if people just want a one-click
install to a physical phone.  But it's still not fully ready for
prime-time -- behind the scenes it is making blocking network calls in
response to UI events.  This means if the raccdoc interface fails to
respond the UI will hang.  (The raccdoc interface has always been very
quick, but the Right Way is to make this all asynchronous and cache
results in a DB, which will probably double the size of the code
base.)

  I was able to use the client on Android 4.0.4 (I think I used it before I
  was down graded to 4.0.3).
  It had my user info saved from the previous install.
  I was able to get on and browse my known forums.
  I have to say the method of getting around is .. odd.
  Maybe I'm biased, but RSS readers "Newsify" on the iPhone have things
  down pretty well.

  Suggestion:

  Known (20)
  Unknown (70)

  (Clicking one makes the screen 'slide' to the next)

  Client (5/150) (5 unread/150 total?)
  Video Games and Pinball (5/150) (I guess 150 is redundant at this point)
  Programming (10)
  INet (4)
  WWW (10)

  Clicking one makes the screen 'slide' to the next

  Clicking one makes the screen slide to the next

  Here's where you display the post.
  I love the "navigation" where you can slide your finger from left to right
  to go to the next "post" and right to left go to the previous. You can tap
  to bring up the menu (option allows to hide the menu to use all the screen
  for text, though on android, you have a dedicated back button on the device).

  I know you've just started.

  Seems i'm not getting the 80 chars, even though my HTC Vivid is pretty big..
  decent resolution...in portrait. closer in landscape, but still seems
  short.

  No crashes.

  Patch didn't work:

  I wouldn't expect anything else to work after that point.

Thanks for the reports.

Cyanide: the "Done" button is hidden below.  I'll see about adding a
scroll bar.

TAP: Oh, left-to-right scrolling for 'previous' / 'next' sounds good.
I've iteratively designed it with myself as the primary user, so it's
optimized for me and I know what it's doing.

The latest version in source has a 'next' button which should function
a lot like hitting the space bar from the text interface, always taking
you to the next message / forum.  I'll try to update the APK to have
that tonight.

One problem is that "back" has two meanings.  In Android world, it's
supposed to take you to your previous task, like "back" on a browser.
On the BBS, "back" means to read backwards.  I use the prior term and
that might be confusing.  Maybe
I should say "up" instead.

I agree it needs UX work.

i would be ok with an expand collapse thing for posts rather then a whole

it might be a lot harder though

My computer expert friend myke got the client to run on FreeBSD 8.3 ... here's
what he had to say about it on irc:

22:57 <Capa> ja
22:57 <myke> phluffy# gmake install

22:58 <myke> try bbs on phluffy now
23:04 <Capa> swate, works thanks man u rok
23:05 <Capa> the only thing extra a user haz to do is edit ~/.bbsrc and change
             the "site" line to bbs.iscabbs.com (no port#)
23:05 <Capa> that was teh case with the old client also
23:06 <Capa> can you haz send me the patch work you did, or whatever? I'll post
             it on the Client> forum on iscabbs.
23:10 <myke> hmm well
23:10 <myke> i looked at the rejected patch parts, and couldn't figure out why
             they didn't work
23:10 <myke> everything matched so it should have patched
23:10 <myke> so i just did it manually
23:10 <myke> then
23:14 <Capa> then?
23:20 <Capa> what did you do manually?
23:22 <myke> applied the rejected patch hunks
23:23 <myke> the only other change is in /tmp/iscabbs-freebsd-myke.patch
23:23 <myke> can't figure out how to generate a proper patch file
23:23 <myke> that should work tho

Then the iscabbs-freebsd-myke.patch file contains:

I obviously didn't get a new APK up last week; I got way deep into the

going to abandon that for a little bit and get some other stuff working.

I can get swiping left and right to go backwards or forward pretty easily;
however, if I do that, you lose the ability to scroll.  I haven't figured
out how to get both those features at the same time, and scrolling is
necessary for long messages.

I guess I could make swipe-left mean "go to next page" along with the
"next" button doing that, too.  Seems a little too terminal based,
though.

Okay, let me type this instead of dictating.

Every forum has a "last read" pointer that keeps track of the last message you
read.  Right now, the raccoon client sets it every time you press "next."  If
you view a forum you've zapped and start reading, it will be added to your
"joined" list.

You can also "un-read" messages by reading a forum like Lobby> from the start
and then pressing Next> a few times.  It will look like you have unread Lobby>
posts if you don't read them all.

I'll get around to fixcing that at some point but right now just consider it a
known issue.

I think you can fix that by not changing the orientation of the screen
between pressing "Change User/BBS" and finally pressing "Done!"

Or you can download the new APK I just put up.  It has a scroller on
that username/password page, too, so you shouldn't need to fiddle with
the orientation.  And, if the bug was what I thought it was in paragraph
one, it shouldn't crash any more.

I did find a new issue: if you keep on hitting "all" like a drunked sailor
while you are logged in, it will crash.  I know how to fix that but it
involves some synchronization work that will require some time, so for
now: "don't do that."

Every time you press 'next' the client sets your message pointer.  If you go
back to message you've already read and press 'next', it will push you
"backwards" through the forum.

I should make it do
 1. only set when you leave the forum, and
 2. only set it if
                a) the message is greater than your last pointer, or
                b) you are in the "unread" mode.

This one makes links clickable.  Also, the "next" button turns green when

"next" your way out of the forum since it's harder to switch back to an

  Assuming you're not using shift+e to "upload" a new post, my guess is
  tehre is a char (blank space usually) after the last line. Use control+end
  to get to the end of the post and that should let you hit enter as normal
  and get the save dialog.

just put it back in the queue to retry.

There are some issues with that:

1. If it failed for a permanent reason, the user really doesn't want the phone
trying to post the same thing over and over again.

2. The connection to the BBS is stateful.  Maybe you can't post to Support> for
some reason, but then you switch to Babble>.  And now your post works.

In theory if you change forums really really fast after hitting "Post" your
post will go into the new forum.  I'm not sure it's possible in practice, and
the binary I put up last night will report the result of trying, so you will
know once it either completes or fails.

Dear Santa,

I wud like a kool toy space ranjur fer Xmas. Iv bena gud boy all yeer.

Yer Frend,

BiLLy


Dear Billy,

Nice spelling. You're on your way to a career in lawn care. How about I send
you a fucking book so you can learn to read and write? I'm giving your older
brother the space ranger.

At least HE can spell!

Santa


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Santa,

I have been a good girl all year, and the only thing I ask for is peace and joy
in the world for everybody!

Love,

Sarah


Dear Sarah,

You're parents smoked pot when they had you, didn't they?

Santa


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Santa,

I don't know if you can do this, but for Christmas, I'd like for my mommy and
daddy to get back together. Please see what you can do.

Love,

Teddy


Dear Teddy,

Look, your dad's banging the babysitter like a screen door in a hurricane. Do
you think he's gonna give that up to come back to your fat mom, who rides his
ass constantly? It's time to give up that dream. Let me get you some nice
Lago's instead.

Santa


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Santa,

I want a new bike, a Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, a drum kit, a
pony and a tuba.

Dear Francis,

Who names their kid "Francis" nowadays? I bet you're gay.

Santa

Dear Santa,

I left milk and cookies for you under the tree, and I left carrots for your
reindeer outside the back door.

Love,

Dear Susan,

Milk gives me the runs and carrots make the deer fart in my face when riding in
the sleigh. You want to do me a favor? Leave me a bottle of scotch.

Santa

Dear Santa,

I really want a go-kart for Christmas. Would you please bring me one that is
yellow with a green stripe? Thanks.

Love,

Luke


Dear Luke,

Let me give you a history lesson, kid. Two years ago, I brought you a bike. You
crashed it into a dumpster and knocked out two of your teeth. Last year, I gave
you a skateboard. You fell off of that, and ended up breaking your wrist. I
don't think your mom's health insurance plan can handle anymore trips to the
emergency room for you. This year, I'm bringing you a wheelchair. At the rate
you're going, you'll need it.

Santa


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Santa,

What do you do the other 364 days of the year? Are you busy making toys?

Your friend,

Thomas


Dear Thomas,

All the toys are made in China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I spend most of
my time making low-budget porno films. I unwind by drinking myself silly and
squeezing the asses of cocktail waitresses while losing money at the craps
table.

Hey, you wanted to know.

Santa

Dear Santa,

Do you see us when we're sleeping, do you really know when we're awake, like in

Dear Jessica,

Are you really that gullible? Good luck in whatever you do. I'm skipping your
house.

Dear Santa,

I would like you to please bring me a pet hamster for Christmas. I have other
things on my list, but I'd REALLY want a hamster. Could you please bring me
one?

Love,

Corey


Dear Corey,

Do you remember what happened the last time I gave you pets for Christmas? Both
the goldfish and the parakeet were dead within a month? If I give you any more
animals as gifts, I'm going to have those nut-jobs from P.E.T.A. all over my
ass. How about I bring you something that you can't kill? Like socks.

Santa


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Santa,

I've written you for three years now asking for a fire truck. Please, I really
really want a fire truck this year!

Dear Joey,

Let me make it up to you. While you sleep, I'm gonna torch your house. You'll
have more fire trucks than you'll know what to do with.

Santa

Dear Santa,

I need more Pokemon cards please! All my friends have more Pokemon cards than
me. Please see what you can do.

Love,

Michelle


Dear Michelle,

It blows my fucking mind. Kids are forcing their parents to buy hundreds of
dollars worth of these stupid cards, and none of you snot-nosed brats are even
learning to play the game. Let me get you something more your speed, like
"Chutes and Ladders."

Santa


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Santa,

I really really want a puppy this year. Please please please PLEASE PLEASE
could I have one?

Timmy


Timmy,

That whiney begging shit may work with your folks, but that crap doesn't work
with me. You're getting a sweater again.

Santa


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Santa,

Would you please bring me a new XBox 360, and a whole bunch of games to play on
it?

Aaron


Dear Aaron,

Do you really think your folks want me to give you another reason to sit in
front of the television all day long? Neither do I. Why don't you get your
chubby ass off the couch, and go play outside for a change. If you lose some of
your baby fat, maybe your friends will stop calling you "Lard-Butt" behind your
back.

Santa


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--

Dearest Santa,

We don't have a chimney in our house, how do you get into our home?

Love,

Marky


Mark,

First, stop calling yourself "Marky", that's why you're getting your ass
whipped at school. Second, you don't live in a house, you live in a low-rent
apartment complex. Third, I get inside your pad just like all the burglars do,
through your bedroom window.

Sweet Dreams,

Santa

December 14

Dearest John:
I went to the door today and the postman delivered a Partridge in a Pear Tree.
What a thoroughly delightful gift!B B  I couldn't have been more surprised.
With deepest love and devotion, Agnes


Miss Agnes McHolstein

Today the postman brought your very sweet gift. Just imagine - Two Turtle
Doves! I'm just delighted at your very thoughtful gift. They are just adorable.
All my love, Agnes

Dearest John: Oh, aren't you the extravagant one! Now I really must protest. I
don't deserve such generosity - Three French Hens! They are just delightful,
but I must insist, you've been too kind. Love, Agnes


Miss Agnes McHolstein
69 Cash Avenue

Dearest John:
Today the postman delivered Four Calling Birds. Now really, you're being too
romantic. They are beautiful, but don't you think that enough is enough?
Affectionately, Agnes


Miss Agnes McHolstein
69 Cash Avenue
Beaver Meadow, Col.
December 18

Dearest John:
What a surprise! Today the postman delivered Five Golden Rings - one for each
finger. You're just impossible, but I love it. Frankly, all those birds
squawking were beginning to get on my nerves. Love, Agnes


Miss Agnes McHolstein
69 Cash Avenue
Beaver Meadow, Col.
December 19

Dear John: When I opened the door, there were actually Six Geese-A-Laying on my
front steps. So you're back to the birds again, huh? Those geese are huge.
Where will I keep them? The neighbors are complaining and I can't sleep through
the racket. Please stop. Cordially, Agnes


Miss Agnes McHolstein
69 Cash Avenue
Beaver Meadow, Col.
December 20

John: What's with you and those fucking birds? Seven Swans-A-Swimming! What
kind of a goddamn joke is this? There's bird shit all over the house and they
never stop with the racket. I can't sleep at night and I'm a nervous wreck -
it's not funny. So stop with those fucking birds!
Sincerely, Agnes


Miss Agnes McHolstein
69 Cash Avenue
Beaver Meadow, Col.
December 21

OK Buster!
I think I prefer the birds. What the hell am I going to do with 8 Maids a
Milking? It's not enough with all these birds and maids a milking, but they had
to bring their goddamn cows! There's shit all over the lawn and I can't move in
my own house. Just lay off me, smartass! Agnes


Miss Agnes McHolstein
69 Cash Avenue
Beaver Meadow, Col.
December 22

Hey Shithead:
What are you, some kind of sadist? Now there are nine Pipers Piping! And Christ
do they play! They haven't stopped chasing those maids since they got here. The
cows are getting upset and they're stepping all over those screeching birds.
What am I going to do? The neighbors have started a petition to evict me!
You'll get yours! Agnes


Miss Agnes McHolstein
69 Cash Avenue
Beaver Meadow, Col.
December 23

You Rotten Prick!
Now there's Ten Ladies Dancing. I don't know why I call those sluts ladies.
They've been balling those pipers all night long. The cows can't sleep and
they've got diarrhea. My living room is a river of shit. The commissioner of
buildings has subpoenaed me to give cause why the building shouldn't be
condemned. I'm siccing the police on you. One who means it!!


Miss Agnes McHolstein
69 Cash Avenue
Beaver Meadow, Col.
December 24

Listen Fuckhead:
What's with the Eleven Lords a Leaping on those Maids and Ladies? Some of those
broads will never walk again. Those pipers ran through the maids and have been
committing sodomy with the cows! All 23 birds are dead, they've been trampled
to death in the orgy. I hope you're satisfied, you vicious, rotten swine. Your
sworn enemy, Agnes

From a friend:

Wild Bill was excited about his new 338 rifle and decided to try bear hunting.
He traveled up to Alaska, spotted a small brown bear and shot it. Soon after
there was a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a big black bear.

The black bear said, "That was a very bad mistake. That bear was my cousin. I'm
going to give you two choices. Either I maul you to death or we have sex."
After considering briefly, Wild Bill decided to accept the latter alternative.

So the black bear had his way with Wild Bill. Even though he felt sore for two
weeks, Bob soon recovered and vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip to
Alaska where he found the black bear and shot it dead. Right after, there was
another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear stood right next to
him.
The grizzly said, "That was a big mistake, Wild Bill. That bear was my cousin
and you've got two choices : Either I maul you to death or we have rough sex."
Again, Wild Bill thought it was better to cooperate with the grizzly bear than
be mauled to death. So the grizzly had his way with Wild Bill. Although he
survived, it took several months before Wild Bill fully recovered.

Now Wild Bill was completely outraged, so he headed back to Alaska and managed
to track down the grizzly bear and shot it. He felt sweet revenge, but then,
moments later, there was a tap on his shoulder.

He turned around to find giant polar bear standing there.

The polar bear looked at him and said, "Admit it Wild Bill, you don't come here
for the hunting, do you?

The Blind Cashier   A woman goes into Cabela's to buy a rod and reel for her
grandson's birthday. She doesn't know which one to get, so she just grabs one
and goes over to the counter.  The clerk was standing behind the counter
wearing dark shades.  She says to him, "Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me
anything about this rod and reel?"  He says, "Ma'am, I'm completely blind; but
if you'll drop it on the counter, I can tell you everything from the sound it
makes."She doesn't believe him but drops it on the counter anyway......He says,
"That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with a Zebco 404reel and 10-LB.
test line.  It's a good all-around combination, and it's on sale this week for
only $20.00."She says, "It's amazing that you can tell all that just by the
sound of it dropping on the counter. I'll take it!" As she opens her purse, her
credit card drops on the floor."Oh, that sounds like a Master Card," he says. 
She bends down to pick it up and accidentally farts.  At first she is really
embarrassed, but then realizes......there is no way the blind clerk could tell
it was her who tooted. Being blind, he wouldn't know that she was the only
person around?  The man rings up the sale and says, "That'll be $34.50 please."
The woman is totally confused by this and asks, "Didn't you tell me the rod and
reel were on sale for $20.00? How did you get $34.50?"He replies, "Yes, ma'am.
The rod and reel is $20.00, but the Duck Call is $11.00, and the Catfish Bait
is $3.50."She paid it and left without saying a word.

After being married for 50 years, I took a careful look at my wife one day and
said, "Fifty years ago we had a cheap house, a junk car, slept on a sofa bed
and watched a 10-inch black and white TV, but I got to sleep every night with a
hot 23-year-old girl.

Now ... I have a $500,000.00 home, a $35,000.00 car, a nice big bed and a large
screen TV, but I'm sleeping with a 73-year-old woman. It seems to me that
you're not holding up your side of things."

My wife is a very reasonable woman. She told me to go out and find a hot 23-
year-old girl and she would make sure that I would once again be living in a
cheap house, driving a junk car, sleeping on a sofa bed and watching a 10-inch
black and white TV.

Old Man And The Beaver

An  86-year-old man went to his doctor for his quarterly check-up...

The doctor asked him how he was feeling, and the 86-year-old said,
"Things are great and I've never felt better.  I now have a 20 year-old
bride who is pregnant with my child. So what do you think about that
Doc?"

The doctor considered his question for a minute and then began to tell a
story.  "I have an older friend, much like you, who is an avid hunter
and never misses a season.

One day he was setting off to go hunting.  In a bit of a hurry, he
accidentally picked up his walking cane instead of his gun.  As he neared
a lake, he came across a very large male beaver sitting at the water's edge..
He realized he'd left his gun at home and so he couldn't shoot the
magnificent creature.  Out of habit he raised his cane, aimed it at the
animal as if it were his favorite hunting rifle and went 'bang, bang'.
Miraculously, two shots rang out and the beaver fell over dead.

Now, what do you think of that?" asked the doctor..

The 86-year-old said, "Logic would strongly suggest that somebody else
pumped a couple of rounds into that beaver."

The doctor replied , "My point exactly."

Then he asked his lawyer the same question, but got the opposite advice: "Don't
let them intimidate you. Wear your best suit and an expensive tie."

Confused, the man went to his Rabbi who would surely know the correct answer.
He told him of the conflicting advice he had received, and asked what he should
do.

"Let me tell you a story," replied the Rabbi. "A woman, about to be married,
asked her mother what to wear on her wedding night. Her mother advised, 'Wear a
heavy, long, flannel nightgown that goes right up to your neck and wool socks.'
But when the woman asked her best friend, she got conflicting advice: 'Wear
your sexiest negligee, with a V-neck right down to your navel.'"

The man did not understand: "But Rabbi, what does all this have to do with my
problem with the IRS?" "It doesn't matter what you wear," replied the Rabbi,
"You're going to get screwed."

The children were lined up in the cafeteria of a Catholic elementary school for

note, and posted on the apple tray:

'Take only ONE . God is watching.'

Moving further along the lunch line, at the other end of the table was a large
pile of chocolate chip cookies.

A child had written a note, 'Take all you want. God is watching the apples.'

Dinner at Ryan's Steakhouse
---------------------------

Now, I know that there is a lot of embellishment that occurs on this site and I
am aware that a small number of things are perhaps sheer fabrication, but I
have a story to tell that is the absolute truth.

Funniest damn thing that has ever happened to me. A couple of weeks ago we
decided to cruise out to Ryan's Steakhouse for dinner. It was a Wednesday night
which means that macaroni and beef was on the hot bar, indeed the only night of
the week that it is served.

Wednesday night is also kid's night at Ryan's, complete with Dizzy the Clown
wandering from table to table entertaining the little bastards.

It may seem that the events about to be told have little connection to those
two circumstances, but all will be clear in a moment.

We went through the line and placed our orders for the all-you-can-eat hot bar
then sat down as far away from the front of the restaurant as possible in order
to keep the density of kids down a bit. Then I started my move to the hot bar.
Plate after plate of macaroni and beef were consumed that evening, I tell you
-- in all, four heaping plates of the pseudo-Italian ambrosia were shoved into
my belly. I was sated.

Perhaps bit too much, however. I had not really been feeling well all day, what
with a bit of gas and such. By the time I had eaten four overwhelmed plates of
food, I was in real trouble.

There was so much pressure on my diaphragm that I was having trouble breathing.


At the same time, the downward pressure was building. At first, I thought it
was only gas which could have been passed in batches right at the table without
to much concern.

Unfortunately, that was not to be.

After a minute or so it was clear that I was dealing with explosive diarrhea.
It's amazing how grease can make its way through your intestines far faster
than the food which spawned the grease to begin with, but I digress...

I got up from the table and made my way to the bathroom. Upon entering, I saw
two sinks immediately inside the door, two urinals just to the right of the
sinks, and two toilet stalls against the back wall.

One of them was a handicapped bathroom. Now, normally I would have gone to the
handicapped stall since I like to stretch out a bit when I take a good shit,
but in this case, the door lock was broken and the only thing I hate worse than
my wife telling me to stop cutting my toenails with a pair of diagional
wirecutters is having someone walk in on me while I am taking a shit.

I went to the normal stall.

In retrospect, I probably should have gone to the large, handicapped stall even
though the door would not lock because that bit of time lost in making the
stall switch proved to be a bit too long under the circumstances. By the time I
had walked into the regular stall, the pressure on my ass was reaching Biblical
proportions.

I began "The Move."

For those women who may be reading this, let me take a moment to explain "The
Move."

Men know exactly what their bowels are up to at any given second. And when the
time comes to empty the cache, a sequence of physiological events occur that
can not be stopped under any circumstances. There is a move men make that
involves simultaneously approaching the toilet, beginning the body turn to
position ones ass toward said toilet, hooking ones fingers into ones waistline,
and pulling down the pants while beginning the squat at the same time.

It is a very fluid motion that, when performed properly, results in the
flawless expulsion of shit at the exact same second that ones ass is properly
placed on the toilet seat. Done properly, it even assures that the choad is
properly inserted into the front rim of the toilet in the event that the piss
stream lets loose at the same time; it is truly a picture of coordination
rivaling that of a skilled ballet dancer.

I was about half-way into "The Move" when I looked down at the floor and saw a
pile of vomit that had been previously expelled by one of those little bastards
attending kids night; it was mounded up in the corner so I did not notice it
when I had first walked into the stall.

Normally, I would not have been bothered by such a thing, but I had eaten so
much and the pressure upward was so intense, that I hit a rarely experienced
gag reflex. And once that reflex started, combined with the intense pressure
upward caused by the bloated stomach, four plates of macaroni and beef started
coming up for a rematch.

What happened next was so quick that the exact sequence of events are a bit
fuzzy, but I will try to reconstruct them as best I can.

In that moment of impending projectile vomiting, my attention was diverted from
the goings-on at the other end.

To put a freeze frame on the situation, I was half crotched down to the toilet,
pants pulled down to my knees, with a load of vomit coming up my esophagus.
Now, most of you know that vomiting takes precidence over shit no matter what
is about to come slamming out of your ass. It is apparently an evolutionary
thing since shitting will not kill you, but vomiting takes a presence of mind
to accomplish so that you do not aspirate any food into the bronchial tubes and
perhaps choke to death. My attention was thus diverted.

At that very split second, my ass exploded in what can only be described as a
wake...you know, as in a newspaper headline along the lines of "30,000 Killed
In Wake of Typhoon Fifi" or something similar. In what seemed to be most
suitably measured in cubic feet, an enormous plug of shit the consistancy of
thick mud with embedded pockets of greasy liquid came flying out of my ass. But
remember, I was only half-way down on the toilet at that moment. The shit wave
was of such force and of just such an angle in relation to the back curve of
the toilet seat that it ricocheted off the back of the seat and slammed into
the wall at an angle of incidence equal to the angle at which it initally hit
the toilet seat.

Then I sat down.

Recall that when that event occured, I was already half-way to sitting anyway
and had actually reached the point of no return. I have always considered
myself as relatively stable gravitationally, but when you get beyond a certain
point, you're going down no matter how limber you may be. Needless to say, the
shit wave, though of considerable force, was not so sufficient so as to
completely glance off the toilet seat and deposit itself on the walls, unlike
what you would see when hitting a puddle with a high-pressure water hose; even
though you throw water at the puddle, the puddle gets moved and no water is
left to re-form a puddle. There was a significant amount of shit remaining on
about one-third of the seat rim which I had now just collapsed upon.

Now, back to the vomit...

While all the shitting was going on, the vomit was still on its way up. By the
time I had actually collapsed on the toilet, my mouth had filled up with a
goodly portion of the macaroni and beef I had just consumed.

OK, so what does the human body instinctively do when vomiting?

One bends over. So I bent over. I was still sitting on the toilet, though.

Therefore, bending over resulted in me placing my head above my now slightly-
opened legs, positioned in between my knees and waist. Also directly above my
pants which were now pulled down to a point just midway between my knees and my
ankles. Oh, did I mention that I was wearing not just pants, but sweat pants
with elastic on the ankles?

In one mighty push, some three pounds of macaroni and beef, two or three Cokes,
and a couple of Big, Fat Yeast Rolls were deposited in my pants...on the
inside...with no ready exit at the bottom down by my feet.

In the next several seconds, there were a handful of farts, a couple of turds,
and the event ended, yet I was now sitting there with my pants full of vomit,
my back covered in shit that had bounced off the toilet, spattered on three
ceramic-tiled walls to a height of about five feet, and still had enough force
to come back at me, covering the back of my shirt with droplets of liquid shit.
All while thick shit was spread all over my ass in a ring curiously in the
shape of a toilet seat.

And there was no fucking toilet paper.

What could I do but laugh. I must have sounded like a complete maniac to the
guy who then wandered into the bathroom. He actually asked if I was OK since I
was laughing so hard I must have sounded like I was crying hysterically. I
calmed down just enough to ask him if he would get the manager. And told him to
have the manager bring some toilet paper. When the manager walked in, he
brought the toilet paper with him, but in no way was prepared for what happened
next. I simply told him that there was no way I was going to explain what was
happening in the stall, but that I needed several wet towels and I needed him
to go ask my wife to come help me. I told him where we were sitting and he
left.

At that point, I think he was probably assuming that I had pissed just a bit in
my pants or something similarly benign.

About two minutes later, my wife came into the bathroom not knowing what was
wrong and with a certain amount of worry in her voice. I explained to her
(still laughing and having trouble getting out words) that I had a slight
accident and needed her help. Knowing that I had experienced some close calls
in the past, she probably assumed that I had laid down a small turd or
something and just needed to being the car around so we could bolt immediately.

Until I asked her, I'm sure she had no idea that she was about to go across the
street and purchase me new underwear, new socks, new pants, a new shirt, and
(by that time due to considerable leakage around the elastic ankles thingies)
new sneakers.

And she then started to laugh herself since I was still laughing. She began to
ask for an explanation as to what had happened when I promised her that I would
tell her later, but that I just needed to handle damage control for the time
being.

She left.

The manager then came back in with a half-dozen wet towels and a few dry ones.
I asked him to also bring a mop and bucket upon which he assured me that they
would clean up anything that needed to be cleaned.

Without giving him specific details, I explained that what was going on in that
stall that night was far in excess of what I would expect anyone to deal with,
what with most of the folks working at Ryan's making minimum wage of just
slightly above.

At that moment, I think it dawned on him exactly the gravity of the situation.
Then that manager went so far above the call of duty that I will be eternally
grateful for his actions. He hooked up a hose.

Fortunately, commercial bathrooms are constructed with tile walls and tile
floors and have a drain in the middle of the room in order to make clean up
easy. Fortunately, I was in a commercial bathroom.

He hooked up the hose to the spigot located under the sink as I began cleaning
myself up with the wet towels. Just as I was finishing, my wife got back with
the new clothes and passed them into the stall, whereupon I stuffed the
previously worn clothing into the plastic bag that came from the store, handing
the bag to my wife. I finished cleaning myself off and carefully put on my new
clothes, still stuck in the stall since I figured that it would be in bad taste
to go out of the stall to get redressed in the event I happened to be standing
there naked and some little bastard kid walked in. At that point, I had only
made a mess; I had not yet committed a felony and intended to keep it that way.


When I finished getting dressed, I picked up the hose and cleaned up the entire
stall, washing down the remains toward the drain in the center of the room. I
put down the hose and walked out of the bathroom. I had intended to go to the
manager and thank him for all he had done, but when I walked out, three of the
management staff were there to greet me with a standing ovation. I started
laughing so hard that I thought I was going to throw up again, but managed to
scurry out to the car where my wife was now waiting to pick me up by the front
door.

The upshot of all this is that I strongly recommend eating dinner at Ryan's
Steak House. They have, by far, the nicest management staff of any restaurant
in which I have eaten.

WOMEN AND CATS

I've never understood why women love cats.

Cats are independent, they don't listen, they don't come in when you call, they
like to stay out all night, and when they're home they like to be left alone
and sleep.

In other words, every quality that women hate in a man, they love in a cat.

GARDEN SNAKES CAN BE DANGEROUS...

Snakes also known as Garter Snakes (Thamnophissirtalis) can be dangerous. Yes,
grass snakes, not rattlesnakes. Here's why.

A couple in  Sweetwater  ,  Texas  , had a lot of potted plants. During a
recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them
from a possible freeze.

It turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the
plants. When it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under
the sofa.

She let out a very loud scream.

The husband (who was taking a shower) ran out into the living room naked to see
what the problem was. She told him there was a snake under the sofa.

He got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it. About that time
the family dog came and cold-nosed him on the behind. He thought the snake had
bitten him, so he screamed and fell over on the floor.

His wife thought he had had a heart attack, so she covered him up, told him to
lie still and called an ambulance.

The attendants rushed in, would not listen to his protests, loaded him on the
stretcher, and started carrying him out.

About that time, the snake came out from under the sofa and the Emergency
Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher. That's when the
man broke his leg and why he is still in the hospital.

The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a
neighbour who volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a
rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch.. Soon he decided it was
gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief.

But while relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt
the snake wriggling around. She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back
under the sofa.

The neighbour man, seeing her lying there passed out, tried to use CPR to
revive her.

The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store,
saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the
back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his
scalp to a point where it needed stitches.

The noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbour lying on
the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed that the snake had
bitten him. She went to the kitchen and got a small bottle of whiskey, and
began pouring it down the man's throat.

By now, the police had arrived.
Breathe here...

They saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken
fight had occurred. They were about to arrest them all, when the women tried to
explain how it all happened over a little garden snake!

The police called an ambulance, which took away the neighbour and his sobbing
wife.

Now, the little snake again crawled out from under the sofa and one of the
policemen drew his gun and fired at it. He missed the snake and hit the leg of
the end table. The table fell over, the lamp on it shattered and, as the bulb
broke, it started a fire in the drapes.

The other policeman tried to beat out the flames, and fell through the window
into the yard on top of the family dog who, startled, jumped out and raced into
the street, where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the
parked police car.

Meanwhile, neighbours saw the burning drapes and called in the fire department.
The firemen had started raising the fire ladder when they were halfway down the
street. The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires, put out the power, and
disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area (but they did get
the house fire out).

Time passed! Both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was
repaired, the dog came home, the police acquired a new car and all was right
with their world.

A while later they were watching TV and the weatherman announced a cold snap
for that night. The wife asked her husband if he thought they should bring in
their plants for the night.

And that's when he shot her.

A guy and a girl meet at a bar. They get along so well that they decide to go
to the girl's place. A few drinks later, the guy takes off his shirt and then
washes his hands.

He then takes off his trousers and washes his hands again.

The girl has been watching him and says, "You must be a dentist."

The guy, surprised, says "Yes....how did you figure that out?"

"Easy," she replied, "you keep washing your hands."

One thing led to another and they make love.
After they're done, the girl says, "You must be a good dentist."

The guy, now with a boosted ego says, "Sure, I'm a good dentist, how did you

"I didn't feel a thing!"

A visiting professor at Texas A & M University is giving a seminar on
the supernatural. To get a feel for his audience, he asks: "How many
people here believe in ghosts?" About 90 students raise their
hands. "Well that's a good start. Out of those of you who believe in
ghosts, do any of you think you've ever seen a ghost?" About 40
students raise their hands. "That's really good. I'm really glad you
take this seriously. Has anyone here ever talked to a ghost? 15
students raise their hands."That's a great response. Has anyone here
ever touched a ghost?" Three students raise their hands. "That's
fantastic. But let me ask you one question further.....Have any of
you ever made love to a ghost?" One student in the back raises his
hand. The professor is astonished. He takes off his glasses, takes a
step back, and says, "Son, all the years I've been giving this
lecture, no one has ever claimed to have slept with a ghost. You've
got to come up here and tell us about your experience." The redneck
student replies with a nod and a grin, and begins to make his way up
to the podium. The professor says, "Well, tell us what it's like to
have sex with a ghost." The student replies, "Ghost? Damn..... From
back there I thought you said 'goats'!"

A couple of women were playing golf one sunny Saturday morning. The
first of the twosome teed off and watched in horror as her ball
headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.
Indeed, the ball hit one of the men, and he immediately clasped his
hands together at his crotch, fell to the ground and proceeded to
roll around in evident agony. The woman rushed down to the man and
immediately began to apologize. She explained that she was a physical
therapist: "Please allow me to help. I'm a physical therapist and I
know I could relieve your pain if you'd allow me!", she told him
earnestly. "Ummph, oooh, nnooo, I'll be alright...I'll be fine in a
few minutes", he replied breathlessly as he remained in the fetal
position still clasping his hands together at his crotch. But she
persisted, and finally allowed her to help him. She gently took his
hands away an laid them to the side, she loosened his pants, and she
put her hands inside. She began to massage him. She then asked
him: "How does that feel?" To which he replied: "It feels great, but
my thumb still hurts like hell."

A man goes to a party and has too much to drink. His friends plead with him to
let them take him home. He says no -- he only lives a mile away.

About five blocks from party, the police pull him over for weaving and ask him
to get out of the car and walk the line. Just as he starts, the police radio
blares out a notice of a robbery taking place in a house just a block away. The
police tell the party animal to stay put, they will be right back and they hop
a fence and run down the street to the robbery.

The guy waits and waits and finally decides to drive home. When he gets there,
he tells his wife he is going to bed, and to tell anyone who might come looking
for him that he has the flu and has been in bed all day. A few hours later the
police knock on the door. They ask if Mr. Smith is there and his wife says yes.
They ask to see him and she replies that he is in bed with the flu and has been
so all day.

The police have his driver's license. They ask to see his car and she asks why.
They insist on seeing his car, so she takes them to the garage. She opens the
door. There sitting in the garage is the police car, with all its lights still
flashing.

True story, told by the driver at his first AA meeting.

From EschwaBBS.

Jan 24, 2005 1:06 PM from Alchemy
This morning I was carefully adhering to the unwritten rule of the city-
namely, keep your eyes downcast at less than a 45 degree angle at all times.

Normally, when walking along the busy sidewalks this keeps you from
stepping in dogshit, tripping over the homeless, or locking eyes with a
potential serial killer.  However, when emerging from the subway it can
also prevent you from seeing what's happening directly in front of you (due
to the oblique angle of the rising stairs).  This was the case this
morning, as the woman in front of me suddenly stopped and bent over to pick
up a dropped Metrocard.  Which caused me to do a full face-plant directly
into her ass.  I'm talking my nose right up her wazoo.  As you might
imagine, this startled both of us.  Unfortunately, her surprise and
position conspired against her, and a little fart was delivered
directly onto my face.  Judging by her mortification, I don't think the
woman will ever ride the subway again.

moneyA company, feeling it was time for a shakeup, hires a new CEO. This new
boss is determined to rid the company of all slackers.

On a tour of the facilities, the CEO notices a guy leaning on a wall. The room
is full of workers and he wants to let them know he means business!

The CEO walks up to the guy and asks, "And how much money do you make a week?"
Undaunted, the young fellow looks at him and replies, "I make $300.00 a week.
Why?"

The CEO then hands the guy $300 in cash and screams, "Here's a week's pay, now
GET OUT and don't come back!"

Feeling pretty good about his first firing, the CEO looks around the room and
asks "Does anyone want to tell me what that goof-off did here?"

With a sheepish grin, one of the other workers mutters, "Pizza delivery guy
from Domino's."

As a trucker stops for a red light, a blonde catches up. She jumps out
of her car, runs up to his truck, and knocks on the door. The trucker
lowers the window, and she says
"Hi, my name is Heather and you are losing some of your load." The
trucker ignores her and proceeds down the street.
When the truck stops for another red light, the girl catches up again.
She jumps out of her car, runs up and knocks on the door. Again, the
trucker lowers the window. As if they've never spoken, the blonde says
brightly,
"Hi my name is Heather, and you are losing some of your load!" Shaking
his head, the trucker ignores her again and continues down the street.
At the third red light, the same thing happens again. All out of
breath, the blonde gets out of her car, runs up, knocks on the truck
door. The trucker rolls down the window. Again she says
"Hi, my name is Heather, and you are losing some of your load!"
When the light turns green the trucker revs up and races to the next
light. When he stops this time, he hurriedly gets out of the truck, and
runs back to the blonde. He knocks on her window, and after she lowers
it, he says...
"Hi, my name is Kevin, it's winter in Sault Ste. Marie and I'm driving

TOP 8 MORONS OF 2004


1. WILL THE REAL DUMMY PLEASE STAND UP?
AT&T fired President John Walter after nine months, saying he lacked
intellectual leadership. He received a $26 million severance package. Perhaps
it's not Walter who's lacking intelligence.

2. WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDS:
Police in Oakland, CA spent two hours attempting to subdue a gunman who had
barricaded himself inside his home. After firing ten tear gas canisters,
officers discovered that the man was standing beside them in the police line,
shouting, "Please come out and give yourself up."

3. WHAT WAS PLAN B???
An Illinois man, pretending to have a gun, kidnapped a motorist and forced him
to drive to two different automated teller machines, wherein the kidnapper
proceeded to withdraw money from his own bank accounts.

4. THE GETAWAY!
A man walked into a Topeka, Kansas Kwik Stop and asked for all the money in the
cash drawer. Apparently, the take was too small, so he tied up the store clerk
and worked the counter himself for three hours until police showed up and
grabbed him.

5. DID I SAY THAT???
Police in Los Angeles had good luck with a robbery suspect who just couldn't
control himself during a lineup. When detectives asked each man in the lineup
to repeat the words: "Give me all your money or I'll shoot", the man shouted,
"that's not what I said!".

6. ARE WE COMMUNICATING???
A man spoke frantically into the phone: "My wife is pregnant and her
contractions are only two minutes apart".  "Is this her first child?" the
doctor asked. "No!" the man shouted, "This is her husband!"

7. NOT THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED!
In Modesto, CA, Steven Richard King was arrested for trying to hold up a Bank
of America branch without a weapon.  King used a thumb and a finger to simulate

8. THE GRAND FINALE!!!
Last summer, down on Lake Isabella, located in the high desert, an hour east of
Bakersfield, CA, some folks, new to boating, were having a problem.  No matter
how hard they tried, they couldn't get their brand new 22 foot boat, going.  It
was very sluggish in almost every maneuver, no matter how much power they
applied.  After about an hour of trying to make it go, they putted into a
nearby marina, thinking someone there may be able to tell them what was wrong.
A thorough topside check revealed everything in perfect working condition.  The
engine ran fine, the out-drive went up and down, and the propeller was the
correct size and pitch.  So, one of the marina guys jumped in the water to
check underneath.  He came up choking on water, he was laughing so hard.

NOW REMEMBER...THIS IS TRUE.

Under the boat, still strapped securely in place, was the trailer!

A secretary for a foreign embassy was entertaining a wealthy foreign
ambassador during lunch at a very expensive restaurant in uptown New
York.

The ambassador was so enthralled by the beauty and presence of this
secretary that he asked her to marry him. The secretary was startled,
but remembered that her boss told her never to insult foreign
dignitaries, so she decided to let him down easy.

"I'll only marry you under three conditions."

"Anything, anything," said the ambassador.

"First, you must buy me a 14-karat gold wedding band with a 72 carat
diamond, along with a 28 inch studded matching necklace for our
engagement."

Without hesitation, the ambassador picked up his cellular phone,
called his personal accountant, told him the instructions, and
said, "Yes, yes, I buy, I buy!"

The secretary thought that her first request was too easy, so she
thought of a more difficult situation.

"Second, I want you to build me a 58-acre mansion in the richest part
of the Poconos along with a 40 acre summer home in the sweetest
vineyards of France."

The ambassador picked up his phone, called his personal broker in New
York, then called another broker in France, and after his quick
conversation, he said, "Yes, yes, I build, I build!"

The secretary was very startled, and knew she must think of a final
request that would be impossible to live up to.

"Finally," she said. "I'll only marry you if you have a 10 inch
penis."

A sad face befell the ambassador, and he cupped his face in his
hands. After weeping in his native language for a few minutes, the
ambassador slowly lifted his head and said, "Ok, ok, I cut, I cut, I
cut!"

BODY: 
Being an Evil Overlord seems to be a good career choice. It pays well, there
are all sorts of perks and you can set your own hours. However every Evil
Overlord I've read about in books or seen in movies invariably gets overthrown
and destroyed in the end. I've noticed that no matter whether they are
barbarian lords, deranged wizards, mad scientists or alien invaders, they
always seem to make the same basic mistakes every single time. With that in
mind, allow me to present...

The Top 100 Things I'd Do
If I Ever Became An Evil Overlord

My Legions of Terror will have helmets with clear plexiglass visors, not
face-concealing ones.
My ventilation ducts will be too small to crawl through.
My noble half-brother whose throne I usurped will be killed, not kept
anonymously imprisoned in a forgotten cell of my dungeon.
Shooting is not too good for my enemies.
The artifact which is the source of my power will not be kept on the Mountain
of Despair beyond the River of Fire guarded by the Dragons of Eternity. It will
be in my safe-deposit box. The same applies to the object which is my one
weakness.
I will not gloat over my enemies' predicament before killing them.
When I've captured my adversary and he says, "Look, before you kill me, will
you at least tell me what this is all about?" I'll say, "No." and shoot him.
No, on second thought I'll shoot him then say "No."
After I kidnap the beautiful princess, we will be married immediately in a
quiet civil ceremony, not a lavish spectacle in three weeks' time during which
the final phase of my plan will be carried out.
I will not include a self-destruct mechanism unless absolutely necessary. If it
is necessary, it will not be a large red button labelled "Danger: Do Not Push".
The big red button marked "Do Not Push" will instead trigger a spray of bullets
on anyone stupid enough to disregard it. Similarly, the ON/OFF switch will not
clearly be labelled as such.
I will not interrogate my enemies in the inner sanctum -- a small hotel well
outside my borders will work just as well.
I will be secure in my superiority. Therefore, I will feel no need to prove it
by leaving clues in the form of riddles or leaving my weaker enemies alive to
show they pose no threat.
One of my advisors will be an average five-year-old child. Any flaws in my plan
that he is able to spot will be corrected before implementation.
All slain enemies will be cremated, or at least have several rounds of
ammunition emptied into them, not left for dead at the bottom of the cliff. The
announcement of their deaths, as well as any accompanying celebration, will be
deferred until after the aforementioned disposal.
The hero is not entitled to a last kiss, a last cigarette, or any other form of
last request.
I will never employ any device with a digital countdown. If I find that such a
device is absolutely unavoidable, I will set it to activate when the counter
reaches 117 and the hero is just putting his plan into operation.
I will never utter the sentence "But before I kill you, there's just one thing
I want to know."
When I employ people as advisors, I will occasionally listen to their advice.
I will not have a son. Although his laughably under-planned attempt to usurp
power would easily fail, it would provide a fatal distraction at a crucial
point in time.
I will not have a daughter. She would be as beautiful as she was evil, but one
look at the hero's rugged countenance and she'd betray her own father.
Despite its proven stress-relieving effect, I will not indulge in maniacal
laughter. When so occupied, it's too easy to miss unexpected developments that
a more attentive individual could adjust to accordingly.
I will hire a talented fashion designer to create original uniforms for my
Legions of Terror, as opposed to some cheap knock-offs that make them look like
Nazi stormtroopers, Roman footsoldiers, or savage Mongol hordes. All were
eventually defeated and I want my troops to have a more positive mind-set.
No matter how tempted I am with the prospect of unlimited power, I will not
consume any energy field bigger than my head.
I will keep a special cache of low-tech weapons and train my troops in their
use. That way -- even if the heroes manage to neutralize my power generator
and/or render the standard-issue energy weapons useless -- my troops will not
be overrun by a handful of savages armed with spears and rocks.
I will maintain a realistic assessment of my strengths and weaknesses. Even
though this takes some of the fun out of the job, at least I will never utter
the line "No, this cannot be! I AM INVINCIBLE!!!" (After that, death is usually
instantaneous.)
No matter how well it would perform, I will never construct any sort of
machinery which is completely indestructible except for one small and virtually
inaccessible vulnerable spot.
No matter how attractive certain members of the rebellion are, there is
probably someone just as attractive who is not desperate to kill me. Therefore,
I will think twice before ordering a prisoner sent to my bedchamber.
I will never build only one of anything important. All important systems will
have redundant control panels and power supplies. For the same reason I will
always carry at least two fully loaded weapons at all times.
My pet monster will be kept in a secure cage from which it cannot escape and
into which I could not accidentally stumble.
I will dress in bright and cheery colors, and so throw my enemies into
confusion.
All bumbling conjurers, clumsy squires, no-talent bards, and cowardly thieves
in the land will be preemptively put to death. My foes will surely give up and
abandon their quest if they have no source of comic relief.
All naive, busty tavern wenches in my realm will be replaced with surly,
world-weary waitresses who will provide no unexpected reinforcement and/or
romantic subplot for the hero or his sidekick.
I will not fly into a rage and kill a messenger who brings me bad news just to
illustrate how evil I really am. Good messengers are hard to come by.
I won't require high-ranking female members of my organization to wear a
stainless-steel bustier. Morale is better with a more casual dress-code.
Similarly, outfits made entirely from black leather will be reserved for formal
occasions.
I will not turn into a snake. It never helps.
I will not grow a goatee. In the old days they made you look diabolic. Now they
just make you look like a disaffected member of Generation X.
I will not imprison members of the same party in the same cell block, let alone
the same cell. If they are important prisoners, I will keep the only key to the
cell door on my person instead of handing out copies to every bottom-rung guard
in the prison.
If my trusted lieutenant tells me my Legions of Terror are losing a battle, I
will believe him. After all, he's my trusted lieutenant.
If an enemy I have just killed has a younger sibling or offspring anywhere, I
will find them and have them killed immediately, instead of waiting for them to
grow up harboring feelings of vengeance towards me in my old age.
If I absolutely must ride into battle, I will certainly not ride at the
forefront of my Legions of Terror, nor will I seek out my opposite number among
his army.
I will be neither chivalrous nor sporting. If I have an unstoppable
superweapon, I will use it as early and as often as possible instead of keeping
it in reserve.
Once my power is secure, I will destroy all those pesky time-travel devices.
When I capture the hero, I will make sure I also get his dog, monkey, ferret,
or whatever sickeningly cute little animal capable of untying ropes and
filching keys happens to follow him around.
I will maintain a healthy amount of skepticism when I capture the beautiful
rebel and she claims she is attracted to my power and good looks and will
gladly betray her companions if I just let her in on my plans.
I will only employ bounty hunters who work for money. Those who work for the
pleasure of the hunt tend to do dumb things like even the odds to give the
other guy a sporting chance.
I will make sure I have a clear understanding of who is responsible for what in
my organization. For example, if my general screws up I will not draw my
weapon, point it at him, say "And here is the price for failure," then suddenly
turn and kill some random underling.
If an advisor says to me "My liege, he is but one man. What can one man
possibly do?", I will reply "This." and kill the advisor.
If I learn that a callow youth has begun a quest to destroy me, I will slay him
while he is still a callow youth instead of waiting for him to mature.
I will treat any beast which I control through magic or technology with respect
and kindness. Thus if the control is ever broken, it will not immediately come
after me for revenge.
If I learn the whereabouts of the one artifact which can destroy me, I will not
send all my troops out to seize it. Instead I will send them out to seize
something else and quietly put a Want-Ad in the local paper.
My main computers will have their own special operating system that will be
completely incompatible with standard IBM and Macintosh powerbooks.
If one of my dungeon guards begins expressing concern over the conditions in
the beautiful princess' cell, I will immediately transfer him to a less
people-oriented position.
I will hire a team of board-certified architects and surveyors to examine my
castle and inform me of any secret passages and abandoned tunnels that I might
not know about.
If the beautiful princess that I capture says "I'll never marry you! Never, do
you hear me, NEVER!!!", I will say "Oh well" and kill her.
I will not strike a bargain with a demonic being then attempt to double-cross
it simply because I feel like being contrary.
The deformed mutants and odd-ball psychotics will have their place in my
Legions of Terror. However before I send them out on important covert missions
that require tact and subtlety, I will first see if there is anyone else
equally qualified who would attract less attention.
My Legions of Terror will be trained in basic marksmanship. Any who cannot
learn to hit a man-sized target at 10 meters will be used for target practice.
Before employing any captured artifacts or machinery, I will carefully read the
owner's manual.
If it becomes necessary to escape, I will never stop to pose dramatically and
toss off a one-liner.
I will never build a sentient computer smarter than I am.
My five-year-old child advisor will also be asked to decipher any code I am
thinking of using. If he breaks the code in under 30 seconds, it will not be
used. Note: this also applies to passwords.
If my advisors ask "Why are you risking everything on such a mad scheme?", I
will not proceed until I have a response that satisfies them.
I will design fortress hallways with no alcoves or protruding structural
supports which intruders could use for cover in a firefight.
Bulk trash will be disposed of in incinerators, not compactors. And they will
be kept hot, with none of that nonsense about flames going through accessible
tunnels at predictable intervals.
I will see a competent psychiatrist and get cured of all extremely unusual
phobias and bizarre compulsive habits which could prove to be a disadvantage.
If I must have computer systems with publically available terminals, the maps
they display of my complex will have a room clearly marked as the Main Control
Room. That room will be the Execution Chamber. The actual main control room
will be marked as Sewage Overflow Containment.
My security keypad will actually be a fingerprint scanner. Anyone who watches
someone press a sequence of buttons or dusts the pad for fingerprints then
subsequently tries to enter by repeating that sequence will trigger the alarm
system.
No matter how many shorts we have in the system, my guards will be instructed
to treat every surveillance camera malfunction as a full-scale emergency.
I will spare someone who saved my life sometime in the past. This is only
reasonable as it encourages others to do so. However, the offer is good one
time only. If they want me to spare them again, they'd better save my life
again.
All midwives will be banned from the realm. All babies will be delivered at
state-approved hospitals. Orphans will be placed in foster-homes, not abandoned
in the woods to be raised by creatures of the wild.
When my guards split up to search for intruders, they will always travel in
groups of at least two. They will be trained so that if one of them disappears
mysteriously while on patrol, the other will immediately initiate an alert and
call for backup, instead of quizzically peering around a corner.
If I decide to test a lieutenant's loyalty and see if he/she should be made a
trusted lieutenant, I will have a crack squad of marksmen standing by in case
the answer is no.
If all the heroes are standing together around a strange device and begin to
taunt me, I will pull out a conventional weapon instead of using my unstoppable
superweapon on them.
I will not agree to let the heroes go free if they win a rigged contest, even
though my advisors assure me it is impossible for them to win.
When I create a multimedia presentation of my plan designed so that my
five-year-old advisor can easily understand the details, I will not label the
disk "Project Overlord" and leave it lying on top of my desk.
I will instruct my Legions of Terror to attack the hero en masse, instead of
standing around waiting while members break off and attack one or two at a
time.
If the hero runs up to my roof, I will not run up after him and struggle with
him in an attempt to push him over the edge. I will also not engage him at the
edge of a cliff. (In the middle of a rope-bridge over a river of molten lava is
not even worth considering.)
If I have a fit of temporary insanity and decide to give the hero the chance to
reject a job as my trusted lieutentant, I will retain enough sanity to wait
until my current trusted lieutenant is out of earshot before making the offer.
I will not tell my Legions of Terror "And he must be taken alive!" The command
will be "And try to take him alive if it is reasonably practical."
If my doomsday device happens to come with a reverse switch, as soon as it has
been employed it will be melted down and made into limited-edition
commemorative coins.
If my weakest troops fail to eliminate a hero, I will send out my best troops
instead of wasting time with progressively stronger ones as he gets closer and
closer to my fortress.
If I am fighting with the hero atop a moving platform, have disarmed him, and
am about to finish him off and he glances behind me and drops flat, I too will
drop flat instead of quizzically turning around to find out what he saw.
I will not shoot at any of my enemies if they are standing in front of the
crucial support beam to a heavy, dangerous, unbalanced structure.
If I'm eating dinner with the hero, put poison in his goblet, then have to
leave the table for any reason, I will order new drinks for both of us instead
of trying to decide whether or not to switch with him.
I will not have captives of one sex guarded by members of the opposite sex.
I will not use any plan in which the final step is horribly complicated, e.g.
"Align the 12 Stones of Power on the sacred altar then activate the medallion
at the moment of total eclipse." Instead it will be more along the lines of
"Push the button."
I will make sure that my doomsday device is up to code and properly grounded.
My vats of hazardous chemicals will be covered when not in use. Also, I will
not construct walkways above them.
If a group of henchmen fail miserably at a task, I will not berate them for
incompetence then send the same group out to try the task again.
After I captures the hero's superweapon, I will not immediately disband my
legions and relax my guard because I believe whoever holds the weapon is
unstoppable. After all, the hero held the weapon and I took it from him.
I will not design my Main Control Room so that every workstation is facing away
from the door.
I will not ignore the messenger that stumbles in exhausted and obviously
agitated until my personal grooming or current entertainment is finished. It
might actually be important.
If I ever talk to the hero on the phone, I will not taunt him. Instead I will
say this his dogged perseverance has given me new insight on the futility of my
evil ways and that if he leaves me alone for a few months of quiet
contemplation I will likely return to the path of righteousness. (Heroes are
incredibly gullible in this regard.)
If I decide to hold a double execution of the hero and an underling who failed
or betrayed me, I will see to it that the hero is scheduled to go first.
When arresting prisoners, my guards will not allow them to stop and grab a
useless trinket of purely sentimental value.
My dungeon will have its own qualified medical staff complete with bodyguards.
That way if a prisoner becomes sick and his cellmate tells the guard it's an
emergency, the guard will fetch a trauma team instead of opening up the cell
for a look.
My door mechanisms will be designed so that blasting the control panel on the
outside seals the door and blasting the control panel on the inside opens the
door, not vice versa.
My dungeon cells will not be furnished with objects that contain reflective
surfaces or anything that can be unravelled.
If an attractive young couple enters my realm, I will carefully monitor their
activities. If I find they are happy and affectionate, I will ignore them.
However if circumstance have forced them together against their will and they
spend all their time bickering and criticizing each other except during the
intermittent occasions when they are saving each others' lives at which point
there are hints of sexual tension, I will immediately order their execution.
Any data file of crucial importance will be padded to 1.45Mb in size.
Finally, to keep my subjects permanently locked in a mindless trance, I will
provide each of them with free unlimited Internet access.
Of course, these are merely the Top 100 Things I'd do. Other suggestions have
been sent to me which didn't quite make the Top 100 List. But they are still so
good that I couldn't bear to throw them out. Therefore, as an expression of
gratitude, I have tossed them into...

I lost it four times for drunk driving.

Stole it?

The blonde says, Yes, and I killed the owner.

At this point the officer is getting stressed. You what?

The body is in the trunk. You can look if you want.

The officer slowly backs away and calls for back up. Within minutes, five
police cars show up, surrounding the car. A senior officer slowly approached
the car, clasping his half drawn gun.

The senior officer said, Could you step out of your vehicle please!

The blonde stepped out of the vehicle. Is there a problem, officer?

The officer responded, Yes, could you please open the trunk of your car
please?

The blonde opened the trunk, which was empty.

The officer said, Is this your car ma'am?

The blonde said, Yes, and handed over the registration papers.

The officer, understandably, is quite stunned.

One of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license.

The blonde handed a license to the officer.

The officer examined the license. He looked quite puzzled. Thank you. One of my
officers told me you didnt have a license, stole this car, and murdered the
owner.

The blonde replied, I bet you that liar told you I was speeding, too!

A man walks into a drug store with his 8-year old son. They happen to walk by
the condom display, and the boy asks, "What are these, Dad?"

The man matter-of-factly replies, "Those are called condoms, son. Men use them
to have safe sex."

"Oh I see," replied the boy. "Yes, I've heard of that in health class at
school."

He looks over the display and picks up a package of 3 and asks, "Why are there
3 in this package?"

The dad replies, "Those are for high school boys, one for Friday, one for
Saturday, and one for Sunday."

"Cool" says the boy. He notices a 6 pack and asks, "Then who are these for?"

"Those are for college men," the dad answers, "TWO for Friday, TWO for
Saturday, and TWO for Sunday."

"WOW!" exclaimed the boy, "Then who uses THESE?" he asks, picking up a 12 pack.

With a sigh and a tear in his eye, the dad replied, "Those are for married men.
One for January, one for February, one for March......."

WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)With his polite and well-mannered performance
widely panned in the first Presidential debate, President Barack Obama is under
mounting pressure to prove that he can act like an asshole in the second debate
tomorrow night, a campaign aide confirmed.

In America, we demand that our President remain cool and calm in a crisis but
go batshit in a debate, the aide said. Tuesday night is all about that second
piece.

Rather than unspooling a laundry list of facts and numbers as he did in the
first debate, this time Mr. Obama will focus on tearing Mr. Romney a new one.

Unfortunately, the aide acknowledged, such classic dick moves as dismissively
interrupting an opponent and laughing over his answers do not come naturally to
Mr. Obama: Thats why were having Joe Biden work with him.

But even as Mr. Obama worked around the clock to practice being a douche, Mitt
Romneys campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, doubted his efforts would succeed.

Being an asshole isnt a skill that you can just pick up overnight, Mr.
Rhoades said. Mitt Romneys been working on it all his life.

AFTERNOON SEX

The only way for a young couple to pull off a Sunday afternoon "quickie" with
their 8-year-old son in the
apartment was to send him out on the balcony with a popsicle and tell him to
report on all the neighborhood
activities.

"There's a car being towed from the parking lot," he shouted.
He began his commentary as his parents put their plan into
operation:
"An ambulance just drove b
y!"
"Looks like the Andersons have company," he called out.
"Matt's riding a new bike!"
"Looks like the Sanders are moving!"
"Jason is on his skateboard!"

After a few moments he announced, "The Coopers are having sex!!"

Startled, his mother and dad shot up in bed. Dad cautiously called out, "How do
you know they're having sex?"

"Jimmy Cooper is standing on his balcony with a Popsicle."

A married couple is traveling by car from Victoria to Prince George .
Being seniors, after almost eleven hours on the road, they were too tired to
continue and decided to take a room. But, they only planned to sleep for four
hours and then get back on the road.

When they checked out four hours later, the desk clerk handed them a bill for
$350.00.

The man explodes and demands to know why the charge is so high. He told the
clerk although it's a nice hotel; the rooms certainly aren't worth $350.00 for
four hours. Then the clerk tells him that $350.00 is the 'standard rate'. He
insisted on speaking to the Manager.

The Manager appears, listens to him, and then explains that the hotel has an
Olympic-sized pool and a huge conference centre that were available for us to
use.

"But we didn't use them," the husband said.

"Well, they are here, and you could have," explained the Manager.

The Manager went on to explain that the couple could also have taken in one of
the shows for which the hotel is famous. "We have the best entertainers from
New York , Hollywood , and Las Vegas perform here," the Manager says.

"But we didn't go to any of those shows," the husband said.

"Well, we have them, and you could have," the Manager replied.

No matter what amenity the Manager mentioned, the husband replied, "But we
didn't use it!"

The Manager is unmoved, and eventually the husband gave up and agreed topay. As
he didn't have the check book, he asked his wife to write the check.
She did and gave it to the Manager.

The Manager is surprised when he looks at the check. "But ma'am, this is made
out for only $50.00."

"That's correct. I charged you $300.00 for sleeping with me," she replied.

"But I didn't!" exclaims the Manager.

"Well, too bad, I was here, and you could have."

Don't mess with senior citizens..... They didn't get there by being stupid.

Your Brain on Obama: Waiting for the Man (SHORT VERSION)
by Randy Shields

(LONG VERSION:
http://blackagendareport.com/print/content/your-brain-obama-waiting-man )

This is your brain on Obama:

Smoking Obama increases apathy and reduces empathy regardless of race, creed or
color. Now blacks as well as whites don't care in the least how many
dark-skinned people America kills throughout the world. Before the Obama
epidemic, the entire American working class had no class consciousness, but now
it's most historically progressive element (blacks) has no race consciousness
either. (Blacks, like all factions of the Democrats, only have symbol
consciousness - tangible improvements are never required.)

For American capitalism, that Obama is some good shit ...

Using Obama makes some people prone to wild mood swings and abrupt changes in
personality. In their brainwashed cult-like state, Obama users have turned on
friends and colleagues who kept their principles regardless of which capitalist
flunky commits the crimes. What were shameful atrocities ten minutes before
Obama was inaugurated suddenly became badges of "toughness" after he swore to
uphold/destroy the Constitution. (Take your pick - that's what he does.) Obama
users need treatment. But unfortunately funds have been fast and furiously
diverted to buy guns for Mexican drug cartels.

Sometimes the initial Obama trip will ruin a life for years. After that first
big hit of Obama on election night four years ago, liberals soon papered over
their "Question Authority" bumper stickers with a smorgasbord of new ones:

"War Is Oftentimes The Answer"
"Love Your Mother Drone"
"All Options Are On The Table"
"Visualize World Domination"
"Live Simply - That's All You Can Afford Now, Assholes"
"The Earth Does Not Belong To Us - It Belongs To The U.S."
"Please Spy On Me, Strip Me, Check My Cavities, And Make Me Safe"
"Indefinite Detention And Execution Without Charge Or Trial: Fuck Yeah!"

Mainlining Obama emboldens liberals to express their racism in the
socially-acceptable way of hating another "other," the Muslims, whose women
cover up their heads and sometimes aren't allowed to drive. Things that keep
white liberal women awake at night. These liberals are righteously certain that
head scarves and no learner's permits are bigger problems for Muslims than
racist American goons kicking down Muslim doors at midnight and taking away
adult males to be tortured and jailed for years without charge or trial, or
Muslim children living in constant terror of America's flying killer robots
that circle the skies above their schools and houses.

Enjoy your freedom, ladies, as you drive from your non-paying job at home to
your three/fourths-paying job at work while being carpet-bombed by the messages
of "your" society, freedom central, that says you're either good for sex or
good for nothing. But damn, those head scarves could lead to sharia law. And
lawn jockeys replaced by camel jockeys in the coming Allahbama! The horror, the
horror ...

Snorting Obama causes Hollywood celebrities to stand on the corner of Sunset
and Vine, waiting for the Man for four years. When the Man finally drove up and
rolled down the window, he took $15 million in exchange for this: "Yo, homies,
you are way too rich and important to be treated like a plague of locusts
anymore. I personally don't care who you're fucking or how you want to
consecrate it. Just be responsible and practice safe democracy: never be a
protester who fucks over a cop, never be a whistle blower who fucks over my
government, never be a peasant who fucks over our demockracy-dispensing
soldiers and, most importantly, never ever interfere with a rich person getting
richer. Ah, you like that last one! Thanks for the cash! Love the rainbows!
Peace out ... and step on it, I have to be at the pro-choice rally in 10
minutes to deliver my latest historic speech, 'Combating the Politics of Fear.'
I hope the brochures are ready about the mysterious new group that's backing
Romney: the 'Mormon Tabernacle Baby Fuckers and Coat Hangers for Christ
Choir.'"

Throwing back too many cold wet Obamas can make union members forget that the
current administration never lifted a finger to get the Employee Free Choice
Act passed even though unions gave millions of dollars to Obama's previous and
current campaigns. See, junkies aren't always skinny shadows in an alleyway.
They can also be potbellied autoworkers taking a forty year spin (if they're
really lucky) in the walking dead wage-slave treadmill.

Breathing in secondhand Obama makes right wing politicians absolutely crazy.
They're getting nearly everything they want, but they hate it coming from a
black man so they become even more outrageous to justify their purpose and
donations. What will they do in January when Obama starts shot-gunning them
with Social Security and Medicare cuts! OMG, just close your eyes and enjoy it,
Mitt and Newt, and all you other unelectable Republicans with ridiculous names.
(What will be the names of Republican presidential candidates four years from
now - Spooge, Suds, Glitch, Glub, Santorum, or will the eventual nominee's name
simply be changed to He Hate Me?)

You don't get it. You're the joke now - all of the capitalists' most important
business is transacted through the Democrats. You're the jesters and clowns. No
one trusts you with how to roll back working class gains in Central and South
America and give them back to the landed oligarchs and Wall Street. No one
trusts you to breath new life into the formerly moribund American nuclear power
industry. And you're a long way from getting your black belt in
Judo-Christianity and being able to instantly subvert the Arab Spring, turning
it into a divide and conquer bloodbath for the benefit of the United States of
Israel. They trust Obama and the Democrats for these "achievements." Can you
stand on your head, Mitt? Cool. What about walking on your hands? Or a
cartwheel - let's see a cartwheel.

William Burrough's explained Obama's "Naked Lunch" presidency a long time ago:

1) "Never give anything away for nothing" - like drawing down in Iraq while
doubling up in Afghanistan and expanding war into Pakistan, Yemen and Libya.

2) "Never give more than you have to (always catch the buyer hungry and always
make him wait)" - like: after eight years of the Bush/Cheney rampaging evil,
give back some verbal crumbs but nothing tangible.

3) "Always take back everything if you possibly can" - like Social Security and
Medicare, promised prosecution of CIA torturers and spying telecom companies,
or offers of a public option in healthcare and closing Guantanamo.

So there you are, America: jonesin', begging for a taste ...

Standing on the corner on November 6 waiting for the Man.

Snoring Solution

The guys were all at a deer camp. No one wanted to room with Tom, because he
snored so badly. They decided it wasn't fair to make one of them stay with him
the whole time, so they voted to take turns.

The first guy slept with Tom and comes to breakfast the next morning with his
hair a mess and his eyes all bloodshot. They said, "Man, what happened to you?
He said, "Tom snored so loudly, I just sat up and watched him all night."

The next night it was a different guy's turn. In the morning, same thing, hair
all standing up, eyes all bloodshot. They said, "Man, what happened to you? You
look awful! He said, 'Man, that Tom shakes the roof with his snoring. I watched
him all night."
He said, "Well, we got ready for bed. I went and tucked Tom into bed, patted
him on the butt, and kissed him good night.
Tom sat up and watched me all night."

Oldie but goodie...

Pocket Taser Stun Gun, a great gift for the wife. This was written by a guy who
purchased his lovely wife a "pocket Taser" for their anniversary.

Last weekend I saw something at Larry's Pistol & Pawn Shop that sparked my
interest. The occasion was our 22nd anniversary and I was looking for a little
something extra for my wife Toni. What I came across was a 100,000 volt,
pocket/purse-sized taser. The effects of the taser were suppose to be short
lived, with no long-term adverse affect on your assailant, allowing her
adequate time to retreat to safety.... WAY TOO COOL!

Long story short, I bought the device and brought it home. I loaded two triple
A batteries in the darn thing and pushed the button. Nothing! I was
disappointed. I learned, however, that if I pushed the button AND pressed it
against a metal surface at the same time; I'd get the blue arch of electricity
darting back and forth between the prongs. Awesome!!! Unfortunately, I have yet
to explain to Toni what that burn spot is on the face of her microwave.

Okay, so I was home alone with this new toy, thinking to myself that it
couldn't be all that bad with only two triple-a batteries, right?!!!

There I sat in my recliner, my cat Gracie looking on intently (trusting little
soul) while I was reading the directions and thinking that I really needed to
try this thing out on a flesh & blood moving target. I must admit I thought
about zapping Gracie (for a fraction of a second) and thought better of it. She
is such a sweet cat. But, if I was going to give this thing to my wife to
protect herself against a mugger, I did want some assurance that it would work
as advertised. Am I wrong?

So, there I sat in a pair of shorts and a tank top with my reading glasses
perched delicately on the bridge of my nose, directions in one hand, taser in
another. The directions said that a one-second burst would shock and disorient
your assailant; a two-second burst was supposed to cause muscle spasms and a
major loss of bodily control; a three-second burst would purportedly make your
assailant flop on the ground like a fish out of water. Any burst longer than
three seconds would be wasting the batteries.

All the while I'm looking at this little device measuring about 5" long, less
than 3/4 inch in circumference; pretty cute really and loaded with two itsy,
bitsy triple-a batteries, thinking to myself, "no possible way!"

What happened next is almost beyond description, but I'll do my best.....

I'm sitting there alone, Gracie looking on with her head cocked to one side as
to say, "don't do it master," reasoning that a one-second burst from such a
tiny little ole thing couldn't hurt all that bad.. I decided to give myself a
one-second burst just for the heck of it. I touched the prongs to my naked
thigh, pushed the button, and HOLY MOTHER, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION@!@$@$%!@
*!!!

I'm pretty sure Jessie Ventura ran in through the side door, picked me up in
the recliner, then body slammed us both on the carpet, over and over and over
again. I vaguely recall waking up on my side in the fetal position, with tears
in my eyes, body soaking wet, both nipples on fire, testicles nowhere to be
found, with my left arm tucked under my body in the oddest position, and
tingling in my legs.

The cat was standing over me making meowing sounds I had never heard before,
licking my face, undoubtedly thinking to herself, "do it again, do it again!"

Note: If you ever feel compelled to "mug" yourself with a taser, one note of
caution: there is no such thing as a one-second burst when you zap yourself.
You will not let go of that thing until it is dislodged from your hand by a
violent thrashing about on the floor. A three second burst would be considered
conservative.

SON-OF-A-.. that hurt like he**!!! A minute or so later (I can't be sure, as
time was a relative thing at that point), collected my wits (what little I had
left), sat up and surveyed the landscape. My bent reading glasses were on the
mantel of the fireplace. How did they up get there??? My triceps, right thigh
and both nipples were still twitching. My face felt like it had been shot up
with Novocain, and my bottom lip weighed 88 lbs. I'm still looking for my
testicles? I'm offering a significant reward for their safe return.

Later when Jeff went to the kitchen to get some refreshments Sandy followed him

admitted, "Well, yes I did." She said "you can have it, but it will cost you
$100." After a minute or two, Jeff indicates that he is interested. She tells
him that since Dave works Friday afternoons and Jeff doesn't, that Jeff should
come to their house around 2:00 PM on Friday.
Friday came and Jeff went to her house at 2:00 PM. After paying her the $100,
they went to the bedroom, had sex for a few hours and then Jeff left.
Dave came home about 6:00 PM and asked his wife, "Did Jeff come by this
afternoon?" Totally shocked, Sandy replied, "Yes, he did stop by for a few
minutes." Next Dave asked, "Did Jeff give you $100?" Sandy thought, 'Oh hell,
he knows!' reluctantly she said, "Yes, he did give me $100." "Good," Dave says.
"Jeff came by the office this morning and borrowed the $100 from me and said
that he'd stop by our house on his way home and pay me back. It's so good to
have a friend you can trust."

WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report) - The international terror group known as Al
Qaeda announced its dissolution today, saying that "our mission of destroying
the American economy is now in the capable hands of the U.S. Congress."

In an official statement published on the group's website, the current leader
of Al Qaeda said that Congress's conduct during the so-called "fiscal-cliff"
showdown convinced the terrorists that they had been outdone.

"We've been working overtime trying to come up with ways to terrorize the
American people and wreck their economy," said the statement from Al Qaeda
leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. "But as terrorists, every now and then you have to
step back and admire when someone else has beaten you at your own game," he
said. "This is one of those times."

The Al Qaeda leader was fulsome in his praise for congressional leaders,
saying, "We have made many scary videos in our time but none as terrifying as
Mitch McConnell."

A blonde got lost in her car in a snow storm. She remembered what her dad had
once told her. "If you ever get stuck in a snow storm, wait for a snow plow and
follow it."Pretty soon a snow plow came by, and she started to follow it. She
followed the plow for about forty five minutes. Finally the driver of the truck
got out and asked her what she was doing. She explained that her dad had told
her if she ever got stuck in the snow, to follow a plow.The driver nodded and
said, "Well, I'm done with the Wal-Mart parking lot, now you can follow me over
to K-Mart."

Some real-life humor...

So the wife and I meet up with a couple we are friends with, and a couple they
are friends with.  Having a great time, went to a bar to see a band... drinks,
dancing, laughs, a good time was had by all.  Finally everyone decides to pack
it in and go get a late night snack.  Off to the diner we go.

Sitting at the diner all sorts of hilarious conversation ensues, and at one
point there's a refernce to to masturbation.  I laughingly suggest to my buddy
that he should try the other hand, it's like having an affair.  Everyone shuts
up and I hear a "let's not go there."

Turns out the couple they brought along had just gotten back together after the
guy had cheated.  Hey, how could I know?  I felt bad at the moment but had a
good laugh at home.

The goal of the test was to see how much power the rotating blades could
generate, but the duty officers were ill-prepared, and the reactor design badly
flawed.  One operator, arriving at his station, was confused by the log book. 
He called someone else to inquire: "What shall I do?" he asked.  "In the
program, there are instructions of what to do, and then a lot of things crossed
out."  The other person thought for a minute, then replied, "Follow the
crossed-out instructions."

Do They Know It's Christmas Time Lyrics by Band Aid

(lyrics are written by chloe glass)

Paul Young
It's Christmas time, there's no need to be afraid
At christmas time, we let in light and we banish shade

Boy George
And in our world of plenty, we can spread a smile of joy!
Throw your arms around the world at christmas time

(Phil Collins on the drums)

George Micheal
But say a prayer - pray for the other ones
At christmas time

Simon Le Bon
it's hard, but when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window

Sting and Simon Le Bon
And it's a world of dreaded fear
Where the only water flowing is a bitter sting of tears
And the christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom

Bono
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life

Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow

Do they know it's christmas time at all?

Here's to you
Raise your glass for everyone
Here's to them
Underneath that burning sun

Do they know it's christmas time at all?

Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's christmas time and
Feed the world
Let them know it's christmas time and
Feed the world
Let them know it's christmas time and
Feed the world
Let them know it's christmas time and
Feed the world
Let them know it's christmas time and
Feed the world
Let them know it's christmas time

Lyrics for Song: Hard Candy Christmas
Lyrics for Album: Other Songs

Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair
Maybe I'll move somewhere
Maybe I'll get a car
Maybe I'll drive so far
They'll all lose track
Me, I'll bounce right back

Maybe I'll sleep real late
Maybe I'll lose some weight
Maybe I'll clear my junk
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine
Me, I'll be just

Fine and Dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow get me way down

Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew
Maybe I'll just lie low
Maybe I'll hit the bars
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn
Me, I will go on

Maybe I'll settle down
Maybe I'll just leave town
Maybe I'll have some fun
Maybe I'll meet someone
And make him mine
Me, I'll be just

Fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting throung tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

I'll be fine and dandy
Lord it's like a hard candy christmas
I'm barely getting through tomorrow
But still I won't let
Sorrow bring me way down

'Cause I'll be fine

Oh, I'll be fine

Rusty Chevrolet (to the tune Jingle Bells) by Da Yoopers
Driving thru the snow in my rusty Chevrolet
Down the road I go, sliding all the way
I need new piston rings
I need some new snow tires
My car is held together by a piece of chicken wire

Oh rust and smoke the heater's broke
the door just blew away
I light a match to see the dash
and then I start to pray
The frame is bent the muffler went
the radio is ok
Oh what fun it is to drive this rusty Chevrolet

Bouncing thru the snowdrifts in a big blue cloud of smoke
People laugh as I drive by I wonder what's the joke
I got to get to ShopKo to pick up the layaway
cuz Santa Claus is commin soon in his big ol rusty sleigh

(repeat second verse)

Lyrics for Song: A Candle in The Window
Lyrics for Album: Alabama Christmas

There's a road that I remember leading to a special place
Where the door was always open to a smiling face
There's a picture on the mantle of a boy that looks like me
It's always the same, there's a stocking with my name
And a candle in the window, a flame against the night

There's a candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window

Maybe it's just wishful thinking I can hear the sleigh bells ring
Almost taste the pie she's baking, it's Christmas Eve

And there's a candle in the window, a flame against the night
The candle in the window, it's like God's perfect light
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart

Wherever the years may take me no matter how far I go
There's going to be a candle burning, it's always nice to know
It don't take a lot of money to know what riches are
Just a candle in the window and Christmas in your heart

Lyrics for Song: Do You Hear What I Hear
Lyrics for Album: Traditional Christmas Songs

Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star
Dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite

Said the little lamb to the shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky shepard boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song
High above the tree
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea

Said the shepard boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace wall mighty king
Do you know what I know
A child, a child
Shivers in the cold
Let us bring him silver and gold
Let us bring him silver and gold

Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace people everywhere
Listen to what I say
The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

The child, the child
Sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light

So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
And a new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

And so this is Christmas      War is over
For weak and for strong       If you want it
For rich and the poor ones    War is over
The road is so long           Now
And so happy Christmas        War is over
For black and for white       If you want it
For yellow and red ones       War is over
Let's stop all the fight      Now

"Do They Know It's Christmas?"

1: It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

2: But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that ring
There are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
Feed the world
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

3: And there won't be snow in Africa
This Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

BRIDGE:
(Here's to you) raise a glass for everyone
(Here's to them) underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

END: Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time

END: (repeat & fade)

Lyrics With Performers
(Paul Young)
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade
(Boy George)
And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

(George Michael)
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time it's hard
(Simon LeBon)
But when you're having fun
There's a world outside your window
(Sting) And it's a world of dread and fear
Where the only water flowing is
(Bono joins in)
The bitter sting of tears
And the Christmas bells that are ringing
Are clanging chimes of doom
(Bono only) Well, tonight thank God it's them instead of you.

(Everyone)
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time.
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life
Where nothing ever grows
No rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time
Feed the world
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

(Paul Young)
Here's to you
raise a glass for everyone
Here's to them
underneath that burning sun
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Chorus (Everyone)
Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Firefall - You Are The Woman Lyrics
Album: Greatest Hits



You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

It's not so much the things you say to me
It's not the things you do
It's how I feel each time you're close to me
That keeps me close to you, woh oh

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

It's not so much your pretty face I see
It's not the clothes you wear
It's more that special way you look at me
That always keeps me there, woh oh woh

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

It's hard to tell you all the love I'm feeling
That's just not my style
You've got a way to send my senses reeling
Every time you smile, woh oh

You are the woman that I've always dreamed of
I knew it from the start
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart
I saw your face and that's the last I've seen of my heart

Of my heart
Oh oh of my heart

The song, "Auld Lang Syne," playing in the background, is sung at the
stroke of midnight in almost every English-speaking country in the world
to bring in the new year. At least partially written by Robert Burns in
the 1700's, it was first published in 1796 after Burns' death. Early
variations of the song were sung prior to 1700 and inspired Burns to
produce the modern rendition. An old Scotch tune, "Auld Lang Syne"
literally means "old long ago," or simply, "the good old days."

If the music doesn't start in a few seconds, click here.

Auld Lang Syne

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and days of auld lang syne?
For auld lang syne, my dear,
for auld lang syne,
we'll take a cup of kindness yet,
for auld lang syne.

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind?
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and days of auld lang syne?
And here's a hand, my trusty friend
And gie's a hand o' thine
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet
For auld lang syne

My name is Zak Bagans. I never believed in ghosts until I came face-to-face
with one. So I set out on a quest to capture what I once saw onto video. With
no big camera crews following us around, I am joined only by my fellow
investigator Nick Groff and our equipment tech, Aaron Goodwin. The three of us
will travel to some of the most highly active paranormal locations where we
will spend an entire night locked down from dusk until dawn. Raw. Extreme.
These are our Ghost Adventures.

"Two new lunch restaurants have just hung up their menus next door to each
other on Beak Street, each being so much more interesting for the existence and
proximity of the other. Let me explain:
        Low Fat Feast is a place that does what it says on the tin. Most
faithfully. The portions are tiny, the food devoid of fat (and hence, of
flavor). The (floury) bread is spread with something thin and almost yellow
that bears no resemblance to butter. The mayonnaiseWell, suffice to say it
simply isnt. And yet the place is jammed with people of a lunchtime and theres
a queue for tables that stretches out onto the street. My, but were very
bothered about our figures these days! I predict the current fervor will last
until the end of August when Selfridges will have sold every last thread of its
splendid swimwear collection, and then well all go back to stuffing our faces.
        Next door to the dietary establishment is Restaurant La Ronde. This
place has a newspaper article stuck up in its window, warning of the dangers of
dieting. Its food offers plentiful aid to any diner at risk from such perils. I
went in yesterday for a splendid finnan haddock, which came with one of the
richest cream sauces Ive ever tasted. It should be noted, however, that the
finnan haddock served at Low Fat Feast, though bone dry and half the size, is
oddly similar. Indeed, if you compare the two menus, you begin to discern a
pattern. Methinks I must get backstage to investigate the kitchen arrangements
of these two easily uneasy neighbors. Lastly, would it surprise you to hear
that the clientele of Low Fat Feast are, for the most part, on the large side,
while those who dine at Restaurant La Ronde are a distinctly slender bunch?"

MacArthur Park  (sung by Donna Summer):

Spring was never waiting for us, girl
It ran one step ahead
As we followed in the dance
Between the parted pages and were pressed,
In love's hot, fevered iron
Like a striped pair of pants

CHORUS:
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down...
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!

I recall the yellow cotton dress
Foaming like a wave
On the ground around your knees
The birds, like tender babies in your hands
And the old men playing checkers by the trees

CHORUS

There will be another song for me
For I will sing it
There will be another dream for me
Someone will bring it
I will drink the wine while it is warm
And never let you catch me looking at the sun
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
You'll still be the one.

I will take my life into my hands and I will use it
I will win the worship in their eyes and I will lose it
I will have the things that I desire
And my passion flow like rivers through the sky.
And after all the loves of my life
After all the loves of my life
I'll be thinking of you
And wondering why...

MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark
All the sweet, green icing flowing down...
Someone left the cake out in the rain
I don't think that I can take it
'cause it took so long to bake it
And I'll never have that recipe again
Oh, no!
Oh, no
No, no
Oh NO!

"It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man
stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit
belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust
and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and
again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does
actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great
devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the
end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at
least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those
cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."

All I Want Is You lyrics
Songwriters: LIVINGSTON, JAY / EVANS, RAY

You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
You say you want your story to remain untold

But all the promises we made
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it
A treasure just to look upon it
All the riches in the night

You say you'll give me eyes in a world of blindness
A river in a time of dryness
A harbour in the tempest
[ Lyrics from: http://www.lyricsmode.com/lyrics/u/u2/all_i_want_is_you.html ]
But all the promises we make
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You say you want your love to work out right
To last with me through the night

You say you want diamonds on a ring of gold
Your story to remain untold
Your love not to grow cold

All the promises we break
From the cradle to the grave
When all I want is you

You
All I want is...you
All I want is...you
All I want is...you

"Now to the root of the matter. The great unmentionable evil at the center of
our culture is monotheism. From a barbaric Bronze Age text known as the Old
Testament, three anti-human religions have evolved --Judaism, Christianity,
Islam. These are sky-god religions. They are, literally, patriarchal --God is
the omnipotent father-- hence the loathing of women for 2,000 years in those
countries afflicted by the sky-god and his earthly male delegates. The sky-god
is a jealous god, of course. He requires total obedience from everyone on
earth, as he is in place not for just one tribe but for all creation. Those who
would reject him must be converted or killed for their own good. Ultimately,
totalitarianism is the only sort of politics that can truly serve the sky-god's
purpose. Any movement of a liberal nature endangers his authority and that of
his delegates on earth. One God, one King, one Pope, one master in the factory,
one father-leader in the family home."

And now for something a little melodramatic I came across...

"Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever
encountered to help me make the big choices in life.  Because almost everything
- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarassment or failure -
these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly
important.  Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to
avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.  You are already naked.
There is no reason not to follow your heart."

                                        -Steve Jobs

The real reason why Zen has always called itself the way of instantaneous
awakening: "It is not just that satori (enlightenment) comes quickly and
unexpectedly, all of a sudden, for mere speed has nothing to do with it. The
reason is that Zen is a liberation from time. For if we open our eyes and see
clearly, it becomes obvious that there is no other time than this instant, and
that the past and the future are abstractions without any concrete reality.

"Until this has become clear, it seems that our life is all past and future,
and that the present is nothing more than the infinitesimal hairline which
divides them. From this comes the sensation of 'having no time,' of a world
which hurries by so rapidly that it is gone before we can enjoy it. But through
'awakening to the instant' one sees that this is the reverse of the truth: it
is rather the past and future which are the fleeting illusions, and the present
which is eternally real."

Apocalypse does not point to a fiery Armageddon but to the fact that our
ignorance and our complacency are coming to an end. Our divided, schizophrenic
worldview, with no mythology adequate to coordinate our conscious and
unconscious -- that is what is coming to an end. The exclusivism of there being
only one way in which we can be saved, the idea that there is a single
religious group that is in sole possession of the truth -- that is the world as
we know it that must pass away. What is the kingdom? It lies in our realization
of the ubiquity of the divine presence in our neighbors, in our enemies, in all
of us. -- Joseph Campbell, Thou Art That, p. 107

"We are living in a culture entirely hypnotized by the illusion of time, in
which the so-called present moment is felt as nothing but an infinitesimal
hairline between an all-powerfully causative past and an absorbingly important
future. We have no present. Our consciousness is almost completely preoccupied
with memory and expectation. We do not realize that there never was, is, nor
will be any other experience than present experience. We are therefore out of
touch with reality. We confuse the world as talked about, described, and
measured with the world which actually is. We are sick with a fascination for
the useful tools of names and numbers, of symbols, signs, conceptions and
ideas." ~Alan Watts
