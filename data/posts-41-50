Gal Civ II>

You can pretty much just hit return until you've won the game as I recall. Or
was that GalCiv I? They did away with too much of the micromanagement in favor
of auto features. Auto colonizing, auto updating planets and ships, etc.

Endless Space seems like an improvement over that so far, but it hasn't shown
anything really extraordinary in the 4x field so far. If you like 4x games,
you'll probably like Endless Space, just don't expect it to wow you with
amazing new game play or challenges.

Ragnarok Odyssey (Vita)>

So I got the thing on the 1st.  I've been goofing around with RO.  It has been
kind of fun.  They certainly don't go out of their way to explain much of
anything (it may be in the online manual, but who reads those?) to the player.

I've done some solo play and some multi.  I have created rooms asking for help
and had people jump in and help me get through Chapters 1 and 2.  Which has
been both good and bad.  Good because it gets me through and has been fun to
run with other people... bad because they're so fast I almost don't learn
anything.  heh.

I also spent 4 hours of Data Entry time at work today streaming Netfix on it
(Original Star Trek series if anyone cares) without a hitch.  I think I'm going
to get a lot of use out of this device.

RO should keep me busy until EDF 2017 Portable comes out.  Then all bets are
off.

Borderlands 2>
I just learned the hard way that you should always do side missions before
story missions.  I did the story mission for Opportunity and now the other
missions there are closed off to me.  Now it really feels like I'm behind on
levels and will probably just need to go shoot random stuff to get caught up.
The good news is that I have found some pretty decent weapons now and have been
making progress.. it seems like weapon level is more important than the other
weapon stats.  Thanks for the tip there.

I find myself wandering away and back to this game.. not like BL1 where I would
just look forward to playing it every evening.  I may take another break now
and jump back into Oblivion.  Would still like to get as much out of it before
starting Skyrim since I'm pretty sure I'll never end up going back.

I went ahead and uninstalled the MMO betas I was in--Mechwarrior and Planetside
2.  Just no real interest in either.  Still keeping around APB and SWTOR "just
in case" but haven't had much interest in those lately either.  It's been all
about the single player/LAN games here.

I'll have to check again, but it put them under a new category on the mission
list and they're no longer inaccessible.  I can't imagine they'd be too easy..
still around the same as my current level (24).  Not to mention Opportunity is
really freakin' hard for my character.. I barely made it through the story
mission.  And from the sound of the upcoming missions, it only gets more
difficult from here on out.

I still get some decent XP just by killing bad guys and running over mobs in
vehicles in some areas.  Was thinking I could try and get at least a couple
more levels that way before proceeding.  I only have access to one other area
with missions and they're "moderate"ly difficult, just as Opportunity was
supposed to be.

Never hurts to kill mobs, especially if you are getting good xp.  Side missions
are good for keeping your levels up and even getting some OK gear if you are
doing them at or very near your current level.

I found in BL2 that doing things at your level was more difficult than BL.  Not
impossible, but certainly more difficult.  Almost as if they really want you to
be playing online more rather than soloing.

The last time I was on I was trying to solo the final boss on Playthrough 2...
they patch a cheap way to do it.  Now you actually have to go fight the thing.
I don't know if my gear is up to it...   Ahh the joys of hunting for new
weapons.  Alas, new distractions...

I haven't been on BL2 for a while. But I always seem to end up back on Pandora.

Just because Sony patents it, doesn't mean it is going to be implemented.  I
would have to agree that the first company that attempts it is going to have a
big fat flop on their hands.  I could be wrong, it happens.  I just don't see
that even the less 'hardcore' gamer being happy about this.

You can't take your disc over to a friends house and play?  Instead you have to
drag your whole system?  You can't loan a friend a game, or borrow one of
theirs -- especially if it is one you've been fence sitting on?  No rentals.
What about multiple systems in the same house?

Even if every game had a demo, and every one of them won't, that won't help.
Demos often don't really let the player experience the true game.  I find they
often do more harm than good.

And much, much more.  I suspect if Sony does go down this path for te PS4
(which was talked about months ago for both MS and Sony and denied by both of
them) they'll be sitting on warehouses full of unsold systems.

was rumored to be implemented on the PS3. Not only did that turn out to be
false, but also the PS3 ended up being the first console without region-locked
games. (Unless the360 also lacks the region control? Not sure about that one)

And as M Bison says, whoever implements that shit will end up losing the
console wars. The one thing that we almost got screwed with on consoles (the
always-online DRM stuff) fortunately got axed thanks to the PSN outage. So
maybe Sony inadvertently saved us from that one?

So I acquired a DIMM board for the Naomi 2 setup, it has hacked firmware and a
custom CF card reader that plugs into it in place of the GD-Rom drive. You
could theoretically load up Naomi 1/2 games on the CF card and play them on the
system. Theoretically, yup.

It's crazy cool all the hackery that goes on with game stuff.

With the Neo Geo X being "cracked", I'm really curious what kind of unit I
have, if it's one with the games/bios on the little microSD card or if it's the
revision with the chip that's soldered to the board. I guess it was a revision
just to prevent the hackery, but the fact that there's two versions of the Neo
Geo X handheld is annoying. Well, only because I don't know what version I

Again, a patent does not mean implementation of said tech.

I would think price points would have to come down for somehting you couldn't
resell.  PSN does sell a lot of things for $10-$20.  I would argue that most of
them aren't as fleshed out as most of the $60 retail titles.  Or they've
finally been around long enough to warrant a price drop.

As for the phone comparison -- check out that $1 price tag... sure you get it
on some things.  But what about ports of bigger names.  Aren't you looking at
$10-$20?  I dunno, I don't play squat on my phone.  I haven't even loaded the
Sudoku app in months.  Even if it had the games I wanted to play, I don't much
care for playing them on a phone.  I'm sure the general public plays a lot more
on their phones than I do.  So apparently it works, but how many of those $1
games are more than a quick diversion?

I seriously doubt Sony will attempt to implement it.  There are just too many
reasons NOT to do it.  At least that's the way I see it.  But then Sony has
made some amazingly stupid decisions in the last few years....

Maybe I'll have to be content with what I've already got.

Remember, back then, the EU Court of Justice ruled that consumers are allowed
to sell on their games (well, not just games, but other software licences as
well), whether it's a hard copy version, or a digital version. I am sure that
there are a whole bunch of lawyers from all the game companies and everything
else fighting that ruling, but at the moment... What Sony got patented is
probably going to be in breach of the EU's ruling if they tried to implement

popping up from the rabbit hole in Far Cry 3.  so bright outside...

i am nearing the end of the missions, so i'm squeezing dry most of the major
side activities, filling out my skill trees, and getting every weapon
possible.  i am down to one more radio tower and three more bases, with some
hunting quests to go and a few blue exclamation points to hit up, so a few
more days and i'll pretty much have squeezed the game dry.  and with the z93
sniper rifle, plus my newly learned trick of shooting the alarm boxes, bases
are getting easier to take undetected for the extra xp.

unfortunately, there really aren't side quests like fallout, they're usually
very short with no story.  kill these dudes, kill that bear, etc.
fortunately, the gameplay is so sweet i just need excuses to go kill things.

the main questline remains very well done, with some exceedingly creative
sequences.  still, it would be nice to get some DLC for this game, and not
just something that adds 2-3 hours.

if nothing else, i'm tempted to play through the sucker again on a harder
difficulty, to force me to get better at stealth.  this really is one of the
best stealth games i've played in some time.  the AI isn't especially great,
but it's a challenge and the variety in takedowns is outstanding.  not to
mention that they are satisfying in a very visceral, grisly manner;)

i am liking persona 4 arena (and feeling very disappointed with dead or alive
5, but i should have known better), but without a doubt, far cry 3 is the
game that made my christmas.  for $40 (gotta love those post-Christmas deals
at Target), it is an absolute steal.

For those of you wanting more space simulation "roguelike" games, and are
looking for them on the cheap, FTL is currently priced at US$ 4.99.

(Disclaimer: I have not got this, but the reviews I've read of this, and the
youtube clips I've seen of it, is making me go "me want!" *heh* Unfortunately,
I've only got a netbook now, which won't play games, even simple games like
that... (I did have a laptop, but it gave up the ghost))

  It's now $9.99 on Steam and $10 on FTL website.  So guess I missed the sale.
For $2.50 or maybe $4.99 I might be tempted to buy it.  Looks kind of fun,
though still wishing there was a really good Space Sim along the lines of
Terminus, but much bigger play area and factions and races...

  I have one or two of the X series.  X-Beyond the Frontier I think is the last
one I have.  Terminus would be amazing if the world zone was so much bigger.  X
was kind of too involved with building and owning space stations and stuff.  I
never got them to properly work.  I just like you and your ship taking on
whatever you wanted.

  FTL - The one draw for me with this game is the fact you can name your crew.
Putting friends names in there just makes it silly fun, sort of like the Oregon
Trail game.  In fact this sort of reminds me of that game, just a space version
and a little more indepth...

The best elite-type modern game I've come across is Freelancer.  I've already
played the hell out of it, but there's still a pretty solid following and even
some dedicated servers for multiplayer out there.

IIRC, it doesn't play on Windows 7 without a certain mod which takes out the
single player campaign (bad) and introduces some neat new ships (good).

Everyone says the last level is super-hard.  I don't think I'll ever get that

played the game in beta (funded the kickstarter) and all of the ships and races

Wow. I didn't know that pinball was related to gambling.
BTW, it would be interesting to see the current market over here. There are a
lot of "games of chance" type machines in small "tienditas" (mini-shops), very
popular especially in poor areas. They give out cash prizes, some of them are
outright gambling like a digital roulette one.

Heh, those are actual gambling machines, unlike the pinball machines that were
banned. And it seems that demonizing videogames isn't new either, the pinball
demonizing looks mighty similar to the current videogame demonization...

  We have two places here in Denver called 1UP and 2UP.  Both are owned by the
same person and both downtown.  It's a fairly big arcade with a bar.  So over
21 only and unlike Dave and Busters, it's actually more like fun bar feeling
with adults and pretty much most of the old games/pinball you played in the
70's and 80's.  And they all cost the same.  A quater (or .50 for pinball). 
They even have a quarter dispenser machine that you have to use to get your
quarters (if you didn't bring your own).

  So much fun, and some of the 4 player games it's always fun to get a random
girl walking by to join in if you need an extra player.  Plus beer is actually
not that expensive either and the place is always filled.  Thanks, now I need
to plan to go back there again soon...

Arcades are basically gambling halls.  Pinball machines can be tuned to bounce
and create % tendencies on success/failure.  Conventional arcade games can be
set anywhere from 5-10 levels of difficulty, affecting $$$ take.  I remember
watching arcade operators setting a brand new machine to the hardest difficulty
level, to maximize $$$ intake (new novelty, active audience, short play times).
And then watching them set the difficultly level lower and lower as the number
of quarter depositors went down.  (I frequented a few arcades early in the
morning when they opened up since I had early classes in college).

does anybody have any insight into this "remove modes" trend among japanese
fighting games?

i've played team battle for years on tekken and dead or alive.  now tekken
doesn't allow you to adjust how many opponents you face, so it's always 7 vs.
7 or 3 vs. 3, no taking on 8 guys with just 2 or anything like that.  now i
have dead or alive 5 and team battle is just gone.  i think it's gone on soul
calibur V too, though i've already gotten a bit bored with that game.

it's the simplest thing...you can't tell me it can't be done with a few bits
of code, it's nothing new, just an arrangement of matches.  and yet while i
have the opportunity to double the cost of the game (or more) trying to buy
the costumes, i can't even buy team battle if i wanted to drop cash on it.

seriously, what the fuck is wrong with these japanese developers?  have they
crossed the boundary between inscrutability and insanity?

In the original, you can build and play a given level almost indefinitely, and
only when YOU are ready do you get to basically say "OK - ULTIMATE SHOWDOWN -
FIGHT!"

In the DS version, the computer decided when you were doing that.  Huge
difference IMO.

*sigh*  I pretty much wore Far Cry 3 out.  Did as much on the island as I
could to give myself some fun challenges, then beat the story.  Gonna reload
and beat it again to see the other ending sometime, but there's pretty much
no one left to kill otherwise.  they really need to throw in some DLC, and
consider enabling enemy bases to regenerate.  i might consider running
through it on hard, but i will probably move on.

it would have been nice if there'd been more side missions that made it a
little closer to fallout or skyrim in scope.  then again, i pretty much don't
play skyrim because there's too much to do, so things can go too far the
other way.


played most of the dead or alive 5 story mode, have all the characters except
pai (yes, from virtua fighter, they also have sarah and akira).  the story
mode has made me feel a little better about not having individual endings,
but for WHAT THE FUCK you can't beat the removal of team battle.

yep, i can spend sixty dollars or more on costumes, which DOA used to provide
for free, but no amount of money will get me team battle back, which was
always free and can't amount to more than a few lines of code, relatively
speaking.  and it was the primary way i played fighting games.

what the fuck is up with japanese developers gimping their single player
modes?  soul calibur V is a joke, and even tekken 6 removed the ability to
set the size of each team.  no more 3 vs. 8, i must now play 3 vs. 3 or 8 vs.
8.  OF FUCKING COURSE.

it's not like they're saving money or time.  it's more like they're
vandalizing single player, pissing on it out of disrespect.  i feel as if
i've personally been told to fuck off.

i generally am willing to pay full price early for a quality fighting game.
$18 was all soul calibur V earned and paying $40 for DOA5 has me feeling a
little ass-raped.  that was a $20 title, period.

these are just problems that shouldn't exist.

Doubtful on both counts, mobile and consoles, for the very same reasons
mentioned in the article. Smartphones are shitty for games that actually
require a controller. Ever tried to play Duke3D on an iTouch? On the console
side, consoles are still selling and console games keep on selling as well.
Just ask my 16 y/o stepson if he'd switch our PS3 for an iPhone, the answer is
NO. We don't own PSP/PSVita or even a DS/3DS, but that's mostly for budgetary
reasons, not because we don't want one.

I'm under the impression that the perception of mobile games killing dedicated
platforms is more of an "old fart" perception: us 30+ or 40+ers who now have
the $$$ to buy whatever we want, but don't have the time anymore to say, play
GTA4 and get all the trophies/achievements. I've finished AC2, but there's no
way I'm going to do the 200 feather search quest, I don't have that much time
on me.

So of course, to this "older gamer" market, the appeal of only buying $1 games
like Angry Birds is more appealing. But the kids actually playing games? Not so
much.

all over the instance before killing him (Bucket List), and it took almost his
entire rage timer to get him drug around.

Helped some guildies do toc10 for some transmog stuff, it was hilarious how
fast everything died. But at leat i got a couple old achievements out of it.

of 35% give or take..
- The stats on the item scale with your level.. so they don't become a big
liability in your gear as you level up

  I have one of each class.

72 hours

  I haven't done that, I haven't confirmed it, but there's a thread on wow
  forums saying people have gotten to level 85 in 72 hours (3 days) played
  time.

  Having your guildies run you thru stuff (kills your per monster XP, but
  then you can turn in quests for lots of XP) helps.

Heirlooms

  Lvl 80/85 chars buy and send to their lower toons:
  Back 5%
  Chest 10%
  Ring 5% (I dont' think this was added to the game, but it shows up in wowhead
  Head 10%
  Legs 10%
  Shoulder 10%

If you haven't played in a 'few years' it is *much* faster to level now. To add
to what has been said, you can also get XP in battlegrounds. And if you belong
to a leveled up guild, you get extra XP (I forget the %). And even just
questing gives XP faster than it used to. I would guess the 72 hours is play
time, not calendar time, but it is much faster now.

Love it... it is a great game a lot more difficult than I thought it would be
but that really has just added to it.

MOP--
After the Bs i have gone through with Diablo 3 and WoW (got banned had a lawyer
reqeust the info and there was nothing pinpointing the ban) Either way don't
really care. Just got tired of the grind and the people. I have 4 85's didn't
really enjoy the end game. MOP from what I saw in beta was less than impressive
though I saw on reddit MOP is like a turdsplosion of awful... i didn't think it
was that bad just not worth 40 bux plus 15 a month to play i would rather buy
an arduino and program it to yell for the horde everytime my kid yells :)

I, on the other hand, think everything I have seen so far of MoP (deep in the

would rank this expansion just hair below Burning Crusade in Quality and
definitely above Lich King.

Guild Wars 2 has indeed been a lot of fun, with a great difficulty curve.
Running dungeons for the first time with folks I was reminded of how our old
scholo and strat runs went in ISCA, before we really knew what we were doing.
It's a much different game, and they've done a great job of changing group
dynamics.

A fair number of the Dynamic Events in the later zones are kinda buggy still,
so that is a minus, but thus far it has just been a ton of fun. With no
appreciable gear progression to get at this point, the game is all about
achievements and looks. We'll see if that keeps people playing at 80. Some of
the 'better' gear can take quite a bit of effort to aquire, so you might really
have that old 'What I am wearing is rare' effect for a while.

  Hell, WoW introduced 'cross realm zones' so that places that used to be
  dead/empty are now filled with people from other realms. You can talk,
  quest, trade conjoured items.
  However, there are some "bugs", like zones that have timers: wintergrasp,
  other PvP zones...get VERY confused. heh.

Ultimately, however, it's a hack to avoid having to consolidate and shut down

appearance that the game is failing.

actually I think its more to do with the fact that they don't want to deal with
the hassle of forcing realm mergers.  Free character transfers are all
voluntary so if you decide to transfer you know the consequences.  Forced realm
mergers are a nightmare of trying to get even the simplest things like guild

Not to mention, there's going to be an influx on Sept 25 when MOP comes out. 
I've been surprised; three of us went away during Lich King, but one of us is
coming back for MoP.  The one remaining person is leaving MoP, but we suspect
that he will be back.  At the end of the day, there really isn't anything out
there like WoW.  I miss the communal/social aspect of WoW.  Every time I play a
single player game, there's a part of me that wishes I could be doing whatever
it is with another person.  That's something that even League of Legends
doesn't really quench since the games are so short and you never interact with
the same people again.  If I could burn time like I did in the past, I'd jump
right back into WoW.

up when you set JPEG quality to 10 or use TGA instead.  Not sure why Blizzard
would go to the trouble of implementing tracking code in the images if you can
simply disable it by setting your screen shots to highest quality or a
different format.  How does that make sense?

More likely, if there really is any tracking code there, it was for internal
use.  But I still have my doubts that that's what we're seeing in the samples

Now it's Mechwarrior Online.  They sent an email meant only for closed beta

access.  Damn it all to hell.  Now I have this one downloaded and updated as

You can start playing the trial, which allows you to play up to level 15, now.
Just go to www.swtor.com/free.  This isn't really an option for me since I've
already purchased the game and have a character.. I'm not going to pay for it
again (even if it is only $20 now) and skip playing my old character.

The real, actual F2P apparently starts this November, at least according to
G4TV.  Bioware hasn't included an official date (just "coming this Fall") yet
on the SWTOR website.  I'm keeping a close eye on it and will probably mention
it here when I jump back in.

Pretty sure Blizzard is referring to active paying accounts when it uses the
term "subscribers". If it included inactive accounts, the number would likely
be at least a few million higher since they claimed 11M+ at one point.

boring yes. But really once you get enough gear to do LFR you don't HAVE to do
dailies unless you want to get gear faster.

  With CSR (cross server realms) the population would seem same or bigger.
  Servers that were empty (even cities i hear) are now populated from other
  realms so "everything" (nearly?) seems alive.
  Note: I haven't tried my 10 day free trial and I haven't played for a year+
  so this is based on reading Wow Insider daily, not from personal experience.

  Plus, when MoP released, the numbers went up by a million or so.

I think my primary realm has at least as many if not more players. And the
cities are definitely more occupied. I am not sure that is due to cross-realm
though, as from what I understand there are limited areas or situations where
you actually show up on the 'foreign' server. I may be wrong on that, but I
would expect the capital cities to be unbearably crowded if it were so.

Like Cerebus, I think the changes give you way more to do than any sane person
has time to commit to it. You can just focus on one area e.g. battleground,
raids, dailies, questing, etc. and you have plenty to do. And they have mixed
it up on the dailies so it is a subset of quests drawn from a pool, making it
somewhat more bearable. Old dungeons are also a lot of fun, though I actually
enjoyed that even before recent changes that made some of them possible now.
But unless you want the very best gear, it is less demanding and easier to play
more casually. My only serious complaint is that my 3-year old computer, which
was not high-end to begin with, forces me to play at relatively low res. :-(

  Throughout the entire game. Yes, competition for mining/herbs. and they just
  lowered the respawn rate for herbs/mining (high end mats at least).
  If your server is high population, and you're in a highly populated
  area with people from your server, you won't see cross realm toons.
  They only show up when its much more empty.
  Say you're leveling your new monk and you're level 50...and you have a
  group quest, but no one on your server is lvl 50 and logged in. CSR will
  populate the zone with other toons from other servers so you have someone
  to group with. Its similar to LFG in the fact you can't trade stuff with
  them (other than mage water, etc) but helps make it feel alive.

  Looks like I using the wrong term: CRZ: Cross Realm Zones.

  Oh ok, that's different then.  I just recall it when it was just the LFG in
5 mans and stuff, but not in zones.  Guess it makes it easier of course to do
those group quests, at the cost of competing with mobs and individual quests. 
So it's not like a merge of realms then.  Just a temporary merge when the zone
is not as populated.  Got it...

later and some new gear and I do much better with that... amazing how much 2

My miner had a crap ton of cobalt and I couldn't figure out why.  I got on my

I hadn't seen anything about getting less experience.  About the biggest
obstacle I've run into is that when they allow you to pick a mission reward you
can't get a lockbox.  I always get commendations instead anyway so no big deal.

I was under the impression that F2P limited you on flashpoints but I got into
one of those fine (I was prepared to use cartel coins if necessary).

Looking back at the feature chart, it looks like they limit you on a lot of
shit.  Yet I've accessed a flashpoint, chat, mail and my bank since starting
F2P without issue.  Maybe my account somehow has elevated rights since I didn't
start this character during F2P..?

I had been doing TOR until this 10-day thing.  The F2P is really limited, but
playable.  You get 2 character slots.  Period.  Even if you go premium or
whatever they call it, you get 2 character slots.  If you subscribe you get
like 16.  Kind of absurd.

Chat for fp2 is like one message ever 60 seconds or something.  Hard to carry
on a conversation.

I don't mind that they want you to buy more inventory space, and things like
that.  Even not getting rested XP doesn't bother me.  But if they actually cut
your XP from the norm... that's just lame.

While I haven't been on in ages -- I did like how LotRO lets you earn turbine
points.  Sure, buying them is faster (and I have).  But if you really wanted
to, you could unlock the entire game, expansions and all, but playing for free.
 It would take forever and frankly wouldn't be worth that -- but it is doable.

What I'm seeing from TOR is that is a lot closer to pay-to-win.  Heck, as a f2p
you can't even equip certain higher level items unless you unlock that with
cartel coins.

I've had fun running around in WoW again.  I did find out last night that while
I have access to Pandaria, they wouldn't let me level to 86.  I'm 1xp away.  I
suspect it is because I haven't bought it so if I ever resubbed without buying
Mists I'd be beyond the level max for what I'd paid for.  That being said, I
have been really enjoying the content.  It certainly was better than Cata I
think.

I got to play a Panda Monk which was fun.  Got to 20 and bought myself a Turtle
mount.

Generally it's just been fun to be back in the World of Warcraft.  I'd love to
resub, but there is just no way I could get away with it without causing

TSW to me seemed like it would have made a great single-player RPG.

WoW CRZ> Just to clear up some confusion: people on PvP servers will only cross
zone into other PvP servers, same with PvE. They also keep the RP and Non-RP
peeps separate. One easy way to tell that you're being CRZ'ed is that you're
on a server in a different time zone if you have the system time displayed. Ove
r the last couple of months, I've noticed certain areas have become absolute
bloodbaths with World PvP on my PvP realm, especially Hellfire. I was leveling
my 90's mining there and apparently many other 90's were there just to give
people a difficult time leveling.

Also they claim the cities don't get CRZ'ed yet it happened to me once in
Silvermoon City. Granted, that city is a ghost town normally. Perhaps it was an
error or they were testing the idea. I don't recall what if anything that did
to trade chat.

Guess I don't really need any more info.  Somwhere along the line I missed that
Funcom actually expects you to buy the game still.  No monthly fee, granted,
but they expect that $30 to play at all.

Not unheard of (GW2 -- but then GW2 never had a subscription) I grant.  Still,
not exactly the f2p I was thinking.

There is SWTOR and LotRO and all the other stuff I've got I never make time to
play already.  TSW can remain unplayed.

I've been in all the other cities and they have CRZ, but those two cities are

Also Pandaria is not on the CRZ list, so when you are out in the Panda areas
you should only see people from your realm (which makes sense, since the whole
point was to get areas to "X" population)

It does make levelling on a PVP server even worse from what I've heard.  Since

Sorry I didn't log in for a bit, and missed your question. If you ever DO pick
up secret world, the key is choosing weapons / abilities that have good
synergy. There's a LOT of different ways to do that, but choose a couple of
stats or effects, and work your way up through trees to get abilities that make
those things better regardless of which weapon they are in.

ANd if you don't mind building slower, you can always re-run missions in lower
level zones over and over for more AP to buy up different trees as well. One
character can eventually have all the skills and abilities (Though I haven't
gotten anywhere close to that.)

It's just easy to say 'Ohh, I like pistols and hammers', and make a
pistols/hammer build, and not pay any attention to what stats/effects pistols
abilities add on, and which stat/effects hammer abilities add on, and buy a
bunch of things that are alrigjht by themselves, but do not synergize well.
That works OK at first, but not later. If you do something like that, then you
DO have to go back and do lower zones for a bit to rework things, or slog your
way through the higher level zones at a much slower/harder pace.

Compared to the Ruby exploit, the Java exploit is pretty ho-hum.  AFAIU, a
user has to visit a rogue site with plugins automatically enabled (duh!). The
rogue server sends a bad applet. (Exploiting java reflection.) Enterprise
servers that use Java are not vulnerable to incoming attacks.

In the Ruby exploit, anyone can 0wn a Ruby on Rails server by sending a rogue
POST request. (Exploiting HTTP headers, XML, YAML, and some Rails string
conventions.)

The real culprit here is text-based protocols. Any model which allows or
encourages programmers to carve up strings or use strings as non-atomic data
collections is a security anti-pattern. Clearly, programmers are unable to
manage strings safely. It's apparently too complicated.

I discovered an interesting thing about how Perl implements closures.

    sub alloc_a_shitton {
        my $i = 0;
        my @data = map {'x' x $mb } (1..400);  ## 400 strings, 1 MB in length.

        return (0==int rand 1_000_000)
            ? sub { ++$i; $data[0]=1 }           ## Captures the beast.
            : sub { ++$i }                       ## Captures tiny amount.
    }

    my $f = alloc_a_shitton ();
    ## Inspect memory here.

At compile-time, we consuder both lexicals ($i and @data) to be captured.
This means they cannot exist solely on the call stack and must be placed into
the closure environment. But at runtime, we know there is a 1 in a million
chance of the data actually being captured. What happens to memory we run this
code? It's easy to watch in `top`. The data is allocated and memory spikes to
about 1GB, then it is immediately discarded. It is not held by $f, even though
$f holds a closure.  If we instead change the probability to 1, then the first
closure is returned, memory is NOT discarded, as expected, because it still is
accessible via $f. So that's pretty cool. The lexical appears only to be truly
captured at runtime.  I'm curious what other languages do this.

(I did my best to subvert common closure optimizations. For example, the
lexicals are modified, i.e., not read-only, to avoid "by-value" capturing.)

imagine that I could modify EMC's management applet (Navisphere IIRC?) and put
it in their upgrade cd (maybe befriend a consultant or even email it to

I'm thinking of asking for half-height cube walls and two walled-off rooms for
group work.

Any thoughts?

  Open spaces/low walls are great for collabo, but HORRIBLE for conf calls.
  How many concurrent conf calls will you have? if just 2, then your
  two walled off rooms will be enough for them to leave the floor and
  go off so they can talk and be heard and hear the other side.
  If the rooms are also for group work and you might have 3 things happening
  at once, then you might need more separated areas.

We just (like, yesterday) leased new office space. 18 offices and 8 pods; each
pod is a 6' wall enclosing an area larger than an office, with an opening
in the middle of one side. It was designed for four people per pod; prior
tenants had three.  We'll have two.

There will be one standing office that will also double as a lactation room,
should it be needed (it has, off and on, over the years). If y'all can think
of anything better to do with the space, please let me know. I'll be
interested to see how the pairs lay out their space; they have their own
furniture budget, and about 1/3 of the office has moved to desks which can
toggle between standing and sitting.

Our new offices have walls that just go to the suspended ceiling and uses a
plenum return (ick). Our current building has walls, in places, that are:
     [][]X[] []X[][]
where "X" is a 2-4 and "[]" is a 3/8th inch drywall.  Yes, six sheets of
drywall and a dead 2" airspace between some of the offices (most notably,
mine and the conference room).

I'm going to miss working in an ex radio station.

We have a few collaborative areas...for 15 people we'd probably do something
like three teams of five. And the five people would have all their desks pused
up back-to-back.  For conference calls we'd use a meeting room.  For personal
shit everyone just uses their cell phone and goes to an unused office or
outside or something.

Here's a picture of a space next to where I sit where a bunch of people just
moved out of this morning:

Question for y'all about function/method overloading. Specifically, when the
same identifier "f" might resolve to multiple different declarations. The
simplest psuedo-code example is based on scope and/or number of parameters:

    function f (x) { }

    function g () {
        var f = function() { };      // Does this f shadow the outer f?
        f(1);                        // or does it overload it?
    }

    function f (x,y) { }             // overload based on number of params?

So the question is do you prefer strict shadowing or overloading, and why?

It's not so much that the programmers in China were great, but that in large
enterprise environments (like Verizon), the quality of work is terrible.  In
those environments, connections/seniority/politics are core skills, but
technical skill is non-existent.  Having been in government and enterprise (and
working as a consultant now for enterprise), the technical bar is ridiculously
low (but the pay is incredibly high).

He's in a state of denial. High performance belongs to C++ now.  We'd be using
C if it were faster because there's no technical barrier to switching between
C and C++ -- C++ experts are already C experts. Every major C compiler is also
a C++ compiler, and every major platform supports C++.

Today, the only barrier to upgrading to C++ is stubborn C programmers and the
old myths they tell themselves.

The mistake most people make when trying to convince C programmers of the
Aw3s0m3neSS of C++ is to focus on OO and generics. But C programmers don't
give a rat's ass about OO or generics! C programmers think OO means structs
with function pointers, generics means cast to void*, and anything else is
just overhead.  C programmers have decided that C is the perfect level between
high-level and low-level, for all time, and refuse to accept the reality that
you can get even more high-level without sacrificing performance.  The only
way to convince them is to show them directly.

All you have to do to persuade (open-minded) C programmers to switch to C++ is
to show them how to replace 1000's of lines of their custom C hash tables,
trees, lists, growable arrays, and char* libraries with the C++ standard
containers and algorithms, *AND* show them the generated assembly
side-by-side, along with performance timings; they'll start salivating.


(Btw, that guy's street cred with C++ is MySQL. That's good developer cred,
but not so good C++ cred. MySQL's style of C++ is the 20-year old kind of C++.
It uses classes for basic encapsulation, but nothing else.  There's no OO to
speak of in MySQL. And it doesn't use any of the standard stuff, not even
strings. It looks like someone jammed C code into class methods and called it
a day.)

Your parenthetical paragraph is one of the complaints I've heard about C++:
that it changes too much over time.  You can get a pretty good idea within
a few years when C++ was written depending on their use of STL, functional
programming, or RAII.

Not that I care.  I use C and C++ almost interchangeably.  My current
place prefers C over C++ but I managed to sneak in one small C++ project.
Mostly because I find the OpenBSD macros for data types to be an

Ha! That's pretty funny because C++ developers complain that it doesn't change
fast enough, and is dragged down by the snail's pace of the standards
committee.  Compared to other languages, the pace of new features in C++ is
painful.  For example, C++ only recently got regular expressions, tuples, and
closures (officially, that is). And the committee couldn't agree on an
official garbage collection model so they delayed GC until the next standard.
The only language that moves slower than C++ is C. ;)

Nah. There's no such thing as an experienced C++11 developer because C++11
features have only been available in compilers for a year or so. Boost is a
large collection of often unrelated libs. There's no way to "use boost" as a
whole. I've probably never used about half of boost, but I use the other half
daily. Lambdas: I could give a two-minute tutorial on lambdas and you'd know
everything.

TWO-MINUTE INTRO TO C++ LAMBDAS
-------------------------------

    []{block} means create a lambda. A lambda is an INLINE ANONYMOUS FUNCTION.
              A lambda is also a CLOSURE if it captures variables.

You can specify arguments to the lambda, but you don't have to,

    [](int x, int y){ return x+y; }

You can tell it to capture variables with [&] or [=],

    [&]{ return x+y; }       // capture by everything reference.
    [=]{ return x+y; }       // capture by everything value.

You can specify which variables to capture by reference and which by value,

    [x,&y]{ return x+y; }    // x by value, y by reference.

The `this` pointer is automatically captured, just like other variables,

    [=]{ call_a_method(); }  // implicitly captures `this`

You must specify the return type unless it is void or the body is a
single `return` statement.

    [](int x, int y) -> int { int z = x+y; return z; }

The TYPE of the closure itself is compatible with std::function,

    function<int()> f = [&]{ return x+y; };

but there's no need for that since `auto` is simpler,

    auto f = [&]{ return x+y; };        // same as above.

A final note: C++11 lambdas are very different from the boost::lambda library.
The boost::lambda library is more cryptic and was designed for C++03.
boost::lambda is made (mostly) obsolete by C++11 lamda syntax.

Smoke Eater> Three ways to use lambdas:

    1. Classic: inline code snippets that would otherwise have to be separated
       into a named "helper" function. The benefit is that the code is in
       one place. It's not much of benefit since the old way wasn't too
       terrible, and the syntax is the opposite of clean.

       for_each (begin(v), end(v), [](Obj& o){ o.whatever(); });     // yuk.

    2. Frameworks: such as the ever-popular MVC are based on plugging in
       "callbacks" to various framework slots.

           // framework API
           typedef function<void(Event&)> Handler;
           void register_listener (Handler);

           // user code
           register_listener ([](Event& e){ if(e.key == 'q') quit(); });

    3. Clever Syntax: many standard utilities such as std::async take a
       `callable` object. Lambdas give the appearance of block syntax,

            async ([]{                // run code in parallel.
                while (blah)
                    do_whatever ();
            });

            thread {                  // same thing. (almost).

Faunus> Yes. However the lines are blurry in C++ where generics are not a
single function to be called, but instead a kind of incomplete function that
you need to "fill in" by specifying the remaining components. The for_each
example I posted doesn't really "call" anything. It inlines your lambda to
form a complete function.

(Btw, my for_each example was bad. Nobody would write that in practice because
for_each is just a dumb loop. For that you'd write,
    for (auto o : v)
        o.do_something();
A better example would have been something more interesting like sort())

> So C++ mastery presumes mastery of C, in general.

Yeah, pretty much. It's probably hard to grok the relationship between C and
C++ because there's nothing else like it. Basically, C++ is built on top of C.
Every C program is a valid C++ program (there are a few edge cases).  They're
not only source compatible, they're *binary* compatible. You can link C and
C++ libraries together seemlessly. C++ was deliberately designed this way.  If
C is a set of sharp knives, C++ is everything but the kitchen sink! :)

> people should learn C++ first, and then, if at all, learn C.

I don't think people should learn either language unless they have a real
reason to.  Both languages are complicated. Neither is a toy, and neither are
good choices if you simply want to get exposure to a specific paradigm, like
OO or whatever. They are both unforgiving of mistakes. I mean, we have to be
honest -- there's a reason Java is so successful.

I would say learn C if you want to hack GNU/linux stuff, write device drivers,
and very low-level embedded stuff (i.e., micro controllers that don't already
support Java!)  Learn C++ for similar reasons that you would learn Java, Perl,
..NET, etc.: you want to augment your general skills as a developer with a
modern practical language, one you intend to use.

So in short: I'm not a C++ advocate. It's a complicated brutal language. But
it's the only language out there that can do what it does. It's not best in
class, it's ONLY in class. If you need it, you know it already.  C++ isn't
fun. Go learn something fun. :)

has to know a thing about unicode. All text is unicode, and there is no way to
use anything but unicode. There is no special mode to enable unicode and no
special syntax to select unicode. If done correctly, the words "unicode" and
"UTF" will never be mentioned. They will be assumed, just like we assume

That's not really what GC provides, though. GC manages object lifetimes.
Memory management is orthogonal to GC.  Look at Java, the poster-child for GC.
Java's memory manager is infamously terrible, a bloated pig that even Java
devotees bemoan. But Java's GC is well-respected, mature and is credited with
renewing interest in GC in general as a practical research topic.

users.find_all do |user|

end

or more tersely

user.find_all{ |_| _.session_expired }.each{ |_| _.logout }

or even:

user.find_all(&:session_expired).each(&:logout)

In order to make that last one work I cheated and assumed from the
outset that session_expired and logout were both methods defined on
the class "users" belongs to.

Of course, in Ruby you have to go through a little rigmarole to
actually name the function that corresponds to the method on an
object.

In Javascript or Python,

foo.bar() is a method invocation and
foo.bar is the function that is invoked. *

Whereas in Ruby they're both method invocations, and you have to go
through some rigmarole if you want to actually talk about a method
as if it were a function.

The trick I used in that last line is the magical & operator, which if
which converts a symbol :foo into a function which takes an argument
and calls the "foo" method on that argument.**

(* I understand that there's an important difference there that I'm
glossing over, in that foo.bar in Python names the method *pre-bound
to the object foo* while in Javascript it isn't bound to anything in
particular.  I think.  I'm not so sure about Python; my python-fu is
weak, which is something I'd like to remedy someday)

(** actually it takes a variable number of arguments, calls the 'foo'
method of the first, and feeds in the rest as arguments to that method
call)

solve real world problems in languages like Haskell, Common LISP, or Scheme to
implement solutions to difficult problems in concurrency and other areas
considered to be hard or at least inelegant to implement in other languages.
It is gaining wider adoption in a number of large companies, and its user base
is growing quickly.

So what you're saying is because of Clojure's association with Java, it lures
frightened Java programmers over to Scheme, who otherwise wouldn't have left
their comfort zone. I can buy that.

It's kinda like how smug lisp weenies spent a couple decades raving on and on
about how "powerful" closures are. Programmers of the C-like languages
wouldn't hear of it.  Much later, when languages with C-like syntax
implemented closures (Perl, Javascript, etc.), those previously frightened
programmers became enamoured with closures.  It took an association with their
comfort zone to make them see something that had been in front of their face
all along, and in fact, that they had previously dismissed.

It's also luring Python/Ruby programmers to Scheme because they're finding out
that concurrency in their languages is hard, and by comparison, concurrency in
always immutable Clojure land is easy.

It's also enabling people who've known nothing but OO environments for the
entirety of their programming experience to appreciate what LISP programmers
have known for eons - that you can do polymorphism, composition, etc etc
without an object system.

 I think some clarifications are in order..

 Clojure is not a truly functional language. It is an imperative language with
 features to support the functional paradigm.

 Clojure's concurrency support is unrelated to FP. Its concurrency support is
 based on the programmer explicitly labeling which variables are mutable by
 threads and requiring the programmer to use a controlled messaging framework
 for IPC.

 Immutability of variables is not a defining characteristic of FP. It's just
 the part of FP that imperative programmers tend to focus on because it's the
 part of FP most easily simulated in imperative languages. Statically-typed
 languages support immutability quite naturally and safely with `const`
 mechanisms.  Dynamically typed languages, such as Clojure simulate
 immutability through runtime checks.

 Clojure is really nothing like Haskell.


> Python/Ruby programmers to Scheme because they're finding out that

 Dude. Clojure *is* Scheme. Racket has the same concurrency primitives.

> polymorphism, composition, etc etc without an object system.

 Of course you can. You can simulate any language feature you want with added
 runtime overhead and if you ask the programmer to squint hard enough. But
 it's still a simulation, not an actual feature.  For example, Scheme's
 `promises` are not the same thing as actual lazy evaluation. They are a
 simulation requiring the programmer to explicitly guide the simulator.

Been playing with Clojure's STM implementation. It's fascinating, but I'm
seeing strange results. How do I trace/observe the retries?  I used the
example code from wikipedia, reduced the number of vectors to 1 and  the
number of items to 2-10. This will create thread contention in the swap()
operation. I added an agent to count the attempts, and notified the agent from
within each thread.  However, I have yet to observe a retry. This is on an SMP
machine. I verified that Java does indeed use native threads, however I see
FEWER threads in the process table as than I launch from within Clojure.

I even tried placing a (Thread/sleep 10) IN BETWEEN the two ref assignments
within the synchronous block. This did increase running time by the amount
expected, but did not produce restarts.

This leads me to guess wildly at some possible explanations. The most obvious
is that my code is wrong and using an agent to count retries won't work.  But
now I'm somewhat curious whether the threading model is what it says it is.
For example, Clojure docs says each variable contains a default max limit of
10 possible values (one for each thread).  Perhaps there are other limits in
   force here too? Does Clojure perform locking/waiting internally?

The problem with Simon Green, if you consider it a problem, is that all of his
characters sound suspiciously alike. He's like Joss Whedon: almost all of their
characters have "TV Wit" - the kind of thing where even the dumbed and most
unlikely characters all have witty ripostes at hand, and as a result sound like
the author's voice, rather than being a character in their own right. So Owen
Deathstalker sounds like Taylor, who sounds like Edwin Drood. They all have
chaotic/violent girlfriends, who all kinda sound alike. The villains are all
witty and suave and have a comeback, or are amusing yet deadly psychos. And so
on, and so on, and so on.

Now if you like that kind of thing, and if the author can make th emajority of
his dialogue funn (depending on your sense of humor), then you're going to like
his books. If you don't, you won't.

like this.  It's very similar in a lot of ways, although personally I didn't
find it derivative, it's more like a companion piece.  There's even a reference
to Dresden in the first chapter.  It's set in London, and the main character is
a mage who's a seer.  His abilities are a lot less physical and a lot more
intelligence-based, so there's less smash and grab and more plot.  It's a
refreshing change from the usual good-guys-bad-guys-massive-battle formula.  I
liked it a lot better than Kevin Hearne's work.  The characters seemed well-
rounded and there's a lot less black and white and a lot more grey in terms of
good and bad.  The second novel is out in June, I think.

It is another wizard-with-a-dark-and-tragic-past-but-cynical-sense-of-humour

lately.  The magic system is interestingly different: it's based on summoning,
so the magic users do what they do by summoning objects and beings from other
places, and dispelling them again to said places.  It means they can't do
things to themselves, like make themselves fly or turn invisible - everything
they do has be caused by something summonable.  I thought it was definitely
worth a read, especially given the low price.  There are two sequels so far as
well.

Like most King stuff, I found it a page turner. So it's livelier than 11/22/63,
which I found interesting but not really a must-read/can't-put-down sorta book.

It's... a Dark Tower book. closer in tone to the first half than the second,
without the many-worlds and pop references (although two deputies are called
Strother and Pickens :( ). The framing modern-day story is adequate. The second
framing story of Roland and Jamie going on a mission against a skin-man has
some back story on Roland - The Early Days and wraps up a plot point or two
with Gabrielle. The third story is more of an Eyes of the Dragon kinda piece.

I'm sure I've read it. It's not "The Man." It's not in "The Martian Chronicles"

But really there are some wonderful things out there.  Lord of Light is among
his best, so if the next isn't quite up to snuff for you, please keep that in
mind.

Creature of Light and Darkness is interesting.  Using the Egyptian mythos.

Doorways in the Sand is a fun read -- a perpetual student (to keep mooching off
his Uncle) gets an otherworldly message.

I have been a fan of the Chronicles of Amber (found in one volume _The Great
Book of Amber_).  Very creative ideas.  The first 5 (Corwin's story) are
certainly better than the later (Merlin's story), but I think Merlin's was
tyring to plumb the depths of the universe and Corwin's was more of an
adventure.  Anyhow -- I love it, even though it is not perfect.

Damnation Alley -- post apocalyptic trip across America.  The shorter one is
better, but either way a good read.

Roadmarks -- A road with turnoffs to anytime, anywhere.

Dream Master (novelized form of "He Who Shapes") -- To help people, Charles
Render enters into and controls the dreams of his patients.

I always, always, always recommend his short fiction.  I love his novels
(mostly) but he admittedly wrote them because they were more financially viable
than the short story which is the form he loved best.  The common collectios of
these are:

Doors of his Face, the Lamps of his Mouth
Last Defender of Camelot
Unicorn Variations
Frost & Fire
Manna From Heaven

A couple/three years ago the New England Science Fiction Association published
6 volumes.  Every piece of short fiction of RZ's they could find.  For me they
were a must have.  There is some amazing stuff in them.  Though honestly, much
of that amazing stuff is found in the above collections.  These six are:

Threshold
Power & Light
This Mortal Mountain
Last Exit to Babylon
Nine Black Doves
Road to Amber

It may also be worth noting that these are the only works that have an official
Michael Whealan cover for RZ.

All of this being said -- nearly everything of Roger's is out of print.  A
library may have some of it.  The NESFA books are available (at $25-30 each).

Looks like some of them are available on that Ultimate Library:

The movie does start the fine tradition of actor Paul Winfield being attacked
by voracious insects (see also ST2: Wrath of Khan).

You can also see a very pre-pre Rorschach with Jackie Earle Haley.

The most disturbing thing is that they apparently borrowed pretty heavily from
it for Escape from New York. I wouldn't say Hell Tanner and Snake Pliskin are
identical, but there are a lot of similarities there...

Varies widely depending on the subgenre he's writing in.  The Laundry series
(my favorite :) is super geeky James Bond meets HP Lovecraft with a very techie
sensibility to the whole thing.

Halting State/Rule 45 are (again tech heavy) near future geo-political science
fiction with a heavy dose of the gamer gestalt.

All of his work that I've read is as I said very geeky.  Example -
'programming' zombies in something that looks very much like Python (If that
sounds cheesy to you, I'd urge you to give him a shot.  Unlike other writers
who fling tech around without having a clue as to whether it even remotely
makes sense, Stross comes from the tech industry and knows a thing or two).

I'd recommend starting with either The Atrocity Archives or Halting State.
Both are truly superb books IMO.

China is an author who perplexes me. I quite enjoy his writing, I quite enjoy
his ideas and his universe, but his characters annoy the piss out of me.

I also find his novels to be subconsciously sexist. The female characters, even
when they are the main character such as in the scar, are notoriously passive
and subject to repeated and continual abuses. I mean, the males may be subject
to emotional, psychological and socialogical challenges, but the physical abuse
is preserved very soundly for the female characters.

And there's also a pattern, as china seems, as an author, to be interested in
exploring the effects of the plot on the psyche of the characters rather than
the plot itself, of extremely slow moving middles. It can be a slog fest.

That all sounds very negative, but I do recommend the books for the spectacular
wordsmanship and the fascinating complex ideas behind the stories.

Gislef -- the New Dr Who (9th, 10th, 11th).  Not having read any of the

Meh, personally I enjoyed it through book 6... the battle of dumai's wells in
tnat book was a highlight.

THEN it went from quite a lot happening every book to 4 books in a row that
were like 700-1000 pages where NOTHING happened for 90+% of the novel.

You could easily fit every significant event from books 7, 8, 9, and 10 into
one book half the size of any of them.

By book 11 Jordan realized he was dying and it was back to getting shit moving
and actually being good again.


And the last 2 (12-part 1 and 12-part 2) by Sanderson have been excellent. 
Sanderson writes Jordan better than Jordan ever did.



Part of it though, especially for the pre-sanderson ones, is you have to learn
how to read the books.... Jordan is like Stephen King in that he'll spend 3
pages describing some minor item in excruciating detail... (as king might spend
3 pages describing the rock someone kicks down a road and how it bounces,
Jordan might spend as much time on the outfit Rand is wearing)... once you
learn how to skim those bits the books go much faster than there's some
worthwhile stuff to read :) (most of books 7-10 excluded :P)

I will say this though.  I stopped reading them around book 8 or 9 until last
year.  Reread the entire series from book 1 up through the latest Sanderson
book.  I really enjoyed the reread having had a long break from the series it
was almost like reading it again for the first time.  I had forgotten a lot so
much of it felt fresh again.  Also I've matured some so the slower stuff didn't
bore me quite so much.

I've heard Eye of the World was optioned for a movie, I'll be curious if that
actually makes it to the big screen how badly they butcher it and how
successful it ends up being.  I'm fearing another Eragon or Golden Compass
where it's a one-off movie.

Well... Eragon needed to be a one-off movie anyway.  As it is, Paolini should
be paying a whole lot to the estates of Anne McCafferey and JRR Tolkien; the
entire series is remarkably derivative of both, to the point of being copying
in many regards, and I have it on very good authority that the only reason
Paolini didn't get sued long ago was that McCafferey was such a sweet woman.

Speaking of Jordan *heh* my daughter is a big Sanderson fan.  Yesterday I think
it was she saw that the last Wheel fo Time book's final revisions, etc are
done.  She told me "This makes me incredibly happy, because now he can go back

I asked him how finishing WoT affected his own writing.  His first response

him develop the juggling of multiple plot lines.

I've managed to keep the re-reads down,because I've been catching up on some
stuff.  Backlist of writers I've come to recently, new books in series by
writers I've been reading for a while, a few new stand-alones (Redshirts, for
instance).  And the list keeps getting added to!  I just got a copy of Meagan
Spooner's _Skylark_ because the premise sounded interesting, among about a
dozen others, and a 4 book series from Laura Anne Gilman that I need to get my
hands on as well.  So they just keep coming out and piling up *heh*

And for that matter, speaking of Scalzi, his next project sounds intriguing as
well.  A serial novel, sort of episodic, where each one is a self-contained
story but the whole makes for an integrated story arc as well.  "The Human
Division" I think it's called.  The first episode is due out mid-December, and
the full novel version should be released next May or so.  I heard him talking
about it on Sword and Laser, which is kind of fun.

Character created by F. Paul Wilson. Although purportedly he had a more-or-less
normal childhood (which we find out later he didn't), Jack basically drops out
of society. He operates below the radar in New York and work as a "repairman,"
fixing problems for people that usually need some intervention against crime
types.

Assuming the first book mentioned above is The Tomb, Jack gets involved in the
search for a mystic medallion that grants the wearer immortality, and that
someone is seeking it using Hindu rakashi demons. The rakashi are also being
used to exact vengeance on a family in NYC as well. Jack gets hired to find the
medallion after muggers take it.

Jack is basically absolutely ruthless when it comes to protecting his own and
helping the innocent. he's an expert marksman and hand-to-hand fighter, mostly
self-taught, but also relies on his wits and often sets up the criminals he
goes after.

The character is a large part of F. Paul Wilson's The Adversary Cycle. Eve see
the movie The Keep, with Scott Glenn? That's part of the Adversary Cycle, and
Glenn's character appears in the later Repairman Jack books.

Basically Jack is tied with up a big bad that plans to transform Earth into a
wasteland on behalf of his master, a vague ominous multi-dimensional Adversary.
Oddly, we've already seen the end of the battle in Wilson's Nightworld, but
he's resissuing it with some major overhauling. Since he actually wrote it
before most of the Repairman Jack novels. Nightworld also ties together
characters from a bunch of Wilson's other stories.


If you're not reading F. Paul wilson in general, I'd recommend him. His
anthologies Aftershock and "The Barrens and Others" are pretty good. His short
story Pelts was adapted for Masters of Horror and I seem to recall he didn an
episode of Monsters.

At least one of them has a Repairman Jack short story in it, although it's a
mundane one: none of the Adversary stuff. And a lot of them are loosley tied
into Wilson's mythology. Since Wilson grew up in New Jersey, several of them
are connected to the New Jersey Barrens: "The Barrens" and "Pelts" both are.
And of course, it's where Jack grew up and has has had several brushes with
weirdness.

So I had never bothered with Brian Herbert/Kevin Anderson's "new" Dune books.
Sunday I was kicking around wanting something to read.  Wanted to take a break
from Lakoff's _Women Fire and Dangerous Things_ and didn't really want to grab
a fantasy.

So I was thinking one of the Robin Cook medical thrillers I've got sitting on
the shelf.  Then I remembered I got House Atreides, Harkonnen and Corrino from
TUEBL to try them finally.

I'm only about 40% into House Atreides, but I'm liking it.  Sure, it isn't
Frank Herbert, but it is interesting to see some of the backstory leading up to
_Dune_.

I'll tell you this for sure -- it is a hell of a lot better than that fetid
pile of dingos kidneys that John Gregory Betancourt was trying to sling as
prequels to Amber.  Thank goodness iBooks went under so we haven't been
subjected to a 5th one.  (I think I stopped after the first 2... maybe 3).

I just finished a good book: Rook, by Daniel O'Malley.

It starts intriguingly, with a character who's lost her memory and has nothing
to go on but some letters from her former self.  Turns out she works for a
top-secret government organisation that deals with supernatural events called
the Checquy, which has roles based loosely on chess pieces - hence she's a
rook.  There's a lot of snappy, witty dialogue (always a plus), a decent
mystery and several strong female characters (I am so tired of the cliche of a
tortured male fantasy lead with a slightly useless female apprentice/side-
kick).  There is a bit of information dump at the start, because the main
character has lost her memory so spends the first chunk of the book trying to
figure out what the hell is going on by reading letters and notes from her
predecessor, but it's fascinating stuff and once the action kicks in, it really
kicks in.

Plus, only 99p on Kindle :-)

"(I am so tired of the cliche of a tortured male fantasy lead with a slightly

Xenos, you must not be reading the right fantasy *heh*  Most of what I've been
reading lately is, if it fits that mold, rather the opposite.  If anything, the
somewhat useless sidekick (if there is one) is male, to the female lead,
tortured or otherwise.  Michelle (Sagara) West, Lisa Shearin, Lynn Flewelling.
(Okay, the lead is male here, but so is the semi-useless second; the leads are
a gay couple).  Even a couple sci-fi's I've read lately; a john Scalzi I
finished recently, a David Weber some time before that.  Hell, even Suzanne
Collins' _Hunger Games_ trilogy.

With that said, that O'Malley does sound interesting.  I may have to see fi I
can fit it into my current run of Richard Castle, Mercedes Lackey, and Kyra
Davis.  Oh, and Neil Gaiman/ Terry Pratchett (yes, I'm only finally getting
around to reading _Good Omens_).

Well, I clearly have been.  Butcher's Dresden files are a classic case.
There's what, one strong female character in the first several books and she's
portrayed as hating Harry for no rational reason (Charity).  Susan is pretty
useless, certainly in the beginning, existing mainly to act as love interest
and look pretty.  She promptly gets eaten by vampires when Harry fails to
protect her.  Most of the other females that get introduced are mad or evil,
generally both.  The werewolves are wet behind the ears and get mutilated with
alarming regularity.  Molly is whiny and plain annoying pretty much from the
moment we first meet her.  In the most recent book there was something of a
change of tack, which was refreshing, but in the first 12 books the female
characters get a pretty raw deal.  I like Butcher's writing on the whole, I
really do, but honestly.

I also really like Jacka's Alex Verus novels, but they're another case in
point.  One female apprentice who can't control her powers and is mostly worse
than useless, and one female character who's completely derranged.  Oh, and one
good one - who's a giant spider.

Ben Aaronvitch has nice style, but here we go again, the main female character
gets fairly minimal page time and gets horribly mutilated at the end of the
first book.  She then spends most of the second hiding from the world in
general.  Maybe she has more to do in the next one, but so far I haven't
mustered up the enthusiasm to download it.

The Iron Druid Chronicles were so depressing I gave up after two books.
Honestly the dog is given more personality than the female characters (who are,
once again, largely mad).

You may say, why care?  But actually I do care.  Why can't the women have the
snappy, witty dialogue and the interesting backstories?  Why do they largely
seem to exist to have sex with the male characters, or not, because he's too
troubled to get involved, even though he wants to (ugh).  These things seep
into our consciousness, even if we don't realise it.

Jon Rosenberg deserves special mention for being a male author who manages to
write with a male lead AND includes a strong female character as well (gasp).
I'm looking forward to his next book.  O'Malley as well, who's done a fabulous
job of creating all female leads.  Obviously Pratchett with his wonderful
witches, but he gets most things right :-)

Actually The Hunger Games is an interesting case.  A female author,
contemporary fantasy, interesting questions about violence and 'reality'
entertainment... But oh deary me.  How annoying is Katniss, especially in the
second and third book?  Very, very annoying indeed.  Any sense of humour?  No.
Whiny beyond belief?  Oh yes.  Endlessly preoccupied by some stupid love
triangle.  Honestly.  If I could have walked into the pages of the third book
in particular I'd have given her a slap and told her to get a grip.  At least
the Twilight novels managed (just about) to build in the idea of self-discovery
- well, once you got past the second book which again involved a LOT of whining
and moping - and they do have the defence of following in the grand tradition
of all vampire stories (i.e. they're about sexual awakening).

I haven't read the Twilight books (and have no plans to, despite one of my
closer friends loving them *heh*), but agreed, Hunger Games is an interesting
case.  I think a lot of the problems with the second and third books comes from
them needing to be two books.  Probably a publisher demand, there.  Reading
them, it comes acros to me as what was intended to be a single book.  But it
took off, and the publisher wanted more, and two kore to fit the trilogy setup
so common to the genre.  _Catching Fire_ and _Mockingjay_ seem like two
half-books, split and padded.

But definitely, read some others.  Shearin's "Raine Benares" series features a
heroine who's a bit of a white-hat rogue (as are Flewelling's heroes,
incidentally), and yes, there's a love triangle.  But exactly none of the three
principles the is useles, and when one is, it's one of the guys.  Weber's
sci-fi involves female characters who kick ass and take names - and believe me,
they make sure they get the names.  There's also an on-and-off-again series,
sci-fi, from Thomas Harlan with several interesting and far from useles
characters of both sexes.  Tales of the Sixth Sun or something like that is the
series.  Scalzi's _Redshirts_ and _Agent to the Stars_ both feature strong and
useless characters, major and minor, of both sexes.  Both are a little bit
tongue-in-cheek though, humorous at times - though Redshirts in particular is
much deeper than that.  And while it's fluff-fantasy (as is Shearin, to be
honest, but a hell of a lot of fun :-) ), there's Jim Hines' "Fairytale
Princesses" as well.

So, a mix of male and female writers, male and female (and with Flewelling's
"Nightrunners'" more gender nuance with two male leads and a lot of strong
minor characters, as well) characters, fantasy and sci-fi.  There's a LOT of
strong, solid work out there, across the spectrum.

And yes, I read a lot :-)

strong female characters in the dresden files.  I have to disagree that there
are not more strong female characters in the the first several books.

This will contain spoilers.

I think you dismissed Susan a little fast, yes she got in over her head and yes
she turned into a partial red court vampire but that actually jsut added a new
depth to her strength.  Her character as written is a hard nose journalist who
routinly takes on the mainstream media as well as the city government itself.
After she is turned she shows greater depth by joining the order and fighting
not only as a journalist but a front line soldier.

Karrin Murphy> Saves Harry more times then he saves her.  Stands up to people
like marcone, the feds as well as every creapy crawlie from the never that
comes out.

You got Charity right but wrong.  She is a strong principaled woman who will
stand up to Harry and her reasons for not liking him aren't baseless.  Her
husband gets hurt every time Harry shows up which is more then enough reason to
dislike someone.  But she's not in my opinion as strong as the other two above.
 She shirked her own power and and hid behind her husband, buries her money int
he ground as it was put.

Molly> Yes Molly is a bit of a teenage girl when she first shows up but she's
got a lot of strength in her and doesn't back down.  Granted I've never been a
teenage girl but from the ones I've known I think he did a fairly good job of
writing one.

Laura>  White court vamp, she's bad or maybe not, either way she's still a
strong female character.  Granted she hides behind her father but that is the
society not her.

Then of course you have the fairy queens etc that show up from time to time as
well as Harry's godmother.  Georgia the wolf turns out to be vfairly strong and
resilient as well.

It may be that you didn't see a lot of it as they did develop over time but
Butcher has had lots of strong women come in and out of the story but he's
stayed very true to his viewpoint that he cast for harry.  from Storm Front

"I caught up and walked a little ahead of her.

She sped her pace. So did I.

We raced one another toward the front door, with increasing speed, through the
puddles left over from last night's rain. My legs were longer; I got there
first. I opened the door for her and gallantly gestured for her to go in. It
was an old contest of ours. Maybe my values are outdated, but I come from an
old school of thought. I think that men ought to treat women like something
other than just shorter, weaker men with breasts. Try and convict me if Im a
bad person for thinking so. I enjoy treating a woman like a lady, opening doors
for her, paying for shared meals, giving flowersall that sort of thing."

Yes Harry is always out to save the women, but that is just who he is and a lot
of the time its not needed.  Check out the warrior sometime when he kills the
power to a whole block to keep one drunk guy from working instead of just
telling the guys boss.

Are there authors who write stronger female characters, sure; but there is a
lot of strength hidden in the women of sci-fi/fantasy without them being the
main characters.

remember Courage isn't not being afraid, it is what you do in spite of being
afraid.

I haven't read Dresden, so I can't comment specifically, there.  But a few
caveats:

1. Just because they're evil or utterly mad doesn't make them strong
characters.  Unless you wish to suggest/ imply that there aren't evil, mad, or
otherwise vengeful/ inadmirable women, just as there are men.  Why should all
the villains be men, either?

2. What about the male characters?  Are there evil, vengeful, and/ or mad ones?
And if so, then what makes it fair that those depictions are okay, but not
female ones?

3. How about the reverse?  I'm just as tired of the trope of the
one-dimensional hero - of either sex - as of the simpering female.  There are a
LOT of characterization cliches in fiction, and many if not most of them show
up in one fantasy or another; for that matter, in one mystery or another too. 
And shall we discuss the tired, cliched portrayal of BOTH sexes in romance
novels? (I realize we're in the Fantasy/SF forum, but...).  Or for that matter,
mystery/ thriller?  It seems whoever the MC is in those, male or female, pretty
much _everyone_ else around said MC is dumb and useless.  And those two
(mystery and romance) are the two best-selling fiction categories.

In short, I think you're being a bit harsh about fantasy in particular, and
characterization specifically.  Especially with so many examples out there of
the opposite of the phenomenon, especially in more recent (the past decade or
so) works.

That, or as I said, you need to read better writers *heh*

Actually, in Dresden, I'm struggling to think of that many male villains.
There were a couple of demonically-possed dudes, but actually, most of the real
lunatics were female.  On the other hand, the male 'baddies' often turn to have
a complex, redeemable side (such as Johnny Marcone).

I don't have a problem with female villains.  I'm just saying that it's
unbalanced in Butcher's work.  At least, it was in the first few books.
There's been a change in the recent novels, particularly the last two.  Susan
returned and became a lot more interesting.  The girlfriend of Thomas (can't
remember her name) grew a backbone and became more than just pretty food.
Mollie developed into a stronger, slightly less annoying character (she's still
really annoying, but it's a marginal improvement) and Charity was given a
backstory that actually made her attitude understandable.  But that didn't
happen until his books were in double figures.

I'm not criticising all fantasy.  I love fantasy, and particularly contemporary
fantasy.  Sword and Sorcery is less my thing, but I've read bits here and
there (as a kid I started with Eddings; for all Eddings' faults, you've got to
admit Polgara was pretty damn cool).  The trouble is after reading a lot of
contemporary fantasy there are repeating themes.  Namely, damaged-maveric-
male-lead-with-tragic-dark-past and the wimpy-but-attractive-female-
apprentice-type-who-he's-quite-attracted-to.  The male lead gets to make all
the wisecracks and has all the best dialogue.  The woman, at best, gets to
raise an eyebrow at him here are there.  When there's a leading female, she in
invaribly caught up in some sort of a silly love triangle, mopes over one or
the other, and never does the obvious thing of telling them both to get lost.

Anyway, this started because I was talking about Rook, which is refreshingly
different.  All the leads in that are female, and they get the vast majority of
witty lines.  The author cheerfully dispatches a number of male characters and,
oh my days, there is NO stupid love triangle, or a crowbarred-in love scene.
Oh the novelty!  More please :-)

And I did look up some of the authors you suggested but (a) sword and sorcery
or (b) not on Kindle :-)

*nods* It did.  I'm simply suggesting your reading is a bit narrow, to
characterize "fantasy" as broad-blanket possessing those elements.  Now, you're
specifically criticizing Dresden, and limiting others' proof of otherwise to
remove certain subsets (sorry, but S&S is still - and likely always will be - a
HUGE part of the body of fantasy lit, even perhaps a majority), and only
limited to what's available on kindle?  Not exactly fair in its balance of how
to assess.  And it only reinforces my point: you're just not reading the right
things.  It's out there, and in abundance; you're just not willing to look for
it or consider it.  It isn't the genre that's limited; it's you, sorry to say.

Thank you for making that clear.  I think, given the following, you can see
why I might have been confused:

"(I am so tired of the cliche of a tortured male fantasy lead with a slightly
useless female apprentice/side-kick)."
yours, post # 42630

Post #42632 cites a host of different fantasies, and condemns them all.  You
give nods to Jon Rosenberg and to O'Malley in '632, but I'm not sure they're
truly fantasy?  Both writers seem a bit nebulous defined in that category.
And in fact, Amazon and B&N both classify both writers elsewhere.

You then proceed to roundly condemn "Hunger Games," - which despite its most
definite flaws, is ALL about a strong female lead character - and dismiss all
of my other suggestions as "not being into Sword and Sorcery" (never mind that
half of them were science fiction, not actually fantasy at all; who isn't
reading posts properly?), or not being available on Kindle.

So, forgive me, but I think I _have_ read your posts accurately.  You're just
upset at being called out and proven incorrect, yet again, on something, and
have reached a point where continuing to limit the pool of data won't save
your conjecture.  And I'm not the only one to point it out, and every time
someone does, you've moved the goalposts, until finally you lash out at me.

None of which, incidentally, changes my interest in _The Rook_.  I'd seen it
already, at B&N, and got a copy yesterday.  I hope it's as good as you've said.

I think '643 specifies exactly what I meant.  Given that it does so with
evidence, explaining the interpretation, and it appears logical (not to mention
that others seem to have agreed with my assessment of your position), I stand
by it.  Also, I specifically reject the notion that I was attacking you - it
seems clear that what I was challenging was your contention regarding fantasy
and its writing nuances.  And as a writer of same, I think I've got a right to
do so.

Further, as for the accusation of "vehemently" attacking you, I don't think
I've been vehement at all, attacking or not.  I took a position, explained my
interpretation - with logic, and with supporting information and evidence
including your own posts/ words.  And if you go back and read the entire
thread, I started out simply discussing, as well.  It wasn't until you
challenged me, essentially blowing me off as an idiot, that I took your
interpretation (again, with evidence and explanation) specifically to task. 
And given that you have a track record of this, with me and others, in other
forums, I think it's fair to say that my interpretation isn't at all off base.

This is the last I'm going to say on the subject - so if you want the last
word, by all means take it.  I expect it.  But may I respectfully suggest you
re-examine - with as neutral an eye as possible - the thread before you do so,
and consider how it might fit other patterns.  As you yourself said, other
opinions are available.  Recent posts in other forums, in fact, might provide

I think Cowl is interesting, in that he clearly has an agenda.  And I'd really
like to know how he survived the backlash from the Darkhallow.

But I don't think Cowl is half as interesting as Nicodemus.  I'm waiting for
Nicodemus to reappear in later books.....he can't have been killed at the end
of Small Favor.


Marcone, though, is the one that has been getting the most character
development.  Finding out what motivated him to take over crime in Chicago,
occasionally showing signs of humanity but also still being able and willing to
put people down (shooting some of the White Court to make a point on the escape
at the end of White Night; smacking Billy down in the short story with Murphy
taking place after Changes, etc)


Re women:  Murphy is the most interesting one to me.  Always has been, after
the first book or two.  Susan isn't/wasn't bad, but she wasn't around a lot to
*get* much development.  Hell, Kincaid has had more development than Susan did.

Lara, I like.  I think she's also one of the more interesting women in the
books.  For once, you have a supernatural woman who *isn't* just going around
smacking people down.  Not b/c she *can't*, but b/c she does more damage
behind the scenes!

Shortly behind Murphy for interest for me, though, are Lea and Mab.  The more
you learn about both of them, esp Lea and the continuing help she gives b/c of
Harry's mother, the more interesting I find them.  I want to know what was the
madness contamination magic on the athame Lea got, and who put it there.  :) 
After her throwaway comment in Ghost Story, I'm waiting with anticipation for
when Lea next encounters Cowl.  :)


I just finished reading Ghost Story (it *finally* came out in pback, the
bastards....).  I found Molly much more interesting in it, to be honest.  While
Molly's been getting stronger throughout, she's been more of a sketch than a
developed character until maybe Changes.  I'm looking forward to reading the
Molly-centric short story Butcher mentioned on his website a couple months ago.

demons male/female?  It's an interesting question...

I've just started Hard Magic by Laura Anne Gilman.  I'm not very far into it,

Actually while I think of it, one series that I haven't mentioned yet is/are
the Women of the Otherworld, by Kelly Armstrong.  Those are great books,

Bitten, Stolen, Broken, No Humans Involved and Frostbitten.  Oh and Men of the

Gilman is pretty excellent all around.  Her Vin Lands series was brilliant -
and I almost mentioned that series, in fact, when talking about the ones I'd
read recently with excellent female characters.  I'm not sure it counts,
though, since it's a) by a female author (though I did mention a couple others
by female authors) and b) sword-and-sorcery.  But she also writes mystery, or
at least has written a first one, under the name L. A. Kornetsky, and has done
some YA fantasy as well (though it's hard to find).  Also her Retrievers books.

She's also quite the wine person; she may have been beforehand, but when

At least some of the Fallen appear to have some kind of gender as we would
understand it:  Lasciel in particular has been mentioned as The Temptress and
other feminine words, and Cassius made some comment in Dead Beat about how she
wouldn't have been his first choice.

The Denarians largely fall into two groups:  the brute force, like the beast
guy Harry meets in the alley as his first Denarian (Ursiel?), or the gorilla
guy (Magog).  They don't care about their hosts, use 'em up and burn 'em out.

Then there are the more dangerous, long-term ones like Nicodemus and Anduriel,
Thorned Namshiel (host now deceased), Tessa and hers.  They seem to have some
degree of true partnership between the host and the Fallen.  They also tend to
be the more intelligent, more corrupt ones.


Yes, there are a few that may fall somewhere in between, like Nicodemus'
daughter, but most seem to be short-term brutes *or* long-term corrupters.

So I've read Dresden previously, now I'm listening to the Audiobooks read by
James Marsters.  He was a bit iffy in the first half of book one but then he
got the hang of it.  I really like the job he does from two on.  Anyway, when
I'm done with these, are there any other series that have a good audiobook
reader like Marsters?  I still enjoy reading, but I'm loving the audiobook for
listening on earbuds while doing chores around the house, or listening in the
car for long drives, etc.

I'm interested in seeing how Dresden comes back to the living
non-Faerie/Nevernever world after Mab and Demonreach.  If I was reading the
leaders for Cold Days, he goes back to his friends and gets help for some
investigation:  I'm assuming they mean more than Toot.

I don't know how Murphy and Molly will deal with him after the ending of Ghost
Story, let along how Ramirez and Ebenezer, let alone Elaine, will handle him
after finding out he's both alive and the Winter Knight.


I will agree with you, Ghost Story wasn't wholly satisfying.  However, I wonder
whether it is like Grave Peril, where I found it unsatisfying at the time but
keep finding new depths to it as later books come out....ie, whether it's a
"transition" book that will be a gift that keeps on giving.

Interestingly enough I just reread Grave Peril earlier this week.  I don't
recall ever finding it really unsatisfying.  Honestly, Fool Moon is the one
that does that for me.  Of course I do get tired of Harry beating himself up
over what happened to Susan.  It was NEVER his fault.  She broke the rules.
But then that is one of his character points, but it never was his fault.

But I would say Ghost Story was more transitional.  It needed to be told, at
least some of it (and seeing how Jim does seem to tie everything together
probably all of it).

I haven't read anything about it, from it, etc.  I'm going in to it, well,
Cold.  I really don't think Jim would attempt to keep Dresden away from all
his other friends for another book.  I think that would be pretty harsh.

Just a few more days.  I wonder will the kindle version be available at
midnight?

Fool Moon just seemed like an author's second book:  "I published my first book
finally....now what the hell do I write about?"

Grave Peril just felt jumbled to me, like there was too much going on and not
enough space to think it out the way that Butcher learned to do better as the
series went on.  Like, Small Favor was intricate, so was Dead Beat.... but in
both those cases (especially Small Favor), I felt like *he* had control of the
story, whereas Grave Peril feels more like the story was fighting him.  It
felt like it needed an element taken out, or another 50-100 pages to weave
things together better.

I can totally agree that he learned better craft as he has gone along.  The
early ones are certainly that, early.  Yet, I rarely felt like Butcher didn't
really know what to do or where to go.  Not likely that two people are ever
going to have the exact same feelings or opinions.  With Grave Peril I could
see how some additional girth might have made things a bit more fleshed out.
I almost wonder if that was the editor telling him to cut things because he
wasn't the most established author at that point.

Whatever the case I have to agree mostly with Nightspawn... each time I
reread them (Except Fool Moon for me) I generally go, Oooh, I really liked
this one.  Though Turn Coat and Changes have GOT to be two of my favorites.

they are SF so you might dig 'em.

[Spoiler Space for Cold Days]




























[OK, if you go past this point you CAN'T POSSIBLY be annoyed about a spoiler,
can you? :)]
























Just finished it.  I really enjoyed it, although I will admit that I think the
series is falling off just a bit and it might be time to wind it up in a few
books (which Butcher has announced he plans to do).

The F-bomb thing didn't really faze me at all, although I will say it seemed a
bit out of place and maybe out of character - perhaps Butcher was trying to
emphasize the feral rage aspects of the Winter Knight mantle?

The angle with the island was pretty cool, and I can see him using the
Outsiders as a new variety of Uber-villain that makes it more interesting than
the run of the mill vamps etc he's been fighting.

Plenty of good grist for the mill to keep things interesting in the next book,
what with the parasite in his head, Molly having replace Maeve and becoming the
Winter Lady and all.

Cold Days>



































<Spoilerific Content to Follow>























I get what you're saying about it "falling off a bit" bit I really feel like
Ghost Story and Cold Days are really more setting the stage for the final set
of Dresden Files after which will be the apocalyptic trilogy.  There was SOOO
much information thrown at us in Cold Days.

Just what the island iself is, why the laylines all come (from) there.  Etc.

I actually gasped in astonishment when Molly bacame the Winter Lady.  My wife
was wondering what in the world I was so shocked about.  Poor Charity, she's
gonna flip.

I wondered a couple of days after if Butcher was using the F-word as that, an
expression of the Winter Knight's different view on the world.  Harry uses it,
just never seemed to be quite so much.  So either Jim was using it as a means
to express something, or just went a bit crazy with it.

I was a bit disappointed in the Karrin/Harry on/off thing again.  All the same
reasons we've heard before.  But then, Molly does have the hots (is it the
chills now) for him and as the WK maybe that would work out better.  Course
Harry did catch a bit of advice after that Halloween was over... a day to kill
an immortal and lay down mantles.  I just don't see him finishing up as the WK.
 I could be wrong, especially if he has to face off the Outsiders which is the
Winter Court's primary job it seems.  I just think Harry would like to be
himself.

Guess we'll find out.  I hate waiting.

Regarding the Dresden Files, one thing that struck me at the end of Ghost Story
was Uriel's choice of the six words.

Unless I'm missing something in the scene, Uriel said that Mab was lying to
Harry.

Which faeries aren't supposed to be able to do.

Now, of course, there's wiggle room in that:  Mab could have just been
misleading him without actually speaking an untruth.  We know faeries are
allowed to do that, and in fact the Sidhe are masters of that sort of
deception.

 Spoiler Space





















Foreshadowing>  there has been a ton of foreshadowing to Harry's battle with
the outsiders
1] Harry's magic can affect outsiders while most wizards magic can not.  See
him banishing a walker at 15

2] Harry overheard McCoy talking about a prophecy and him

3] There was much consternation when Harry was the one to bind to the Prison as
the Warden.

It seems pretty obvious that the nemisis is working with or may be an outsider
and that Harry is going to have to lead the battle against them.

This actually makes why Mab was so hot on getting Harry as the Winter Knight
once you realize that the reason for the Winter Fey is to gaurd the gate. 
Having the only wizard who can affect outsiders on your team is a must.

Combine that with it being a wizard who has ties to Uriel, who is probably most
definatly agianst the outsiders, having ties to the remaining Knight of the
Sword and the custodian of the other 2.  We know that the Swords are affective
against the outsiders.  Not to mention that Harry is bound by Love to Molly (a
little different version on both sides) the new winter lady, to Karen who can
wield one of the Swords.  McCoy one of the strongest combat mages on the planet
and you get a picture at Mab's new Dream Team to sqaure off in the next round.
Butcher has stated he's writing these all as preludes to a final trilogy and I
have to say he's doing a really good job with the setup so far.

_Trapped_ (The latest iron Druid Chronicles book)

Really enjoyed this, but felt let down a bit by the ending.

I thought the whole sub-plot of binding his apprentice to the earth was great,
but pretty much once we got to the fight with Fenris it was like he realized he
was out time time and the story came to a screeching halt.

I did enjoy the way Hearne is showing that there are reprocussions to Atticus's
actions, and not just for killing Thor either.

The Dark Elves are a nice touch as well.

Looking forward to _Hunted_ but I hope he does a better ending :)

A few questions:
I recently learned that the movie How To Train Your Dragon is based on a series
of books.  What age group is that aimed at?  Looking at the covers I'm thinking
early teens or younger.  Is it something an adult would enjoy like Harry Poter
(Potter) or is it less appealing?

I saw a couple books at the bookstore that the covers kinda intrigued me, was
curious if anyone had read them and if they're worth going to the library for?

That's EXACTLY 200 DVDs... so more special features than I thought since the
films aren't in yet, but ok... All the movies through Nemesis is 20 discs
assuming all 2-DVD special editions...  All 2 more for the new film...


That's 222 DVDs.

1.1 TB if they averaged 5GB per DVD... If they were all 100% STUFFED to the
absolute MAX of double-sided DVDs it's 9.4GB per- which is still only 2.09 TB.


Since they're not going to all be 100% stuffed you can easily fit it all on one
2TB drive....which is 60-70 bucks... if you MUST have it backed up as well...
(which is a little odd since you have the physical DVDs as backup)... you can
just buy a second 2Tb drive for another 60-70 bucks.


Anyway, nowhere near 8-10TB...

OK, here's a question for long-time Star Trek (TOS) fans.  Not meant to be a
trivia question or a "gotcha", just looking for answers.

Through out the original series, how many different people commanded the
Enterprise, including acting commanders, regardless of the reason.  I remember
this question from my college days back in the 70s, I think the number was like
15 total.  I've got 11, anyone who can add others, I'd be interested.

1) Kirk
2) Spock
3) Scotty
4) Sulu
5) Pike
6) #1 (Pike's exec)
7) Commodore Decker
8) Mr. DaSalle
9) Commodore Stocker
10) Ambassador Fox
11) M5 computer (OK M5 wasn't a person, but it did command the Enterprise
during an exercise.)

WHo am I missing?

I wouldn't consider movies and animated series "the original series."

Although Chekov was tasked with keeping the planet between Enterprise and the
Klingons in "A Private Little War," and he was in charge of that, there doesn't
seem to be anything indicating he was the commanding officer. Particularly
since Scott was there on the bridge with him. And while the positions are
intechangeable to some degree, wouldn't that be the helmsman's job? Or was that
when George Takei was busy filming Green Berets in season 2 and they gave
Koenig more screentime?

If you're going to consider Ambassador Fox the "captain" in "A Taste of
Armageddon," you might as well consider Commissioner Ferris in The Galileo
Seven as well. he does give Kirk the order to leave Taurus 5. "I now assume
authority granted me under title 15, galactic emergency procedure, and I order
you to abandon search."

I'm not convinced in either case, Fox or Ferris or any ambassador, that just
because they have the right to order Kirk or a subordinate/designated captain
to do something, that it makes them the "captain." They can command a captain,
but that doesn't make them "the captain."

I think the Memory Alpha entry is misleading. Chekov is indeed in charge of
navigating the Enterprise and making sure that the Klingons don't spot them.
Checking the transcripts, there's no "Chekov you have the conn" dialogue.

In fact, Kirk leaves the bridge early in the episode and says, "You have the
conn, Scotty." when he goes to sickbay to check on Spock. Later, it's Scott who
contacts Kirk on the planet and says that they'll be out of communicator range,
and Kirk who tells him that they'll arrange a rendezvous schedule later.

And that's all you hear from Chekov until later, when Spock is back on th
bridge and Chekov has a single line of dialogue.

"In command" has a specific military meaning.  For example, the captain of a
USN warship is the ulimate authority abaord the vessel, but clearly must obey
those in his chain of command, up to and including the PotUS.  In the case of
the question I posed, Kirk must obey the orders of his superiors who "popped up
on a view screen", but Kirk is still in command of Enterprise.  He can delegate
the command authority to others, as can his chain of command as with the Fox
and the guy I couldn't remember.  Conversely, when others (Kelvins etc.) took
over the ship, they were not legally in command any more than pirates are
legally in command of ship they seize of Somailai.

Sorry, forgot to make my second point.  As of now, we appear to have identified
12 different individuals who legally commanded the Enterprise on TOS.  (Agree,
btw that animated series and movies don't count.)  Like I said originally, I
think the asnwer was 15, but in hindsight in might have been just 13.  Even if
that's the case, we'd still be missing at least one more.

One other point I'd forgotten about when this came up back in the 70s (before
Roddenberry came to campus as part of the "college lecture circuit"), there was
one guy who was fanatical that Dr. McCoy be included in the group.  The fact
that only line officers (not doctors, lawyers, chaplain etc.) can command
combat forces didn't sway this guy as he pointed out senior medical officer,
McCoy could relieve anyone of his/her command.  While that was true, McCoy
himself could not legally assume command, but he'd hear none of it.  Years
later, I saw an episode of TNG where Dr, Crusher was in command.  I remember
wondering if that guy from back in the 70s saw that episode.

Well, the initial question was "regardless of the reason" not "a specific
military meaning." So we seem to have gone a little far afield...

Insofar as the M5 could be shut down at any time and was an experiment with
what was believed to be a computer rather than an AI,, I'd say it wasn't in
command by any specific military meaning. It was a really smart autopilot,
basically. By the same they knew it was a highly sophisticated AI, it had
pirated the ship.

I'm repeating a question that originally asked in 1972 or 73, none of the
movies had been made yet, and I doubt the cartoon had either.  In any event,
the question dealt strictly wihthe TOS.

The "for whatever reason" was to cover the situations where Kirk did not leave
someone in command, but some was legally in command such as Fox.  AS I said
when I posted the question, I was skeptical about the M% being on the list, but
I know it was.  Don't remember if the school paper or radio station ran the
contest, but I do know they cited specific information to verify each name on
the list.  Was their dialogue in that episode that specified the computer was
in command?  I remember the commander of the attack force made some snide
comment about Kirk being useless or not in command.

So anyway, I'm sure there is at least one more name missing after you added the
commissioner.  I do remember the one most people missed was DeSalle, he was in
command just once, and I think he only appeared in a handful of episodes.

Once Upon a Planet is kind of fun. More Tribbles, More Troubles is supposed to
be funny, but it's more of a Trouble With Tribbles greatest hits and the
botched cel coloring (pink Tribbles??) is very distracting. The Survivor kis

Interesting bit of trivia


One week before the official 1966-67 television season began, NBC previewed two
of its new fall series. Both turned out to be pop-culture milestones, winning
millions of fans around the world and making an impact that lasted far beyond
the shows' brief network runs.

One of those series was "Star Trek," which premiered on Thursday, Sept. 8,
1966. The other was a half-hour situation comedy, which debuted on Monday,
Sept. 5, 1966. It was called "The Monkees."

You posted the blurb: do you agree with it or not? And why?

Nick at NIte hasn't shown it in years, so that seems pretty minimal impact. And
lots of shows have won 2+ Emmys and lived on thanks to some network or another
airing repeats. I'm getting Big Valley on three different channels but I
wouldn't call it having an impact.

The fact that a 60s band won't die, and goes on nostalgia tours, isn't really
very impact-ful either. If I had a nickel for everyone that did, I'd be a rich
man.

But rather than non-debate some anonymous writer, why do _you_ think the
Monkees had an impact in some way comparable to Star Trek? Did I miss NASA
naming a shuttle the "Davey Jones"?

The Monkees are to the Beatles what Weird Al is to Michael Jackson. Therefore,
they're probably living on because of that. :P

The impact they've caused however isn't easily seen, unlike Star Trek which has
its obvious links to space stuff; therefore we have the Enterprise shuttle, the
Enterprise spaceplane, an Enterprise statue in a town called Vulcan, and a lot
of scientists trying to recreate stuff from ST like the medical device,
forcefields, and the tablet computers.

there it was a bit derivative of some beatles stuff (from their early films)...

If by "isn't easily seen" you mean "pretty much non-existent," well, yeah... :)

I think the main indicator that they haven't had any relatively significant
impact is because... almost no one was claiming that they had any significant
impact until Davey Jones died. And in a week or so, no one will be claiming it
again.

Star Trek isn't only considered having a significant impact when a cast member
dies.

Star Trek's actors are all prettymuch still active in media or acting in some
way.

Shatner is still on TV, is an author and attends conventions
Nimoy also has all that going for him

And there was an Enterprise long before Star Trek ever existed

Two ships of the Continental Navy were named Enterprise (source is Wikipedia)

This is an updated and expanded history of ships named "Enterprise", and
replaces the previous edition (uploaded in December 1988) which is still
available in this data library. During the year which has elapsed, I've been
able to obtain more detail on the U.S. Navy "Enterprises", track down the
history of all British Royal Navy ships called "Enterprise", and obtain limited
information on French Navy "Enterprises" and a Confederate "Enterprise. b(
b(Between 1705 and 1979, there were 12 'HMS Enterprises", while between 1775
and 1999, there were 8 "USS Enterprises". There have also been 8 NASA and
Starfleet "Enterprises", 8 French "Enterprises", 1 Confederate "Enterprise",
and countless privately-owned "Enterprises". As I researched the history of the
name, I quickly realized that each of these ships had a fascinating history,
and that the missions and patrols carried out by each ship are a reflection of
the state of international relations and maritime technology at that point in
time. I hope you will also find this interesting reading.

For anybody interested in reading about the impact of Star Trek on culture,
current events, etc, peruse the following links. They contain information from
many different times, not just when people related to Star Trek die.

If you must know, TNG and the likes WERE MADE because of the impact that ST:TOS
had on people. ST:TOS made such an impression on SOME PEOPLE that even TNG and
the likes couldn't compare.

But here are cultural influences.. feel free to comment.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_influence_of_Star_Trek

The above link talks about ST:TOS impacts.

THE FOLLOWING BLURB SUMMARIZES WELL: "The original series, which aired in the
late 1960s, has since spawned five successor series, eleven movies, a plethora
of merchandise, and a multi-billion dollar industry collectively known as the
Star Trek franchise (currently owned by CBS Television Studios, which now owns
television properties previously held by Paramount Pictures, the studio that
produced Star Trek for many decades; CBS Paramount continues to hold DVD rights
to the TV series, and the rights to produce feature films)."

http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Social/star_trek/SH7.htm

The above link is also about ST:TOS.

It talks about multicultural crew, fans (trekkies from the 70s), NASA renaming
a shuttle due to fans, movie from fan request, scientific/engineering community
effect, AND plenty of sources.

http://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/star_trek.html

The above link is from NASA. Talks about technology IRL (in real life) that is
based on or similar to Star Trek "technology".

http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/11/30/gene-roddenberrys-son-explores-impact

Talks about Roddenberry's son.. very general and short, but talks about this
show: www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ek3h6v3NJU  <<-- TRAILER ONLY

http://www.trektoday.com/columns/takeontrek/takeontrek_200999.shtml

The above link is sort of a response to "Star Trek didn't have aan impact on
culture". It has plenty of great examples of how it DID.

http://thejeffriestube.hubpages.com/hub/Star-Treks-Impact-on-Society-and-Techno
logy

TINYURL: http://tinyurl.com/7pjfxq6

The above url is similar to the previous, shorter  though and different points
(sort of)

LAST URL: http://althistory.wikia.com/wiki/Cultural_Impact_%28No_Star_Trek%29

The above url talks about an alternate reality where there is "No Star Trek".
Interestingly enough, it uses the use of a science fiction device popularized
throughout ST, the use of alternate timelines or timelines being alterable.


FOR ME, ST (all episodes) have inspired me and made me dream and think of the
world as what it could be, what it should be, and what we can do to make it the
best for all people.

ST has made lots of people DREAM BIGGER. It is good to have big dreams because
the world tries to crush people... dreams keep the hope alive...

Dream on ST fans, fellow trekkies, dream on!!!

The USS Enterprise (CVN-65) is off on her final cruise.

Or made famous decades earlier by being the worlds first nuclear aircraft
carrier... (and first to ever engage in combat)... or as a tracking station for
John Glenns first american orbital space flight...


Speaking of movies, it's worth noting that while the real Enterprise appeared
in Top Gun in 1986, the Enterprise that appeared in the (also 1986) STAR TREK
film The Voyage Home, was actually the USS Ranger... and the Ranger actually
stood in for Enterprise in Top Gun as well for some interior shots.

JJA: 01/31/2012 to 01/31/2012
VOY: 01/31/2012 to 03/15/2012

The "JJA" is in reference to the J. J. Abrams reset which we have seen many
times outside of the planned viewing timeline. Still, as you can see, it's not
as obsessive as it may seem because in the between times I was able to watch
the entire Monty Python's Flying Circus collection including the Hollywood Bowl

those are two entirely different things.


Something that was IN TAS being mentioned in something that's actually canon
doesn't make TAS, in and of itself, canon.



I could write a novel where Kirk was a transvestite who buggered McCoy on a
daily basis and Spock molested tribbles, that also had a starship named
"Figleaf" in it.

If a later film or tv episode mentioned a starship named Figleaf that wouldn't
make my novel canon.

Aside from a few throwaway lines, the only TAS episode with a significant canon
impact would be Yesteryear.  There's the whole Robert April as first commander
of the Enterprise thing from The Counter-Clock Incident, but that gets even
more confusing with the Abrams reboot.

Throwaway lines in the episodes themselves, that is. The non-canon novels and
comics have dealt further with the non-canon animated series.

It's pretty much a moot point. The fact that Yesteryear isn't canon, but
Spock's Brain is, should tell you how much meaning it has as far as the value
of the product.

Please. The Abrams Star Trek reboot wasn't even remotely confusing.

My very sci-fi lite GF (she's gotten to enjoy a few shows, but origingally only
started watching them to humor me) got the whole alternative reality thing on
the first go.

Abrams made that shit crystal clear via dialogue in the film. Plus, there was
also the bit in the credits where Nimoy was listed as "Spock Prime" a.k.a. "the
original."

As a Trek fan I thought it was great because it didn't fuck with anything
that's already been established, it opens up a world of possibilities and it
had everything a new viewer needs to know to hit the ground running.

My point was the reboot vs. Counter-Clock Incident, specifically. Not whether
the movie was confusing overall. Whether April was the first commander of the
Enterprise has been a point of contention even pre-reboot. since it was part of
the series bible, and Roddenberry wanted him to be the first captain of the
Enterprise NCC-1701.

MeTV is one of those retro channels (but not the Retro Channel). They are
usually picked up by a local channel and carried as a secondary channel (KWWL
runs them in NE Iowa, along with THIS).

Me runs a bunch of stuff from pretty much all eras. Their Saturday night
schedule is... Batman (60s), Lost in Space, Star Trek, Svengooli, Voyage to the
Bottom of the Sea, Get Smart, and Honey West. Daytime, they run stuff like
Rockford Files, Cannon, Kojak, Big Valley, and Perry Mason.

Their even programming is a bit more modern, with stuff like Cheers, Mary Tyler
Moore, Bob Newhart, and so on.

Of course, they're going to scramble that all up in a week or so for the fall
season. They're adding Remington Steele, Emergency!, The Danny Thomas Show, The
Donna Reed Show, and Night Gallery, and shuffling some shows around. They're
showing Steele in the 8/7 central weeknight slot, and dropping Peter Gunn for
Night Gallery at the 12:30 a.m./11:30 p.m. slot on weeknights. They're shifting
Wild Wild West from Saturday afternoons to five-time-a-week at 4/3 central p.m.
Their website has their fall schedule, I think, but I haven't checked it
recently.

They run the remastered Trek, and so far they've been running them in airdate
order, rather than the remastered release schedule. Which makes for a bit more
coherent viewing.

MeTV typically runs older stuff than TVLand, IMO. A lot of black and white
stuff, and late 60s/early 70s. Cheers seems to be the newest show they have.

The website has local providers listed. They've been around for at least wo
2 years. It looks like they launched in 2010 nationally, but were around as
early as 2005 in Chicago.

On the other hand, I seem to recall reading an article somewhere that the push
in "role-playing" is into the video game/MMORPG arena, particularly with people
looking for their first taste of the games.

Obviously I'm a dedicated table top/pen & pencil RPGer. But my players spend
more time playing MMORPGs than tabletop.

Is the industry having increasing sales these days, or decreasing sales? I
suspect the latter. So an attempt to turn D&D into more of a MMORPG/"video
game" isn't an unreasonable one if that's how and where the market is going.

If there's a problem, it's that WOTC didn't go after the MMORPG crowd hard
enough, and failed to use 4e as a "gateway" into tabletop RPGing. I think
there's also a disdain of old-school RPGers toward the new MMORPGers. It may
also be that the attempt was doomed from the start, and video games don't
translate into tabletop and the MMORPGers are going to remain only MMORPGers.

The rules emphasis was all on combat and unless you were using minis combat was
very difficult as most every feat relied on where you were positioned.

I actually felt that 4E was an attempt to give all the people who bitched about
balance a balanced game. And it was. But it turns out that such wasn't really
the problem. 4E can be as grim, humorous, or the like as you want it to be.
I've been playing in a 4E game now for two years and we frequently go for
multiple sessions without combat. But most people have trouble roleplaying when
there aren't clear rules for it. 4E pretty much provided rules for combat and
left everything else up to the GM and players. I suspect we'll be getting
something along the lines of D&D 3.75 for the next edition, as they want to
pull the Pathfinder people back in and have the ability to spawn an endless
number of books.

For the most part, social interaction rules in RPGs are there so you dont' ahve
have to role-play. They serve the same function as combat rules: to provide a)
a way for a player to do something that they can't do normally, and b) a way
for the GM to adjudicate such interactions in as fair and balanced a manner as
possible without bias.

"I roll a 15 and get her into the sack" is no more role-playing than "I roll a
15 and skewer his gizzard." The role-playing comes in from the motivation and
rationale of the character that the player applies to determine why they want
their character to get the courtesan into the sack, or skewer the black knight.
No rule is necessary for that.

I guess I find it somewhat creepy to have someone who is a cretin play a

Also, isn't there a Create Magic Item ritual? And skill challenges woudl seem
to be non-combat.

While I have no doubt that D&D emphasizes combat ovr non-combat, because a) it
always has, and b) a great many RPGs do the same thing, that's a little
different then saying it's all combat and no skill.

As for crafting per se... I guess that depends on the setting and what the PCs
_do_. Most RPGs either have profession/crafting stuff but it's ill-defined and
players ignore it (you'll almost never hear people in those campaigns saying,
"Wow, I'm going to taek Basket Weaving +8!")...

,.. or it's there but you just don't need it and there are much better skills
to take ("We're wandering a post-apocalyptic wasteland: should I take
Bricklaying +6 or Stealth, Scavenge and Dodge at +2 each? Decisions,
decisions...")...

.... or the designers toss in some uber mechanic or loophole. ("Hey, I can make
wine for $2 a bottle and sell it for $10 according to the gear chart: I'm
taking Wine-Making +10!").

So yeah, it's nice if a player says, "I want a well-rounded character so I'm
going to take Basket-Weaving +4 because gosh done, that's what he did before
he went dungeon wandering." But I've role-played with a lot of folks I'd
consider good role-players, who want well-rounded characters with fleshed-out
backgrounds... and the number who take a "dud" skill are immeasurably small.

Basically, folks I've gamed with are of the high-fantasy/high-adventure type.
They don't want to get into the grind of building houses or building stable, or
heck, swordsmithing. You're getting into economics at that point, not high
adventure. Yeah, if they can build a magic item and adventure with it, they'l
go with it.

So overall, I'm not big on crafting as a skill. Performance... eh. I've never
seen a mechanic that really support it, unless it has some specific in-game
benefit (Tale tellin' in the Pinnacle games, the equivalent in Torg). They're
social skills that affect bigger groups, which always seems to raise the
unanswered question, "If I can Perform and persuade 50 audience members to do
something, why take Persuasion and limit myself to one?" Then you have to watch
the designers fumble at why they _can't_ do that. So while I can understand
that a Performance skill should be there, it always seems to be more headaches
than its worth.

I've learned that if I take a 'dud' skill, my GM will almost never allow it to
be story-important. And so, rather than 'waste' my skill points, I need to meet
the GM's minimum standards, so I won't 'gimp' myself.

As a result, a lot of people have more or less been abused into NOT taking the
'dud' skills.

been an Old School Gamer, and something of a minimalist when it comes to
design.

5th Edition via Monte Cook.  Monte's a good guy, knows a lot, and can design
well.  I've always liked his Arcana Unearthed material.  However, can he square
the circle of successive editions and catering to different interests?  I
rather doubt it, and the conversation so far in this forum tends to confirm
that for me - too many different interests, and that simply isn't going to

A skill like Profession (Basket-Weaving) pretty rarely _is_ going to be
story-important, in even the hands of the most gifted GM.

I think some game designers put such skills into a game in the interest of
"realism", and some players take them in the interests of realism. Which is all
well and good, but realistic doesn't necessary make good high adventure.

I think these days I prefer the model of Smallville and Leverage, which pretty
much eliminate skills and/or subsum ehtem into a larger model.

To take an obvious example, Luke Skywalker. Yes, if you properly generating his
background, he'd probably have Profession/Water-Gather Repair and Craft/Build
Farmhouse or whatever. There are probably some char-gen systems that would give
him that.

But ya now, they just ain't skills he ever _uses_ in the Star Wars movies. And
a GM kinda has an obligation to keep the story going. Nothing brings a story to
a screeching halt than the GM realizing, "Hey, it's been an adventure or two,
it's time for to give Jim-Bob a chance to use his Craft/Underwater
Basket-weaving skill!"

So while I'm sure that many GMs don't give a player a chance to use a certain
skill, or maybe even discourage it, my guess would be there's a reason for it.
Sometimes a reason shared by the players. "Time to sneak into the compound.
Everybody took a couple of levels of Move Silently, right? Oh, wait Realism-Rob
took those couple of levels and put them into Profession/Bricklayer instead.
Guess he'll have to stay behind and... umm, dramatically make a brick outhouise
to distract the bad guys."

PLus, folks' mileage may vary, but I at leaste tend to run cinematic games.
Whether it's spies, or superheroes, or angsty vampires, or pirates on the high
seas, or monster hunters, or high-fantasy warriors and mages... you don't
really see much in the way of books, TV, and cinema where they stop to weave a
basket. Or demonstate their Accountancy profession background. Heck, even stuff
that is useful (Swordsmithing, Armormaking), it's not dwelt on.

Anyhoo, I got cut off and callled away. but my impression with 4th ed was that
a) they wanted to appeal to the MMORPG/combat types, and b) they wanted to
streamline some of the rest.

Relevant to this, the designer has two choices: make the game a "toolbox" and
put in everything, even if only a relatively small % of players may use certain
tools (Craft, Profession, Performance) and such use may drag the game a bit.

Or cut the deadwood, knowing the few % that want it will figure out a way to do
it.

*shrug* My preference is toward the latter these days. And there's at least
some games out there that, like I said, minimize or eliminate skills
altogether. And it makes running con and demo events easier. I love the DC
Adventures game from Green ROnin, but I just look at the character sheets with
all the skills and advantages (Batman, I'm talking to you, but everyone's got a
few non-intuitive advantages) and I just cringe. The power system I like, the
subplotting sytem is ingenious and yet so obvious (subplots don't give you
points at character creation, but give you points within the game when they're
active, which you then use to do cool thigns with your powers on a one-shot
basis). But I look at the skill and advantage system and I say, "I'm never
going to run this. Nobody wants to do that much page-flipping."

I wasn't trying to say that you have to have rules for these, just that 4E
minimalized the non-combat rules. I don't have a problem with that, but it
makes a lot of people feel that they cannot role-play in such a situation.
Actually, rituals was the absolute best idea that 4E had. I'm hoping that they
do incorporate that into new editions.

And I'll agree that I love Mutants and Masterminds, but it is a headache to
run if you have players who truly delve into how complicated character creation
can be. Which is weird, as I love Rolemaster. But I think a lot of that has to
do with Rolemaster being straightforward, even if it's complicated.

Lately, though, I've really wanted to run a simplified game with no stats and
very basic resolution rules. I'll probably be developing the backstory for this
throughout 2012.

I find it hilarious that people think ANY edition of D&D had much in the way of
social interaction rolls, lessee, 3.5 which i think had the most in the way of
rules had basically these  4 skills Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Info, and
Intimidate....and the rules for all them were basicallyy the same Roll high
enough to impress the GM and he'll give you an info dump.  And just for jokes,
here's a scam to run by your GM's, A 10 Foot ladder costs 2 CP, a 10 foot pole
costs 2 SP, take all the rungs off the ladder and you have 2 10 foot poles,
sell poles and get 400% ROI.

They had the core book..I was looking through it and it looked awesome. But,
they wanted $50 for it. No thanks.
Talked to one of my RPG buddies and he had a few of the books.
I borrowed the core book and a few others and holy shit. This looks like an

I'm finally getting my head around the idea that 4E is not a role-playing
system. It is a combat system. Roleplaying has always been and will always be
difficult, if not impossible, to codify. That's why I prefer the tabletop.

I need my fellow participants at the table with me. Sure, Alice gets up to make
a sandwich and Bob goes to the bathroom just before his turn comes up and
Chrissy is gossiping across the map with Dirk (not his real name) while I'm
trying to set the scene for them. It's irritating but at least I have
satisfaction of knowing they care enough about the effort I have made to create
the story for them.

You can never ever have that sense of togetherness playing an online game. It's

If you're unhappy with archers mke a house rule about them but a standard rule
of thumb is an exeprienced archer can but 1 arrow downrange, ACCURATLY, in 5

its a fantasy game you could easily up it to 3/2 or 2/1 if you wanted to.

Okay, picked up the Marvel Heroic RPG. At least through DriveThru, you get a
234 page basic rulebook, then a 48-page handout of the character sheets (black
on white paper, the rulebook characters are white on black background), a
2-page copy of the basic Watcher (i.e., Gamesheet) rules, and a 1 page Player
summary of the relevant rules. (I'm assuming the last two are also in the basic
rulebook.) That's for... $12.99 or thereabouts.

The basic system still applies: you roll 2+ dice, keep the best two, add them
together, try to beat a target number.

Looking at Daredevil, yo have...

Affiliations: Solo, Buddy, Team. at d10, d8, d6. daredevil is 10-8-6
respectively (number represents the die type).

He then has distinctions (Blind Justice, Man Without Fear, Protector of Hell's
Kitchen). I'm guessing these work like Leverage, where you have two choices:
get an extra d8, or get an extra d4 and a Plot Point (game mechanic/alteration
currency). Rolling ones is bad for th eplayer, good for the GM. So a d4 has a
greater chance of backfiring on you, but you get the PLot POint. Rolling ones
may also get you a plot point/

DD then has two "Power Sets," Billy Club and Hypersenses. Each has three
"powers" and die-rating types. There are several SFX which are like Talents in
Leverage: spend a Plot Point (PP) and get something. Some just work without a
PP. So Focus lets you get rid of two dice of the same type and replace it with
one die of the next step up (get rid of 2d8s, add 1d10). That costs nothing.
Radar Sense, spend a PP to add the Superhuman Senses die type (d10) to th
epool, or kick it to d12 if it's already in the pool. And reroll all dice if
you want.

Each power set has a limit. Do something bad to yourself, gain a PP. So with
Billy Club, spend a PP to shut it down (lose it, presumably), and then "take an
actoin vs. the doom pool" to recover it later.

DD then has Specialities. He has 6, which seem to be do-it-yourself attributes.
So DD has Acrobatic and Crime Master d10, and Covert, Menace, Combat, and Psych
expert d8.

Then he has milestones, which are points in your career where you get XP. So DD
gets 1 XP the first tiem he tells a hero he's not DDevil. He gets 3 when he
goes into action without his mask. He gets 10 when he joins a team, or refuses
to join a team, because of his identity crisis. DDevil has two sets of
milesetones, the second is "Devil in the Dark."

Other characters have similar sets: Three affilations of 10-8-6, three
Distinctions, two power sets, 5-6 Specialties (Emma Frost has five), and two
sets of milestones.

My guess would be that, say, when Daredevil is fighting a mugger in Hell's
Kitchen, he rolls Combat Expert (d8), plus his affiliation (Solo d10), plus one
of his powersets if he chooses to ues them (say he homes in on the guy with
Superhuman Senses - d10). Since DDevil has a distinction of "Protector of
Hell's Kitchen", he can either add a d8 or a d4 to the roll. The bad guy has to
beat his roll (or if the bad guy rolled first, DD has to beat the bad guy's
roll). DD would roll d8 + d10 + d10 + d4 and a PP (or d8 and no PP). He keeps
the best two and adds them together. If he's using his Radar Sense SFX, he can
spend a PP to roll a d12 instead of a d10 for Superhuman Sense, and can reroll
everything.

Doom Pool looks like Smallville RPG, where the GM has a dice of pool that he
uses to roll minor and environmental die stuff: things where there is no one
specific opponent, like the mugger above as a minor threat. Or DDevil saving
someone from a burning building. But if DDevil were fighting Dr. Octopus, then
Doc Ock would have his own various die rolls.

That's first impressions. More later.

Okay, looking at the player summary sheet, I was pretty much correct. Which is
the advantage of playign the Cortex system: once you've played one or two, you
have a pretty grasp of all of them.

So on your turn you can attack; recover (damage is represented by dice that
your opponent gets to roll), take a support action to give your best dice to an
ally; or roll against another characte.

So when you take an action, you declare your intent. Build your dice pool.
Spend PPs. Roll dice. Set aside anything that is a one. Add together the best
two. Choose a third die as your "effect die" Spend PPs again. The Wacher gives
you a PP for every 1 that you rolled and puts that dice into his Doom Pool. See
who wins.

Your pool consists of your: Affiliation, 1-Distinction, 1-Power from _each_ o
of your Power Sets, 1-Specialty, 1 of your opponent's stress or complication
dice, 1-Asset (??), and 1 Push, Stunt, or Resource (again ??).

The effect dice inflicts stress, or tamper with assets (good temporary thigns
the players get when the GM rolls a 1), or tamper with complications. Or you
give the dice to an ally if you took a support action. Or removes you or an
ally's stress dice if you did a recovery action.

Plot points can be used to: add a d6 push die (??), add in another trait (i.e.,
Daredevil uses Blind Justice and Protector of Hell's Kitchen), add a stunt dice
(??) at d8, or a d10 if the "opportunity came from the Watcher's roll (??). Or
activate one of those SFXs mentioned earlier.  Or add in a stress dice that you
have to your die roll.

You can also spend a PP to add in more dice, or keep an extra dice on top of
the two "free" ones you add together. Or activate 1s that your Watcher rolled.

You can also "add a resource die linked to a Specialty (??).

You start with 1 PP a sesson and get them for using your Distinction at D4,
activating a limit on a Power Set, or you rolled 1s and the Watcher gives you a
PP to add those dice to his doom patrol.

Got it? Good...  :)

Marvel continued:

The first 20 pages go into a bit more detail about what I described above.

One thing I like is that the doom pool is variable. In Smallville, it always
started the night at 2d6. that's what it starts at here, but that's just for a
"standard" adventure. It scales upward depending on how tough the adventure is.
A Cosmic Scale event with Catastrophic Stakes means the DoomPool starts at
4d10.

You don't "steal" the die that a player rolls on a 1 to add to your Doom Pool.
You get a d6 if they rolled a 1 and you pay them a PP. If they roll 2 1s, you
get a d8 (still only paying 1 PP). And so on. Villains can also use their
effect dice by putting it into the Doom Pool, rather than hurting the heroes
(taking hostages, shooting gas tanks,and other obnoxious indirect stuff).

The GM spends die from the Doom Pool the way that players spend Plot Points. to
add extra dice to their roll, keep additional dice,and activate villain SFXs.
And some other stuff, like splitting off a hero from a group (changing the
affiliation).

The GM uses the doom pool when it's necessary tod etermine a generic poool of
opposition. Natural forces, sheer luck, and so on.

Marvel Heroic: Creating characters.


Characters are "datafiles."

You assign a d6, d8, and d10 to affiliations: Solo,  Buddy, and team.

You get three Distinctions. catchphrases, backgrounds, and professions are
distinctions. They should be things that could be detrimental as well as
helpful for you, since you'll choose rather to pick the d4 (and a PP) = bad. Or
the d8 = good. "Protector of Hell's Kitchen" mentioned above could mean you're
dedicated to the area, or your distracted by neighborhood problems.

Power Sets: This section is really, really vague. You have summarize the poewrs
in one or two "packages." There seems to be no rules on what dice to give each
attribute within the package. Basically it's "Look at what we already created,
and don't do anything unbalancing." Ugh. I also smell "Future power-creation
rules in an expansion." There are some powersets earlier in the book, about
15-20.

Specialties are either Master/d10 or Expert/d8. Again choose what you think
your charavter should have as far as quantity. Captain America has one Master
and 4 Experts.

Milestones, create what you want.

So I'm... not too impressed with character creation.

system. But as isn't totally surprising, the RPG is designed for relatively
short term "Events." Rather than a full blown year after year after year
ongoing campaign. You play Civil War, or Secret Wars, or Skrull Invasion, and
then you're done. Create new characters (or bring back your previous ones, but
they're pretty much "reset") for the next Event.

Naturally, there's a few people on the Margaret Weis forum who are basically of
the, "Well, yea, just create whatever you want, give them whatever stats you
want and what your fellow players will let you" mentality. So your mileage may
vary.

Anyhoo, there are some interesting variations from Smallville and/or Leverage.
There aren't back-and-forth contests anymore. You roll a total, your opponent
rolls a reaction total. Take the two dice you prefer and add them together,
they do the same. Attacker has to beat the reaction roll.

If you don't beat the reaction roll, then that's it and play moves onto th
next character. In Smallville, you'd keep rolling back and forth until someone
gave in or failed.

The new mechanic is the _third_ dice you keep from your roll. That's your
effect dice. It represents how much damage you do to your opponent (damage is
measured in die types, and Physical, Mental, or Emotional depending on the type
of conflict. Your opponent does the same thing. If his effect dice is higher,
yours is knocked down one step (a d6 to a d4). For every five points you rolled
above your opponent, you kick your die type up a step.

What if the reactor roll 5 or more higher than the attacker? He already made
the attacker miss, right? The reactor can still spend a Plot Point and impose
an "effect" on the attacker equal to the effect die. So if Cyclops blasts a
Sentinel and the Sentinel rolls five more than Cyclops' roll to defend, he can
take that d6 effect die, make it a d8, and say it's (for instance ) FALLING
CEILING DEBRIS D8. For the rest of the battle, that Sentinel gets an extra d8
to roll against Cyclops when falling ceiling debris would hinder Cyclops.

Damage is also an "effect" (or effects are a type of damage, take your pick).
So if Cyclops gets a d8 effect dice on the roll against the Sentinel, he
declares it Physical stress, and Cyclops (and anyone else attacking the
Sentinel) gets that extra d8 in their pool.

It's an interesting mix of primarily Smallville and some Leverage tossed in.
Like most systems, it's easier to learn by example than by reading.

Mavel Heroic: In any case, the rest of it is relatively minor stuff. A lot of
it boils down to various ways to get extra dice in the form of "Stunts" and
"Resources." So for instance, during Transition Scenes, you can use your
Specialities (Military, Psych, Meance, Computer, Acrobatic) to make a roll to
get a resource (Computer Tech d8), that you could then use for future computer
rolls in the Event.

Since you already have a lot of dice (Affiliation, plus Distinction, plus
Specialty, plus one die roll per Power Set you have (1-2), plus any stress dice
your opponent has, plus any asset, plus any power SFX that give you more or
extra dice (some of them let you take one dice and break it into two of the
next die type down, 1d10 = 2d8), it seems like overkill.

After that you get a started Event, "Breakout," which recreates the first story
arc of the New Avengers under Bendis (breakout at the Raft, trip to the Savage
Land). It's pretty much a straight bunch of fighting. There's stats on what
seem like 20-30 villains confined at the Raft, and then the Savage Mutates.
Then you have two page spreads on 23 heroes: the usual bunch, but also Sentry
(who isn't powerful as you'd think someone with "The Power of a Million
Exploding Suns" would be (6 different d10 dice, no "Godlike" d12s)).

An adventure is an "Event," although a big story arc can be multiple Events. So
Breakout is a one-event, two-act adventure with 3-4 action scenes per act.
Estimated to take 2 sessions to play. As noted earlier, there are "milestones"
that you build for your character, rated at 1-3-10 XP. With the 10th milestone
being some big life-changing decision that doesn't necessarily go well for your
character either way (Sentry 10xp: either "when you either leave the
battlefield to avoid actviating the Void or accept an offer to join a team
after activating the Void." + "when you either first activate the Void and aid
in defeating it or you activate the Void and sacrifice yourelf to prevent it
from harming others.")

Events can also have their own milestones that anyone can choose instead of one
of their two. there's limits on how often you can use each milestone, like
once per scene or once per act or once per Event.

And that's it. Basically a combination of the Cortex rules for Smallville and
Leverage. It's more detailed than either of those, and allows for more varation
because of the addition of the Effect Dice. There's no character generation
system and the only game balance in character creation is "If you creaet a hero
with D12 in every power, your friends are going to give you that look. You know
the one."

There's also no real rules for long-term character advancement, but that's
deliberate on the part of the designer. Their market research indicates that
most people don't play long-term campaigns. Me, I'd prefer to see support for
both, but that seems to be a lost cause.


Is it the best Marvel RPG of the four? I suppose, although I have a fondness
for the SAGA system. It seems more suited to con events and other one-shot or
short-term get-togethers.

In the eternal competition between DC and Marvel RPGs, I'm hard put to say
which is better. I like the current Mutants & Mastermind variation for DC
Adventures, but I find parts of it way too complex to introduce to a beginner,
or a comic book fan who just wants to play their favorite superhero. Marvel
Heroic wins narrowly on that score. I think it has a quicker learning curve:
once you grasp the basics in an hour or so, that's it and you're set for life
without having to flip through the rules every half hour (Hello, DCA Advantages
and a number of the powers--I'm talking to you!). I suspect the lack of detail
may be offputting to the experienced gamer, though. "So, all my Cyclops force
blast does is give me an extra d10 to roll and a few SFX?"


Heh. I was looking at Cyclops and would note that yep, they really want these
to be short-term campaigns. One of Cyclop's 10-xp milestones is "when yo either
lead your team to victory or disband them in the face of prosecution." Captain
America's involves either giving up leadership of his team, or the second one
is disband your existing team. So you actually get rewarded for disbanding your
team.

Oh well, caveat emptor. Any questions, let me know.

Marvel Heroic: For another review...

In fairness, he's incorrect on at leaste one thing: you can only invoke a
milstone once per Event. So there's no "Do the 10 XP milesetone, then turn
around and do it again" option.

I also don't recall being as fond of the original Marvel/FASERIP system as he
claims anyone, ever, is. Or that the Cortex system is as revised as he claims.

But yes, there is a lot of dice manipulation in the game. Roll your pool, the
GM buys your opportunities, you keep two totaled dice and a third effect dice,
other rolls give you dice for your future rolls, and so on.

Also, did I miss a memo somehwere? I hated the TSR Marvel FASERIP system. It
didn't even have a character creation system until either 2nd Ed or the
Ultimate Powers Book. And it was a basic "I hit, you hit" system. There wasn't
any room for maneuvers, and while you could kinda/sorta tweak your die roll
(with... Karma?), that tended to cut into your experience as I recall. That's
not the first game to do that, with XP as both XP and a game alteration
mechanic, but it was rarely worth it to boost your die roll up into the next
color column, particularly if you rolled low in the preceding color. (i.e., if
Green was 20-50 and you needed Yellow at 51, rolling a 20 wasn't worth spending
31 Karma, but someone who rolled a 50 had an advantage and only needed to spend
1 Karma.)

I'm designing an RPG system to eventually build an on-line game around, and my
general theory is to take advantage of the AI ability of computers to create a
"sandbox" RPG environment.  I'm posting here because the video game element
isn't really what I want to talk about, but rather the system itself.

I want it to be a skill-based system, no levels, no classes, and trainers are
optional if you want to advance more quickly.  Your character acquires skills
by using them.  Pick a dagger, start stabbing things, gain experience with
dagger.  Start hammering metal and gain experience with blacksmithing, etc.

To facilitate this, I envisioned a very large and somewhat complex "skill tree"
with dependencies, pre-requisites, etc, so that you can get access to more
powerful skills only after mastering simpler skills.  You can't cast "fireball"
until you're adept with "flame touch," for example (not a real example, just to
give you an idea).

Where I am agonizing is over the degree of complexity.  Personally, I like a
*BIG* game with a ton of options that I can explore indefinitely and always
have more yet to try, but the trend in game design seems to be away from that
kind of play and toward simpler and streamlined systems.

Here's a good example.  I want to have skills have a "knowledge" and a "skill"
component.  Let's take herbalism as an example:

  + Herbalism
  |
  o-- Botany
  |
  o-- Cultivation

Your character's "Botany" skill in herbalism would dictate what he knows about
herbalism, and "cultivation" would have to do with actually growing plants and
harvesting the important pieces successfully.  These are two different skills,
you might know a ton about something (e.g., car engines) but have no clue how
to actually repair or build one.  The "knowledge" component would determine the
things your character may attempt to do -- you can't try to do something unless
you know that it's out there to be done. The "skill" component would determine
your success rate.  That is, you would gain access to new "recipes" or "moves"
or "spells" by increasing the knowledge piece, but the skill piece determines
your success rate.

Part of why I like this is that I want to incorporate an Eve-like skill
advancement system where you can "study" subejct matter while off-line to gain
experience while not playing.  Here, the character could check out a book on
botany from the library and, when you log off, your character studies it and
gains knowledge in botany, giving the player the sense that they're
accomplishing somethinge even while not playing.  Each book would have a limit
to how much can be learned from it ... e.g., "Botany 7th Ed." could take you up
to level 7, after that you've got to find another book or a trainer.

But characters could also gain experience by writing their own books and
donating them to libraries.  I had the idea that the book would be named after
the character, with the edition being the skill cap.  So if you've got level 11
in Botany and your character is Dorkmire, you'd be able to write, "Dorkmire on
Botany, 11th Ed" and other players could check it out to learn from it.
Writing the book would give you some skill points but also this would gradually
create a large library of materials for players to pick from, etc.

Anyway.... my main question is whether this kind of system would be appealing.
I'm not going for any particular audience, I guess, other than people who want
to play a relatively free-form game where they can go out and do almost
anything they want.  Sort of like early Ultima On-Line only with more player-
friendly guidance and protection to help you get started.

So, I put it to you: more complexity/bigger skill tree, or less?

How well is an individual going to be able to develop each given tree? Is the
player limited to a certain number of points or skill imporvements and has to
divvy them up judiciously, OR is the player going to ultimately be maxxed out
in every single skill in the game? Either way can work of course and both have
advantages and disadvantages. But depending on which direction you choose to
take, that might have a bearing on how complex you might make it. For instance
with your example: Herbalism: Basic botany, medicinal herbs, nutritional herbs,
 magical herbs, tinctures, infusions, essential oils, storage. Thats highly
complex. Your original idea as presented somewhat less so.

  No limit, but it's impossible to "max out."  You can always improve with
  a skill, it just becomes increasingly difficult.  Skills are improved by
  using them, you have "experience" in each skill.  For example, when you
  swing your sword at somebody with a Dodge skill of 8, you gain 8 experience
  with your sword skill.

  As long as you keep using the skill, you'll get better at it, but at some
  point it's faster to develop magical items to augment then skill than to
  improve it naturally.

I, too, would like to hear some opinions of anyone who has played the DnD Next

Preferably, I'd like to view it as a pure discussion on the merits of the new

edition is better than your edition.

That is so incredibly played out. And senselss to bother posting or reading.

WoTC are simply going to put out a new edition of DnD every 5-10 years. Why? to
make money. Because they are a company. And they will always make a far bigger
fortune on a new system core books than they can with modules and additional
sourcebooks. Its a pure financial reasoning.

So, if we can not get caught up in the unfairness of capitalism, I'd love to

I've playtested D&D Next twice now. It's not bad. With some of the ideas
they're bandying about, it might even end up being great. The idea behind it is
that they want it to be modular. So if you're a fan of first edition, you can
use just the bare minimum rules and be happy. But you can add on rules as you
see fit, so it can be a lot more complex. Mind you, I haven't seen any of that,
as the playtest just gives you a character and the Caves of Chaos and lets you
have at it.
It's a lot more fun than 4th Edition, though (which, while not great, was never
as bad as some people were painting it). Combat is quicker and your characters
feel more unique. Combat's actually quicker than almost any of the other
editions. But I cannot go into specifics, as I had to sign an NDA.

  I always liked wizards.  Whoever designed AD&D2 *hated* mages.  I never got a
mage past level 1 unless the DM Cheated for me, because the game goes like
this:

  Cast sleep and/or magic missile.

  Do nothing but avoid being seen for the rest of the day.  Study spellbook.

  If anything even got within spitting distance, I would probably die, because
  I have 1d4 hit points.  I'd max out my DEX and CON after INT if at all
  possible just to add some armor class and add a few hp.  My best mage had
  18 CON, 17 DEX, and 17 INT.  Got to level 5 only because the DM kept
  cheating to keep me alive. "But your tanks/fighters shuld be helping you
  with that!"  They can't.  I have enough hit points to survive zero (0)
  attacks from even a level 1 NPC.

  D&D 3 was better, to some extent, but I just hated the D&D spell system.
  Having to memorize everything up front and then pick and choose...

Any more news on the playtest front?  I love Pathfinder but I am quite curious
about the new D&D.  4th edition was (putting it very mildly) a HUGE
disappointment to me and my friends.  I would like to see something reviving my
old, fond love of D&D and just pretend that 4th edition never happened (like
New Coke).

They've released several a couple of chunks as of late, adding magic items and
expanding their initial class info to 10 levels.

So far I like it. It seems fairly informed by 2nd Ed with a lighter version of
3rd's Feats. The additions of dis/advantage still work well for me and it looks
like rogues have the expertise option that fighters had in the initial
playtest, though there's are aimed a bit more at their skills.

The differences for specialist wizards seem quite workable and relatively
streamlined with clerics having some interesting options, as well.

4th ed wasn't ignored, though, as the term at-will is still in play and they do
use a varied rest system. However, it feels like 4th ed has only had a modicum
of impact on D&D Next.

Two of the best things about 4E were that everyone's character could make
everyone else look good (it wasn't all about damage-per-round, like 3E and
certainly 2E were) and it was almost as interesting playing a non-spellcaster
as playing a spellcaster.

If D&D Next loses those, then it's a step down right out of the gate, in my
book at least.

I think the non-spellcaster classes are on par with the spellcaster classes
from what I've seen.

Interestingly enough, the advantage mechanic has kind of a rule of thumb: if
you take an action to set up another action then that second action likely has
advantage. So, teamwork can definitely have a mechanic effect beyond the old
"aid another" action.

I must admit that I didn't see as much in the way of boosting others as 4E used
to, but my memory is fuzzy regarding 4E since it's been a while since I've
touched it.

If you give me an example of something you saw in 4E that did what you're
talking about, Forrester, I'll do my best to compare it to the playtest
materials I have on hand.

The fantastic thing about 4E, in my opinion, was the leader/striker/battlefield
manipulator interaction among the character classes. It wasn't a bunch of peopl
e pairing off with monsters -- I mean, that might happen, but combat was much
richer. Just having combat be such that you can have some generic +2 bonuses
added on for being supportive, not sure that'll cut it.

Re fighters: in 2E and 3E, fighters were mostly about just hack-hack-hack. And
their strength was pretty much just a function of their magic items -- a 12th
level fighter with regular stuff was pretty much like an equipped 7th level
fighter.

Is that different in D&D Next? Are fighters more like 2E fighters, 3E fighters,
or 4E fighters?

Well, they seem to have stepped back a bit from the clearly defined roles - at
least in vocabulary.

But I've seen plenty of groups do what 4E pushed with the tight combat role
definitions in other editions just because it made tactical sense.

Still, you might be disappointed as the system itself doesn't seem to push for
those specific role types.

Fighters are definitely more 4E, but not with magical effects coming out the
wazoo. Their maneuvers should put them on par with combat spellcasters, but
have descriptions that match a non-magical combatant. The maneuvers look like
they should give the fighter some options to be both a bit more interesting
while still putting a beatdown on opponents.

Run it.  Carefully and slowly at first.  You will grow to see its brilliance.

Make sure you use the combat system, which I resisted at first.  It makes
combat actually strategic, and it isn't hard to figure out once you try it a
few times.

It's one of those systems that seems complicated in print but runs really,
really smoothly once you get going.  Although it definitely helps to have
players who are clever.

I haven't played Shadowrun since 2000 or so, but it was a lot of fun.

In a conversation with a colleague recently, he brought up D&D; I mentioned
that I used to play it all the time, but was now a first edition purist and
refused to play anything else.(1)  His eyes lit up and said he was the same
way.  The end result is that next week he's running one of the old module
campaigns and I'm in!  Looking forward to it.

(1)  The only real reason for this is that I first learned on first edition,
having started playng AD&D when I was six or so.  By the time subsequent
editions started coming out, I had all the tables and such memorized and I
didn't want to have to learn everything all over again.  I'm sure my colleague
is in the same situation, and he's probably 20 years older than I am.

Every so often I will break out my 1st Ed D&D and run games for people at a
local gaming store.  It really does have a much different flow and feel from
more modern incarnations.  On the one hand, the rules aren't as, "versatile,"
in terms of combat and such.  However, everyone always seems to get a little
more into the story of the game somehow.  There is something to be said about
relative simplicity.

Well, it looks like Catalyst has run out of their latest print run of their
Player's guide and they are scrambling to get more out as quick as they can.  I
guess my observations were not too far off of the mark.  Catalyst must have
kicked their marketing into gear or something.  Shadowrun is everywhere around
gaming stores these days and tons of kids are getting into it.  I must admit, I
am surpirsed (and glad).

and running a Pathfinder game on the alternate weeks where the players have
been on a series of (mis)adventures and (yes) did just finish a dungeon crawl.
But, they enjoyed it.

As the characters in my game are now hitting about 10th level I am going to
have them earn a few titles and get a little land between Cheliax and Andoran
and run a bit of a "Birthright" style of game where the players get to
accumulate and dispense with some resources from trade and temples and such and
deal with some of the politics in the area...as well as go destroy monsters, of
course and get loot, of course.

I have also been getting to play Shadowrun Missions twice a month.  I am really

And the Redskins beat the Cowboys.  They win the NFC East and set up what
should be a fantastic matchup of Russell Wilson vs RGIII next Sunday.

Anyway, now that everything is 100% set, here's my playoff predictions:

AFC
#6 Cincinnati d. #3 Houston, #5 Indianapolis d. #4 Baltimore
#1 Denver d. #6 Cincinnati, #2 New England d. #5 Indianapolis
#1 Denver d. #2 New England

NFC
#3 Green Bay d. #6 Minnesota, #4 Washington d. #5 Seattle
#4 Washington d. #1 Atlanta, #2 San Francisco d. #3 Green Bay
#4 Washington d. #2 San Francisco

Super Bowl XLVII
Denver d. Washington

These are the two hottest teams in the league.  Denver has a clear path with
home-field advantage, and I believe that Griffin can win anywhere with that
offense.

It should be noted that this is the 25th anniversary of Super Bowl XXII, when
Denver and Washington last met in a Super Bowl.  That was the only Super Bowl
ever won by a black quarterback -- Washington's Doug Williams.  I can't
possibly be the only one who wouldn't be surprised if Griffin becomes the 2nd,
whether it's this year or otherwise very, very soon.

I'll agree, I think Chicago did well this year, and it wasn't that long ago

me, Smith has missed the playoffs too many times in the last few years. He can
get Cinderella the dress and the slippers but still can't get her to the ball

He'll easily pick up a job elsewhere, likely with another NFL team, and I say

coaching job than he did this season when they in reality went 10-6. But, "he

But, it's also comparitive. We know that the team could go to the SuperBowl as
they've been there once. So, when you only make it to the playoffs 5 of 6
seasons, and have epic collapses in some of them, it's not going to bode well.

It's the same thing with Philly. You know what the capability is there, and
when you fall short so often, it's seen as being a lot worse. But, to both
teams credit, they gave their coaches *plenty* of time and opportunities.

Not to mention, Lovie had already been there since 2004.  Sometimes it's good
to have a change for change's sake, since the Bears have not looked strong hte
last two seasons (even with this season's 10 win record).  Limping along with
an above average record is not the same as getting consistent conference
championship appearances (a la New England).

I do agree though that Lovie can easily get a new job at one of the 6 vacancies
if he actually wanted to work there.  Out of all the openings, I don't feel
that any of them are just a head coach away from success.  Between personel
issues and the front office TBD, they all look like they're still DOA for 2013.

Here's a question that just occured to me (but probably isn't original, too
lazy to google):

A player has the ball and breaks the goal line plane by extending the ball over
the goal line, but is hit and his body lands out of bounds. That is a

touchdown.


By that same logic, why is it not a touchdown if a player in the end zone leaps
up an catches the ball, but is knocked out of bounds? At the momen the ball is
caught, it has broken the end zone plane. As long as the player maintains
control of the ball as he goes out of bounds and hits the ground, seems like it
would be subject to the same rule.

Pretty much, yeah. If the same play with the receiver happened on say the 30
yard line, he'd be ruled out of bounds because part of making a catch is coming
down with both feet inbounds while maintaining possession. In your example of
what IS a touchdown, the runner has already broken the plane of the goal while
he had "possession" of the ball.

It looks like a double standard to me.

In the first example, what is important is if the ball broke the goal line
plane, and whether or not his body lands in the plane is not relevent. In the
second example, it is not relevent if the ball breaks the goal line plane,
whether or not his body lands in the plane is important.

KAM, here's the difference, with abbreviations noted below:

CATCH!! fp,fp,fp,fp,fp,fp,bbp,ko,TD!

CATCH!! bbp,ko.

fb = football play.  A "football move."  The key indicator of possession or not
is whether a football move is made.
bbp = ball breaks plane.  Where the ball is in regards to the boundaries of the
end zone.
ko = knocked out of bounds.
TD = touchdown.

When there are football moves between the catch and being knocked out of
bounds, and one of those football moves involves the ball breaking the plane of
the end zone, there is a touchdown.

When there are NO football moves between the catch and being knocked out of
bounds, even if the catch is made dead smack in the middle of the end zone,
there is NO touchdown.

KAM>  First, your question.  It's not a double standard.  In your second
example, possession isn't established if you catch the ball with both feet in
the air -- possession is only established when you have caught the ball AND
both feet are on the ground.

The "break the plan of the goal line" only applies if you have possession of
the ball as defined by the rules.  The rules of a catch are the same no matter
where the catch is -- you would only have a double standard if the rules for a
catch in the end zone were somewhat different than anywhere else.

It should also be noted that, if you go to the ground as part of making the
catch, possession is only established if you maintain control of the ball
through the entire motion.  If you hit the ground and the ball comes out, it's
no catch.

Second, RG3.  Have you seen him play?  He was clearly affected -- he could
barely run and was noticeably limping/in pain, and his throws were nowhere near
as crisp or accurate as they were in other games.  As tonight's game wore on,
many of his throws sailed high of their intended targets -- specifically
because he could not plant normally and drive into the throw.

As for the running part, there were multiple examples tonight of Griffin taking
the quickest route to the sideline.  Normally, he'd seek open lanes to get as
many yards as possible.

It's pretty easy to compare RGIII's and the offense's first quarter stats to

tweaking that injured knee on the second drive, the wheels steadily started
falling off.
There is, of course, the eye test - I don't know what game you were watching,
KAM, but watching RGIII hobble around on attempted bootlegs in the second half
was painful to see-- there wasn't anything that he could do that the backup
couldn't also do.

III should have come outof the game after he huhrt himself without even being
hit in the late first/early 2nd quarter.

However, even while I was watching the game, I didn't think he should leave the
game until I saw hime have a wife open field to run in and only made about 8
yeards with his face looking like every single step was killing him.

What bother me more is that RGIII sayign in interviews something to the
effect of he had to be a man and there was no way he was coming out of that
game. While I appreciate that for him, the coaches might have needed to
step in there. Obviously Shanahan thought RGIII should still be out there.
I think they should have put COusins out there. of course, they probably
still would not have won.

RG3 pretty much said that he was basically avoiding reality.  I hadn't realized
it, but he had torn his ACL during college before.  So his response to the
reporter's question about if it felt like an ACL tear was kinda frightening:
Asked after the game if he thought he might have torn his right ACL --
something he did in college and therefore knows how it feels -- Griffin said,
"Honestly, it's up in the air for me right now."

What really concerns me about RG3 is that he's got a true warrior's mentality.
While laudable, that means his coaches need to give him an incredibly short
leash regarding injury.  If he even looks bad, you'll need to take him out. 
Moreso when you factor his size.

It's also the -same- -knee- that he injured in college. With that in mind, he
should have rode the bench the remainder of the regular season - even if it
could have meant missing the playoffs (to be fair, I think Cousins could have
beat the Cowboys, too, but it wouldn't have been as decisions - more like a 3
point game as opposed to 10).

They've risked his career to try to get into the playoffs and MAYBE get one win
out of 'em. Dumb move.

RG3 is a lot like Ben Roethlisberger in that area.  He's the type of guy that
wants to play, no matter what, out of devotion to his team...and he needs to be
protected from himself by a coaching and medical staff that should know better.

As the game wore on last night, I thought of last year's MNF game in San
Francisco where Roethlisberger tried to play on a severely sprained ankle. 
Like Griffin last night (after the first 2 drives), he was able to do a few
things...but generally, he showed little confidence in the ankle and it
drastically affected his play.

And for Washington, what makes this worse is that you have a capable backup
that has already put up 38 points on a pretty good Browns defense (on the road)
and helped finish off a win over Baltimore -- a guy presumably drafted
specifically for situations like this.  I can't fathom that they didn't have
enough faith in Cousins to put him in the game...he's already shown he's good
enough to win.

I'll close by saying that, while Shanahan bears a lot of responsibility for
this (esp. if that ACL is torn), Dan Snyder bears much responsibility, too. 
The playing surface was a train wreck.  You could expect something like that
from a decades-old stadium 20 or 30 years ago...but in a new stadium in 2012,
it's absolute negligence to put teams on a field like that.  Besides hurting
Griffin, it may have also caused Seattle to lose a key defensive lineman for
the year, too.

I think the NFL has to step in for situations like this.  Either the NFL should
examine the field days enough in advance that the game can be moved if the
field is too poor, or it should be punitive by either taking away a future home
game or by issuing fines in the 7-figure range.  Any of those, which would hit
the owner in the pocketbook, ought to be incentive enough to force them to take
care of their stadiums.

ESPN's Michael Smith made a good point on Twitter this afternoon.  He opined
that you can't argue against Bonds and Clemens if you don't also do the same
for anyone that played before baseball was integrated.

And he has a point.  While it's true that not all good players are/were black
and that not all black players are/were good, their absence from the game
before 1947 CLEARLY impacted that statistical landscape.  There's no way to
quantify it, of course...but it would be ridiculous to infer that things
wouldn't have been different if Babe Ruth had faced black pitchers or if Walter
Johnson had to face black hitters.

With steroids, it's incredibly problematic...because you have very few guys who
are known to be cheaters without a shadow of a doubt.  And even if you did
know, guys like Bonds complicate things further.  Bonds was a Hall of Fame
player WITHOUT PEDs, pre-1999.  Roger Clemens probably was, too.

And neither the Baseball Hall of Fame or the BBWAA is helping.  Jayson Stark
wrote a wonderful column about his vote.  He's one of the guys that votes for
the "cheaters", and he discusses how that has caused the ballot to become
backlogged to the point where he now has to choose guys to leave off...because
the ballot has a limit.  You can only vote for 10 guys.

But it appears that there is a significant percentage of current writers who
will NEVER vote for a cheater...enough to probably keep most, if not all, of th
the suspected group out.  The Hall needs to do something about it...either tell
voters that steroids are off the table, as far as voting criteria goes, or take
the known cheats off the ballot.

That backlog gets worse next year, too.  These guys will be on the ballot for
the first time next year: Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, Frank Thomas, Mike Mussina,
Jeff Kent, Luis Gonzalez, and Moises Alou.

Good luck with that, voters.

Or figure this, dianabol was clearly in use in the NFL by 1963 and widespread
use by 1968. Baseball is clearly a sport that benefits from steroid use far
more than other sports (due to the long season). It seems highly unlikely that
any player did -not- use steroids from the time of the Mexico City Olympics to
1981 when steroids required prescriptions. And even from 1981 to 1988 (when
unauthorized use was finally illegalized), a pro athlete would have no problem
at all getting a prescription and then could obtain steroids from any source
they wanted.
Considerign the era when Jack Morris played, that would seem to make it
extremely unlikely that he did not use steroids. (And start throwing in
corticol steroids, amphetamines, and other performancing enhancing drugs
besides androgens and anabolics, and it is simply impossible that any playe
rform the late 70s did not use performancing enhancing drugs.)

I have little patience for the "He LOOKS like a HoFer" argument, which is all
this boils down to. The only statistic on his favor--wins--is pretty well
explained by the fact that he was on a lot of really good teams.

Most above-average pitchers in Jack Morris' position would have about as many
wins. That's what his ERA suggests, as well as other metrics.

Of all people, I think Bob Gibson might eventually rock everything wide open.
The writers continue to ignore the clear evidence that Gibson used PEDs, and
Gibson keeps hinting that he likely used steroids (when you consider the timing
of his career and comments he has made that he woudl have used them if
available; they were readily available).
Seems that some day the writers will piss Gibson off enough, and he will be old

As far as Jack Morris goes, I look at it like this -- if it's all going to be
nothing more than a "numbers" game, then why even have voters?  Just establish
statistical standards that include adjustments for league and park factors.

But if not, then I don't understand the mocking of the "eye test".  Did Morris
have the best stuff or the best numbers?  No.  But his dogged determination and
sheer reliability...the sheer force of will he showed on the mound...made him
an ace in ways that numbers simply couldn't.

From 1980 to 1992, Morris pitched at least 235 innings and 34 starts in all but
TWO years.  And one of those two years was the strike-shortened 1981 season.

Maybe his "intangibles" don't quite get him to Cooperstown, but anyone
dismissing him just because of his numbers is doing Morris and incredible
disservice.

Cyanide: I don't know what pitches he was throwing? Why the hell would I care?
I don't care if he has fifteen pitches, one of which writes his name in curves
on the way to the hitter, if they don't actually make him more effective.

SA:

I think that's fair, to a point. I tend to think, for example, that he was
actually better than a 105 ERA+, because of what he did in big games, in the
postseason, and because of the durability you cite.

But especially in the eyes of a homer like Cyanide, it gets completely out of
hand. When he's winning World Series (with fantastic run support and a
world-class defense behind him with people like Trammell and Whitaker), it's
easy to project a greatness on him that's not really there.

Step>  Oh, I agree.  And I'm not denying that Jack Morris had numbers that
would cause people to think twice about his Hall candidacy.  Against guys like
Schilling (this year) and Maddux and Glavine (next year), he just doesn't stack
up numbers-wise.

My point is simply that a player's greatness can be as much about how he lifts
up his teammates and makes them better as it is about his numbers. 
Specifically with pitchers, I would argue that being an "ace" is being like an
"MVP"...numbers are important, but they're not everything.

I'd also note that many writers in the late 80s made very similar arguments
against Nolan Ryan -- that his numbers (300 wins, 5000+ Ks) were as much about
his longevity as about his greatness.  His number of losses (nearly 300) and
his huge walk totals were definitely cited.  It was only over the last few
years of his career, when he threw multiple no-hitters and became a
larger-than-life figure, that those arguments went away.

I've got a book somwhere, I think written by Thomas Boswell, that discusses
this.

Personally, I don't know if he's worthy, but it's going to be very
disappointing to see him get this close and not get in, if he doesn't get the
vote next year.  It's not like Dale Murphy, who was a borderline candidate but
nver got much of a vote.  Morris would have gotten excruciatingly close.  And
the fact that many writers are politicizing these ballots (some by not voting
for anyone) makes it worse -- it's arguable that his candidacy could be
derailed as collateral damage.

Unfortunately, with Glavine and Maddux both on the ballot next year and
Schilling as a worthy candidate himself...I think it's unlikely that Morris
makes that last jump from 67 to 75% of the vote.  Worthy or not, that's just
sad.

But there also has to be reasonable suspicion.

In the other game...not sure who I'm rooting for.  I expect the Patriots to win

had to learn something from the undressing they got in Foxboro several weeks

In any event, it's pretty impressive that both Harbaughs have led their teams
to conference championship games in each of the last 2 years.  In fact, those
two now have a combined 7 years of coaching in the NFL -- and have never missed
the playoffs.  They will now have 5 conference championship game appearances in
those 7 years with a combined playoff record of 9-5.

Unfortunately, the duo is 0-3 to date in those conference championship games. 
They'll break through, though...and this might well be the year.

Interesting dynamic for next week's championship games illustrates the
difference between the NFC and AFC.

In the NFC, regardless of who wins (49ers or Falcons), the winner will be the
9th different team to represent the NFC in the last 10 Super Bowls.  Only the
Giants have had more than one NFC title in that span.

And if the 49ers win, they'll be the 12th different NFC champion in the last 15
years.  In THAT span, only the Giants (3) and Rams (2) have more than 1 NFC
title.

Aside from the 49ers, the only NFC teams that haven't been to the Suepr Bowl in
the last 15 seasons are the Cowboys, Redskins, Lions and Vikings.

In the AFC, a Patriots' win over the Ravens would make this the 10th straight
year that the AFC champ has been either New England, Indianapolis, or
Pittsburgh.  Obviously, the only QBs to rep the AFC in the Super Bowl during
this time have been Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger.

But even if Baltimore wins, they've kind of been a "4th wheel" of sorts, as
they're going to their 3rd AFC title game in 5 seasons.

In fact, the Patriots, Steelers, Colts and Ravens have accounted for 16 of the
20 spots in the last 10 AFC Championship games.  The other 12 teams in the
conference -- combined -- have accounted for 4 (Jets 2, Chargers 1, Broncos 1).

NFL / Championship Weekend>

49ers at Falcons (3:00pm ET)
Colin Kaepernick has convinced me that this stage won't affect him, which is
good for SF.  Whether it's leading his team to a 31-3 lead and then winning the
game after that lead disappears in the elements at New England, or putting up
45 points on Green Bay after throwing a pick-6 on his first drive last week,
Kaepernick has met his biggest challenges with his best play.

His game earlier this year in New Orleans is also a benefit, because he's got
experience with the kind of noise he'll face on Sunday in the Georgia Dome.

Based on Zach Miller's 8 catch, 142 yard, 1 TD performance last week, I
anticipate a big game from Vernon Davis.  If Crabtree can make a couple of
plays and Gore can run the ball decently the Niners will score plenty of
points.

For the Falcons, my biggest question on them is how they'll follow up their 1st
playoff win as a current group.  This is also the 1st NFC championship game
ever played in Atlanta.  They can play loose, because the pressure of getting
that first win is off...but I wonder if the 49ers might have more urgency
because of their loss in the NFC title game last year.

If anyone's going to make a killer mistake, I think it'll be the Falcons.  They
really shouldn't have escaped last week, and the 49ers are great at making (and
capitalizing on) errors by other teams.

Ultimately, I think...49ers 34, Falcons 24

Ravens at Patriots (6:30pm ET)
Obviously, the two big story lines in this game are Ray Lewis and his possible
last game for the Ravnes, and Belichick/Brady seeking again to join Noll and
Bradshaw as the only coach/QB combo to ever win 4 Super Bowls.

The Ravens occupy this year's "team of destiny" roll...and over the last 8
years or so, it seems like that's been the best position to be in.  Whether
it's the '05 Steelers, '96 Colts, '09 Saints, '10 Packers, or '07 and '11
Giants...lower-seeded team get on these emotional rolls and seem almost
invincible.  In fact, only 2 of the last 7 Super Bowl champs have been a #1 or
#2 seed.

And I'm sure people remember from 2005 how powerful a "retirement/redemption"
tour can be.

The question is, can they beat the Patriots in Foxboro, when New England is
almost invincible in games like this at home and when the Patriots beat them in
this exact same spot last year?  Reid and the Eagles eventually got over the
hump and got to a Super Bowl...but that was at home (2004).  This is a tougher
beast.

I don't really think either defense is in a position to stop the other team,
but the Ravens are coming off of a double-OT game in a high-altitude climate. 
They absolutely cannot afford for the Patriots to get ahead and set a
fast-paced tempo.  That would be a formula for a blow-out.  IMO, the Ravens
need to ball control and slow the game down to help their defense.

Meanwhile, Brady has developed an interception trend over the last few years in
the playoffs.  Like in the other game, I think the home QB is actually more
likely to make the killer mistake here.  Not very likely...but Brady takes
chances that I don't think Flacco would.

This one should be as close and exciting as last year, but I'll go with the
"destiny" angle snad say that the result will be different.

Living in St. Louis I hear a lot about Stan Musial and of course all the TV
stations and sports radio have been doing tributes.

I heard an interesting thing last night about Stan and why he likely is not
regarded as one of the best of all time outside of St. Louis and baseball
historians.

Stan never really broke any records or was flashy.  He doesn't have that one
moment etched into baseball fans minds like Aron, Williams, Mays, etc.  What he
did have was a long period of simply amazing play.  Most guys have a 5-6 year
span where they put up really great numbers but they have a lead up to that and
then a drop off.  Stan had almost 20 years of great statistical baseball.

Hell, Bud Selig had to add him to the MLB All-Century team in 99 because the
fans didn't vote him in.

Yep.  And if you look at Musial's numbers, you have to remember -- he suffered
a significant drop in his numbers after 1957.  Over his final 6 seasons, he
averaged just 16 homers, 63 RBI and 140 hits per year, despite playing between
115-135 games per season.

I say that not to disrespect, just to show how amazing it is that he could take
six years out of his career and STILL get the career numbers he finished with.
v
Over his prime, from 1948-1957, he was arguably the best player anywhere.  To
illustrate this, Musial was in the top 3 for WAR for five consecutive years
frmo 1948-1952.  He was also top-5 in MVP balloting for each of those years.

And the Har-Bowl is set.  Super Bowl XLVII will pit the Baltimore Ravens
against the San Francisco 49ers.

The two teams are coached by brothers Jim (49ers) and John (Ravens) Harbaugh.

San Francisco overcame an early 17-0 deficit to win in Atlanta, 28-24. 
Baltimore won their rematch with New England, 28-13, after trailing 13-7 at the
half.  The Patriots' loss was their first ever at home in an AFC Championship
game.  It was also the first-ever home loss for Tom Brady after leading at
halftime.  He was previously 67-0 in those situations.

This is just the 4th time in Super Bowl history that both participants earned
their spots by winning on the road.  It happened for Super Bowl I, then not
again until the Bills and Cowboys met in Super Bowl XXVII.  The last time it
happened was when John Elway won his first ring in Super Bowl XXXII.

San Francisco becomes the 9th different NFC team in the last 10 years and 12th
different in the last 15 years to earn a Super Bowl berth.  Only the Cowboys,
Redskins and Lions have failed to make the Super Bowl in that span.

The Ravens win marks the first time in 10 years that the AFC winner is NOT the
Patriots, Colts or Steelers.

San Francisco opened as a 4.5 point favorite.

Belichick and the 49ers were responsible for the Ravens drafting Ray Lewis. In
1995 before he was fired by the Browns and before the Browns moved to
Baltimore, Belichick and the 49ers made a trade which gave the Browns a 1st
round draft pick. Later when they the Browns became the Ravens, that 1st round
draft pick turned into Ray Lewis. Kind of ironic that in the final 2 games of
his career, Lewis will have played the coach and the team that lead to him

Mail and X messages are not even "remotely" the same thing?  "Not even a little

If you are paranoid about leaving X messages on the server, the client should
have the option to delete them.  Just like POP or IMAP email works.  If you are
worried about someone sending you something that gets stored on the server,
that same argument would have to apply to storing email on the server, since
you can't dictate (at least currently) how users chose to communicate with you.

Get rid of the concept of X messages completely, make everything Mail, and then

Notifying of new mail is a good idea, but it's not as simple as it is to notify
that you're close to idle time-out - there is not "push notification" really,
it's just a message that pops up when you're idle for too long, or when you
reach a certain point in your log in.  Aside from time, there's no real
trigger.  With Mail>, there would need to be a mechanism in constantly check
for new Mail> (or maybe an eXpress message attempt when someone attempts to
send mail).  Doable, I think, though.

As far as what other BBS's do - the fact that other BBS's do it doesn't mean
that it's a good idea, or any easier to do.  It depends on how X messages are
treated by the system and by the users.  On ISCA, X messages seem to be treated
as they were intended - instant messages while a user is logged in, like AIM or
some other real time systems, whereas Mail> is intended for overall
correspondance, like email.  It's really a silly argument - if you want Mail>
and X messages combined, just use Mail> and ignore X messages all together.

There's different code handling different delivery mechanisms, different
limitations and different storage files.  If you want to say the BBS handles
them in different ways, that's fine.  But you have yet to explain why they are
fundamentally different in functionality.  I don't care that the BBS treats
them differently.  I get that.  But even you just agreed that "Notifying of new

5 lines of a new Mail message when that notification comes through.

And now do you see what you have at that point?  Now you can remove all the X
message code entirely.  It's like magic or some shit.

No.  Actually, the opposite.  I think we're at a good point to merge Mail and X
messages to simplify code -- not rewrite everything.  All that needs to be done
is to hook Mail messages into the notification system and show the first 5
lines of the message.  Then you alias the X message command to Mail and your
done.  Is that a "complete rewrite of everythging"?  Because saying that seems
rather alarmist.

We're not talking about rewriting the email specification here.  We aren't
talking about interfacing with other systems.  This is ISCA mail.  The only,
and I stress ONLY reasons people use Mail on ISCA falls into one of three
categories;

1)  The user is offline  (70 pts, family fued style)
2)  The message is longer than 5 lines (25 FFPs)
3)  You want to store the message on the server for some reason (5 FFPs)

Right now, messegaes and X messages are two completely different systems.  And
with gestalt, they're actually each handled by different software.  So you are
actually talking about interfacing with other systems.

It's a bit more complicated than you seem to believe that it is.  And frankly,
I honestly don't think that it's a change that most people would be interested
in.  I think people X message more than anything else on here, so a merging of
the two doesn't really make that much sense to me.

And, quite frankly, I think you're talking about the only three reasons YOU
use ISCA Mail>.  Unless I feel like actually engaging with someont real time, I
generally prefer to use Mail> to correspond with other privately.  And I'm
pretty sure I'm not alone here.

The most important thing here, I think, is that the current process works.  We
could make some improvements, for sure.  Notification of emails, for instance,
dumping X messages to Mail> if the user has logged out (though, a client could
likely do this more easily), but I don't see the benefit in changing the system
altogether, I don't think we'd see any real benefit from such an effort.

   Mail> is slightly more difficult to use than x-messages (requiring extra

at the moment) and if Mail and x-messages were to be merged in some form --
which, I gather from the tenour of the discussion isn't at all likely -- it
should be done in a way that doesn't diminish the utility of either form of
communication.
   What might be useful would be combining *access* to both Xs and Mail>
through a common command structure, e.g., typing "x" at the prompt and entering
the name of the addressee would then allow you either to start typing the
x-message directly, or to add another command to get into Mail, all without
leaving your current activity.  That could also abolish one of the BBS' oddest

*  X messages and Mail are completely different things.  X messages are
   notified instantly to the user and not stored on the server, while Mail
   messages have no direct notification to the user, but are stored on the
   server.

*  It might be a good idea to make Mail behave like X messages, by
   notifying the user when they get a new Mail message

*  It might be a good idea to store X messages on the server, to make them
   more accessible, like Mail messages.

*  X messages and Mail are completely different things.


Ah.  Gotcha.


And Copper, I understand that X messages and Mail messages are handled by
different code.  Read that again.  I get it.  What I'm saying is that the
choice to handle them differently doesn't actually make them different.
Both facilities consist of sending a blob of text to a user.  If you read
the bullet points above again, you'll see the discussion is already about
convergence.

But then there is ...

  "only three reasons YOU use ISCA Mail>.  Unless I feel like actually
   engaging with someont real time, I generally prefer to use Mail> to
   correspond with other privately.  And I'm pretty sure I'm not alone
   here."

Can you explain this?  What's to stop someone from engaging with you real
time when you send them a Mail message vs. an X message?  It's as though
you believe the protocol you use to communicate with someone can force them
not to communicate back to you in a different way.  That's not even how the
BBS works currently -- you're just assuming the user would Reply to your
mail instead of Xing you.

Again, what I'm talking about is simply removing half the communication
code and tweaking the other half.  For example, get rid of X messages
and add a priority flag to Mail messages.  Alias the X command to be a
new Mail message with a priority of 1.  Anything with a priority of 1
is delivered instantly to the user (with text) while anything else (like
a message started with the Mail command) just notifies the user it exists.

That isn't a complete rewrite of everything.  You get the advantages
of storing all messages on the server in a single place and the instant
notification for Mail messages.  And I'm all about simplification.  Pull
that off and most users wouldn't even notice the change while at the same
time removing half the communication code.  I consider that progress.

For me, x-messages are instant, transient, interrupting, and highly
temporal -- they are the electronic equivalant of a phone call.  Mail
messages are the electronic equivalant of... Mail.  They are permanent,
can be read at ones convienence, and I write them more formally than
instant messages.

The logging of instant messages bugs me a lot.  It would be amazingly
trivial to take all of my voice calls and in-personal conversations, run
them through a speech-to-text program, and archive the results so that
I can remember what I said and what was said to me.  Doing that is not
only fucking rude, it's also against the law in some areas.  I don't
understand why the electronic equivalent of something that is
breathtakingly rude in real life is so widely adopted, but that doesn't
mean that I, personally, want to be part of it.

Gestalt's approach allows users to select which level of privacy
they want; your approach forces your level of logging (that is, everything)
on everyone.  I hate that.

Gestalt offers two protocols: in one, a message of mostly-arbitrary length
is sent to the server and a notification is sent to the user (if they are
logged in); in the other, a brief message is sent directly to the user
if they are logged in (in the olden days, the x-message went client-to-
client, without even going *through* the server, but that was difficult to
maintain going forward).  The x-message system has a bunch of status
stuff (are they busy, are they writing you a message, what conversational
mode are they in, who is allowed to interrupt them verssus who must wait);
Mail doesn't have any of those.

Them that writes the code makes the rules.  You, as a software developer,
can do one of four things:
  - Write your own client that blends X-messages and Mail in whatever manner
    you see fit, and then use it.  If having other people not using it burns
    your beans (why?), then try and make it the best client out there so that
    everyone uses it.
  - Write a gateway that speaks Gestalt's protocols, and silently maps all
    x-messages to Mail.  Tell everyone how cool it would be for them to
    use that instead of the standard Gestalt servers.  People who use your
    gateway and end up sending hundreds of mail messages instead of
    x-messages will end up driving the recipients to your gateway (or to
    de-friend them).
  - Write an entire non-Gestalt system that looks just like ISCABBS but has
    your ideas in them, and say "here is something that is better, plus it
    was written in this century!"  After thirteen years of debate, ISCA might
    agree with you and start using it.
  - Port DOC to Linux, but add this new feature.

separate and from a programming standpoint having one system to handle both

and more elegant.

Similar code was used to prevent an FM from booting themselves from a forum.
(very simple test:  If user is FM, don't ask questions, let them in).  Altering
the order in which the tests are applied (ie: FM status, check whether

Just to clarify --

   The message database for DOC is a massive circular binary file containing
messages.  When you "log into" ISCA your account is basically a collection of
pointers into that message file saying which messages you have/have not read
yet.  When you connect, DOC launches a new process for you to "look" at the
database and do this.  That interface is what we think of as "the BBS" but it's
not, it's just an interface.  You can also look at the message data by
connecting through another interface, such as RSS.  I have also written a web
front-end that will connect for you, though I've had to shelve it for the time
being to work on other stuff.

   The next phase of ISCABBS is essentially to port to Linux.  We were led to
believe, for literally years, that the Linux port was all set and ready to go
and just needed to be tested.  ISCA came to the conclusion last fall that,
whether or not, this is true, ISCA was very unlikely to ever get a copy of this
"ready to go" port.  ISCA decided instead to license an existing port of ISCA
to Linux, I believe they announced this in ISCA Comm>.

  That port includes a clone of this interface.  When ISCA completes that
transition, you will still connect via an interface that looks like this, but
on the backend we'll have a MySQL database instead of a binary circular file.

  That is work going on now, and it's what we've been working on since about
March-ish.  In parallel, I worked for a while on converting the DOC binary data
files to the version supported by the publicly-available DOC Linux port as a
fallback measure.  That work has since been shelved, and some of that code has
been recycled for writing a migration utility to port the ISCA user data file
to MySQL.

  The features of "this" interface to the BBS - the command-line interface, are
not likely to change substantially.  For one, people don't really want them to.
 Second, it's throwing good effort after bad.  Certain bugs and what not may be
fixed, and you may see something changes, such as room histories going back
further than 150 posts, but that's because the underlying data structures have
changed, not because anything with the interface has changed.

  Conservatively, I would say ISCA has made more progress towards moving to
Linux in the last 6 months than in all the previous years of ISCA, Inc.,
combined.

  I wish it was more visible, but most of what's going on is really boring
stuff like updating namespace references in old C++ code and poring over data
structure header files to figure out how to extract message pointer offsets,
and setting up MySQL schemas, and figuring out how to get a C program to link
in the mysql API libraries, and so forth.

  It's not sexy work.

Quick clarification- last I'd heard the code was going to Gestalt- is that what
the "license linux port" you mention is, or is that something else?

"ISCA" means "Iowa Student Computing Alumni," the non-profit corporation which
manages the ISCABBS assets.

"ISCA BBS" is this project.  "DOC" is the name of the system we run now and
usually also refers to the command-line interface.  "whip" is a shorthand
reference to the BBS hardware server.

KS - Yes, Gestalt is the port ISCA licensed.  It's basically ready-to-bake out
of the box but for a few things.  Chiefly, they are:

 (a) user data migration routine (assigned to me, not done)
 (b) updating the gim command-line interface (Tanj, done)
 (c) DOS/spam-abuse blocking feature (design discussion on-going)

We're then basically ready-to-launch, although we'll be missing a handful of
features that we can add in later.  Guide flags, I think, are one of them.

The over-arching goal of all of this is to rid of ourselves of a major failure
point, namely the HPUX hardware, which is well beyond its shelf life and will
eventually die on us.

In my opinion as a mere user, this is ISCA's highest operational priority at
the moment.

I also believe there are number of equally compelling management and governance
projects ISCA ought to be simultaneously pursuing, but I do not feel that ISCA
has the drive or interest to complete any of them.

I have.  I asked to have it updated to reflect our current plans months ago.

ISCA is a non-profit corporation that is responsible for managing the BBS and
other related projects.  I can't tell you who is "in" ISCA because that
information is not public knowledge.  There are about 30 people who are
stakeholders in ISCA and have voting rights for certain decisions by the
organization.

However, the majority of what ISCA does is directed by the "Policy Board,"
which what we call (for reasons I don't understanD) our Board of Directors.

I can tell you that I was on this Board for the last year and resigned
about a month ago.  I do not know who, if anybody, has been elected to replace
me, as I also discontinued my participation in the ISCA non-profit organization
to put more time into my family's charitable foundation.

As far as other members, the president and secretary are required by law to be
disclosed on our forms filed with the Iowa Secretary of State office.

Does that help any?  I may not be understanding what specifically you want to
know...

  I'd put it differently.  I'd say the areas of responsibility aren't
  understand or known by anybody, including ISCA and/or the board.

  ISCA is run by a group of gentle and kind people, none of whom wish to
  tell anybody else what to do, or hold anybody else accountable for not
  doing it, because nobody wants to violate the orgnaization's general sense
  of community, unity, and comity, which is pretty strong for a group of
  people who don't really know each other.

Vanity> ISCA used to be "Iowa Student Computer Association" (sp?) which was an
U of Iowa association for the CompSci Students IIRC. This bbs, ISCABBS, mostly
had UI students and alumni as its userbase, but also people from other places
(like me). Eventually the heyday of BBSen went by, and ISCABBS fell into
neglect. ISCA (the student org) either went poof, or decided to reorganize as a
separate entity outside UI, and decided to take the BBS with them. Hence the
creation of ISCA Inc, preserving the structure of ISCA (which is probably why
they still use terms like "Policy Board".) This is also what led to the name
change for ISCABBS' FQDN: used to be whip.isca.uiowa.edu, now its
bbs.iscabbs.com reflecting ISCA being now outside the U of Iowa.

So now when you hear ISCA, it's the owner of ISCABBS, or the governing body of
ISCABBS, if you'd like to put it that way.

  (not so) slowly, isca is dying.

  The plan is to keep the good old telnet interface for you fuddy duddies
  who won't change ("get off my lawn"), but other interfaces will be hooked
  up for those of us who want change.

  Being able to see more than 150 posts would be useful (to find that
  piece of info that scrolled/you need) and then of course, searching would
  be necessary to locate it when you get into high numbers (hell, searching
  thru 150 posts now is a pain).

I appreciate that, but I don't forsee a magnificent future for the BBS
regardless of the interface it provides.  The features don't matter (what's

what we have to work with.  Anyone that's coming here (even if there's a fancy
web interface, Java client, RSS feed,e tc) is going to be a fuddy duddy.  Why?
Because all the non-fuddy duddies are going to be on Facebook.

Adding features and changing interfaces in the name of bringing new blood here,
attracting users, and growing the community is going to be an exercise in
frustration.  Porting to Linux, adding features, making things "better" for the
sheer enjoyment of the effort and the completion of those projects -- that's
worthwhile.  But pinning to it dreams of a glorious return for the BBS --
that's setting one's self up for disappointment.

the idea of new users: there is still very little in the way of software that
allows for quick, text-rich, subject-based discussion.  The news/picture
aggregators like Reddit have a threaded format based on links with some nominal
categorization, but otherwise what's out there is really slow and requires
hundreds of page navigations to work through a big discussion.  Or you have
email lists, which don't require "presence" and of course there's still
Usenet nominally.  But if I want to talk with a group of intelligent people
about Beer or Camping Equipment or the latest Supreme Court decision, there are
not only few communities that cover all this there really isn't any software

Another BBS that recently fell into my administration once tried to do the "new

switching to plain vanilla Citadel, which had a telnet interface that well...
sucks in comparison to DOC (ISCA) and bbs1000 (the one they were originally
using). They eventually did revert to the original one, but a lot of the users
had gone away by then. Fortunately, Gestalt wasn't such a change from DOC, so
it might actualy work here. :)

The single biggest reason to get the system moved is the hardware.  It's very

knowing the current state of things.

.....

As of right now, there is no Gestalt port to finish.  I don't even know if
Gestalt is installed on the development server, much less at a point where one
could say that there isn't much less to finish.  I don't know the code at all,
and no one who does has worked on it.

At one point we had a working copy of vDOC running, with user migration
working (users could be ported, message base could not), and an essentially
working BBS, but vDOC was apparently vetoed at some point.

It's not an issue right now, and we don't know where it's hosted.
I mean, it's currently an issue, but it's not an issue for the future.

The current code will not run on CentOS.  At some point there was a working
port, but no one really knows what happened to it, and we've been unable to
duplicate that work.

Whatever we end up using in the future will likely run on CentOS, yes, though
any code we use will likely be distribution independent.

Getting the code running on Linux isn't the hard part.  Many
different people have done it independently and it could be done
again with very little problem.

Translating the old data structures to the new data structures
isn't the hard part, either -- although it is slightly harder and
there are some things to worry about, it's already been done at
least once.

The hard parts are:

1. you need to trust someone to do that translation

2. you need to have the parties in charge willing to sign off on #1

3. you need to have the parties in charge willing to switch over
to the new BBS at some point, which will likely have some kind of
problem along the line simply because we are out in the unknown

4. you need to convince someone to spend time on this project without
knowing if the parties in charge will do #2 and #3

This isn't a code problem.

We've had all of those parts, and yet, here we are.

I know of no one who has gotten DOC working properly under Linux, with the
exception of Serendipity/Tiberius, on a test BBS that was running for 10
minutes (code that has, apparently, disappeared), and even that version,
apparently, had issues that kept it from running correctly.

If someone has really gotten the code running independently, I'd love to know
who those individuals are, so that I can have a conversation with them and try
to figure out what's going on with our own port.

As a user, the only differences I see between isca and inara from a technical
standpoint are that inara has no timeout, and does have some extra features
that isca lacks ("doing" field, extra stuff if you type different stuff at the
short prompt, random messages at logout, occasional random messages in place of
"Goto" when you've lobbied out, etc.)

The biggest difference is in administration.  Isca has rules and procedures and
guidelines and bylaws.  Inara has "don't be a douchebag."

I'd put in my 2 cents: an attempt to implement vanilla Citadel on another BBS
just to get the "extra interface" instead killed that other Citadel-ish BBS.
The codebase was bbs100, which works similar to this one; the one that caused
the users to go away was Citadel (not DOC, that is).

I don't think "modern clients" should be a priority at this point.  In the
future?  Sure, I don't really care.  The immediate problem is that the BBS is
not "fault tolerant" in that no one can fix it if something goes bad.  The
immediate concern should be addressing this shortfall.

Get the BBS running "as close to to what it is today" on something new, then
worry about adding features/replacing it with something else.

I can maybe get an Itanium running HP-UX online, but it'd be running off my
cable modem.  I'm not sure you want to go that route (rx2600 I have laying
around that currently has OpenVMS on it).

Having "adding features" be a blocker for "ensuring the application's survival"
seems pretty short-sighted to me.

friend installed.  It is written in completely obfuscated PHP and, from the
bits I can read, I really don't trust it...

I got access to their cpanel, php is installed and it looks like that's how it
got in.  Also a .htaccess file with a redirect module command... #cc3284d#
malvertising infection, appears to have been pretty common over the last week.

Will take more work to track down the way it got in, since nobody's logged in
via FTP in a year or more.

Of course, that only gets tracked down if they want to pay me, right now I was
only charged with getting them back working.

Forgive the newbie questions as I haven't been on IRC since the 90s but how is
it typically accessed these days?  Is there a client like mIRC that is
preferable?  And are there still networks of servers like dalnet?

mIRC is still the dominant Windows client, especially if you want something
with a lot of features. If you're just looking for simple access, check out
ChatZilla or Mibbit, both of which are web browser-based clients, don't eat a
lot of memory and offer quite a few unique features (jut not as powerful as
mIRC).

Nearly all of the great IRC networks are still around, and there's plenty to
choose from.

Anyone know what fasecodestresser.co.cc is? Now that I've locked down my DNS
server, I still detect a lot of DNS requests (though the DNS server is now
refusing them for being out of zone) and most of them are requests for TXT
records on said domain. Huh?

I'm thinking of just blocking port 53 to everything except my slave DNS server
and have any DNS queries being answered by that one for a couple of weeks.

I did a search for that query and found this info:

I've been out of the downloading scene for awhile.  I used to use bittorrent
but that is getting increasingly risky I hear.

Are there any other technologies for downloading that are safer?  I keep
hearing about paying to download from Usenet.  Surprises me because Usenet is
ancient and I don't remember having to pay for it back in the day.

Anyhoo, what is the safest way to download these days?  And if it's Usenet,
does anyone have recommendations for a good Usenet provider?

Thanks!

Usenet is VASTLY superior to torrents, and entirely "safe" in the
RIAA-GONNA-SUE sense.

But yeah, it'll cost you 10-30 bucks a month depending on how nice a service
you want.

On the other hand it can (barring live sports events) entirely replace cable TV
which costs a lot more (plus many other pay services)

I've got a whole tutorial for usenet I'll repost shortly.

BODY: 

For usenet, there's basically 3 or 4 parts (3 to manually get anything you
want, a 4th part if you want it totally automatic):


1) A usenet provider.  Giganews is the gold standard, but also the most
expensive... $25/mo gets you unlimited downloads as fast as your internet
connection can go... you can go with cheaper plans (which are usually like
10gig or 50 gig or whatever per month limits) if you aren't going to pull down
a ton every month...there's also other, cheaper alternatives that offer
unlimited plans in the 10-15 buck a month range.

The main differences between providers are speed (some of the cheaper ones will
only let you pull at say 5 or 10 mb/sec rather than maxxing your bandwidth),
support (giganews is high
bandwidth, high availability, 24/7 support, etc)... and retention... that is
how far back they keep shit... Giganews is at about 4-5 years or so now... the
longer the retention the more shit they have available.... If the Llama porn
you're looking for is obscure enough to only get reposted every 2-3 years and
your provider only has 6 months retention you're probably not getting it.



2) An indexing/searching site.  Newzbin (currently living at
http://www.newzbin2.es/ ) is the gold standard here.
This is a bit like google for usenet.  They charge like $1.25 a month or so,
and the
results will generate something called an NZB file.  Most stuff is posted
to usenet in chunks, sometimes hundreds of chunks for one thing.  The NZB is a
single file that basicaly says 'Grab the following shit for a complete download
of this item'

The NZB then gets automatically passed to....

3) Your download client.  I think giganews offers a free one now with
membership... I use Newsbin (no relation to newzbin) which at the time was $20
(one time fee for lifetime license) via a discount from giganews.  This takes
the NZB file, grabs all the relevant chunks, and reassembles them for you,
dropping it where you specify, with a ton of settings you can adjust.


With the above you can go to newzbin, search on say Avatar, and you'll see
a list of all the copies of avatar available on usenet... there might be say a
3D full ISO of the extended edition bluray up, a couple copies on DVD, a non-3D
bluray, etc....   You just check the box next to the one you want and hit
create NZB, it generates an NZB and sends it to the download client, the
download client grabs the files from your
provider and assembles them, and in a little while your copy of avatar is on
your hard drive.

Now, the 4th bit- automation.

I use a program called NZB-TV... you basically click "add a title" then fill in
as much or as little of the fields the "add title" box has- you can be as
general as "Grab all episodes of seasons 1-10 of show X" or as specific as
"Grab only french-language versions of season 3 of seinfied, but only odd
numbered episodes, and only if they are in AVI format, and only if they are
larger than 100 mb"


It will then automatically (as often as you specify- I have it run twice a day
myself) go out to newzbin, run searches for all your titles for any
episodes it doesn't have yet that you asked for, and if they're there, pull
the NZB and send it to the download client.

So this takes probably 30-60 minutes to set everything up, depending how many
shows you watch... but then after that everything just shows up on your
computer within a couple hours of being posted (which is usually within a
couple hours of airing for new stuff) all automatic like.

NZB-TV was free until version 2.0 came out a couple weeks ago, now it's 15
pounds.  The most popular still-free alternative is called Sickbeard, I haven't
used it, but a lot of people do, and if I was starting from scratch I'd look at
it seriously since it's still free... both should have similar capabilities
though.


We dropped cable entirely about 20 months ago and have been using this system
exclusively, and it works great.

Now, depending how you watch TV, there might be one other element... if you
just watch stuff on a PC, you're good.... if you watch it on a TV that has a PC
directly plugged in (ie using windows media center to directly play to the TV)
you're fine... but if you want to stream over the network from a PC or NAS to a
TV someplace not directly attached, you'll need some kind of media streamer on
the TV end.
Some newer TVs have (usually very limited) media streaming capability... you
can plug in a network cable and they'll play some limited formats, sometimes...
the best of these will let you use something like Plex on the PC end that will
transcode your video into a format the TV can handle and play.
If you want the best quality video and audio (esp. if you want any more audio
channels than just stereo) you'll want a real hardware media streamer on the TV
end though.
How nice depends on your needs... we wanted something that plays everything, up
to and including a full bluray ISO with menus and 7.1 HD audio, so we have a
Dune (which is in the $250 range).... if you're fine with non-HD 5.1 audio, and
don't care about menu/ISO support, you can get streamers that do most
everything else for $50-125.
(in theory the xbox 360 or PS3 can be a media streamer, but again you're fairly
limited in formats supported... we used these for a while and got tired of
having to find things in specific formats, or transcoding and losing quality)

Thanks.  I had done some googling last night about this and heard good things
about Giganews.

How important is an indexing site?  I don't plan on downloading very much. 
Mostly ebooks, comics, and the occasional video.  So I was thinking that
Giganews' $5/mo plan would be enough for this.

For this use case, how important is the indexing site, as these files will be
relatively small?  Back in the day I seem to remember that you could just do
searches from within the client?

Do you think it's important to have VPN connection with the server?

Yeah, if you're downloading small volume one of the "block" plans (vs
unlimited) is likely fine- unlimited is if you're gonna be pulling movies and
TV shows (esp bluray and high def stuff)...

The indexing site- well, some clients have search, but I can't speak to how
well they work as the $1-something a month for newzbin is invaluable
for folks doing heavy downloading so that's what my experience is with- you can
always try the free methods and see how they work and then use a pay service
later if it's not working for you.

As to VPN- depends how paranoid you are... right now probably not super
neccesary... if ISP coordination with IP owners increases further might be
another story.

Here's my thoughts on usenet and attendant providers/software:

You might be surprised to find that your provider still offers Usenet service,
typically farmed out to giganews or one of the 2nd tier providers. If not, or
you need a backup with 1000+ day retenti on, I like Astraweb.  Unless you
download A LOT, the astraweb $50/TB bulk bandwidth offering is the best deal
I've found.

NZBs - I like nzbmatrix.  ~$10 for a 10 year premium membership.  I'm not
saying it's as good as newzbin, but I haven't failed to find the stuff that I
have gone looking for, either.

Client software - I like sabnzbdplus for downloading nzbs.  It runs as a web
service, is cross platform, and there are chrome and firefox plugins available
if you want to add NZBs manually.  I rarely add nzbs manually, though, since I
used sickbeard to search the nzb aggregator (nzbmatrix in my case), and hand
off the nzbs to sabnzbdplus. Sickbeard also sorts the resulting downloads into
directories.

If you use sabnzbdplus, there are other specialty nzb grabbers such as
couchpotato.  I don't do much with these, but they look like they might be
convenient depending on your tastes.

Thanks for the tips!  I found this combination this morning, and I think it
will serve my limited purposes.

http://www.nzbindex.nl/  This is where you can search Usenet for stuff you
might want to download.  You save the search results in a .NZB file.

http://usenetstorm.com/  You upload the NZB file here, and you can download the
result.

All without having to register for anything, or pay for anything.

Download speed is slow, but this should work well for ebooks and comics.  500MB
file size limit, and 1GB per day total download limit.

Okay, I'm in a really stupid situation at my workplace.
I have a server that has windows vista on it. I need to install an SSL
certificate on it.
We've opted to use a self-signed certificate, which I've created using OpenSSL
and already installed in my Local Machine.

Unfortunately, the next step (as far as I'm aware) is to run netsh. I keep
getting this error:

SSL Certificate add failed, Error: 1312
A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated.


Google searches have told me that:

(a) this is a known issue in Windows 7, and a hotfix exists (sadly, I am on
windows xp)
(b) this error occasionally happens with makecert (which I do not have, I am
using openssl)

Has anyone run into this, or have any wisdom to impart?

WRITE DOWN ALL YOUR CONFIGS (or maybe download the zone files or whatever)

I didn't and had to re-cobble everything together.  Happily they (EasyDNS)
helped and it was pretty straight forward.

Also, if you're gonna do this, contact EasyDNS first - once the domain transfer
goes through, GoDaddy will *immediately* stop resolving your domain.  So they
recommend that you change the nameservers over to easyDNS first, and then enact
the actual transfer.  I did not do this so my domain went dark for the better

On MSN, the latest Messenger update also fucked up the screenname ability. It
now lets you change only the "subnick" field, while your actual nickname is
forced into being your full name. That led to me having my REAL name on an IM
service (a universal no-no since the ICQ days). Once I found out about this, I
went to Hotmail and changed my name to "Danix" "Defcon 5". Fuck MS, if you're
going to pull that shit on me, you're no longer getting my real name.

Mozilla Suspends Firefox 16 Downloads: Serious Bug
Mozilla warns that Firefox 16 contains significant vulnerability, plans to
offer patched version for download as soon as possible.

By Mathew J. Schwartz    InformationWeek
October 11, 2012 11:22 AM
Just one day after releasing Firefox 16, Mozilla Wednesday suspended downloads
of the new software after it discovered a security vulnerability in the
browser.
In a security warning, Firefox director of security assurance Michael Coates,
said that "the vulnerability could allow a malicious site to potentially
determine which websites users have visited and have access to the URL or URL
parameters." But he said that Mozilla had seen no evidence that the bug was
being exploited by in-the-wild attacks.
Even so, "Firefox 16 has been temporarily removed from the current installer
page and users will automatically be upgraded to the new version as soon as it
becomes available," said Coates. Furthermore, he noted that "as a precaution,
users can downgrade to version 15.0.1," though he said that any current version
16 installations would be automatically updated after the patch gets issued.
Mozilla plans to issue a patched version of Firefox 16 Thursday.
[ Security threats are growing. Read Web API Allows Phishing Attack. ]
In the interim, however, is downgrading to Firefox 15.1 wise? According to
vulnerability information provider Secunia, Firefox 15.x contains numerous
"highly critical" vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to remotely
bypass the browser's security controls, execute a cross-site scripting attack,
spoof websites, crash the browser, or access a user's system. All told, it said
there are 23 issues, which remain--as yet--unpatched in version 15, though
Mozilla reported fixing 14 known vulnerabilities in version 16.
According to market watcher Net Applications, as of September 2012, Firefox
controlled 20% of the desktop browser market, putting it behind Internet
Explorer (54%), but ahead of other rivals, including Chrome (19%), Safari (5%),
and Opera (2%).
In other security-related browser news, the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF) Monday, together with the Tor Project, announced the release of HTTPS
Everywhere version 3.
The privacy tool, which is a browser add-on, forces an encrypted HTTPS
connection on any website that offers users a choice between HTTP and HTTPS.
"Many sites on the Web offer some limited support for encryption over HTTPS,
but make it difficult to use," according to the HTTPS Everywhere download page.
"For instance, they may default to unencrypted HTTP, or fill encrypted pages
with links that go back to the unencrypted site. The HTTPS Everywhere extension
fixes these problems by using a clever technology to rewrite requests to these
sites to HTTPS."
Despite the branding, however, the tool won't work everywhere, although it does
now work with 1,500 sites--or about twice as many as with the previous
version--and gets used by about 2.5 million people. "Our current estimate is
that HTTPS Everywhere 3 should encrypt at least a hundred billion page views in
the next year, and trillions of individual HTTP requests," said EFF technology
projects director Peter Eckersley in a blog post.
So far, stable versions of HTTPS Everywhere have only been available for
Firefox. But the EFF and Tor, together with a group of volunteers, are
developing a version for Chrome and Chromium, though it's not yet ready for
public release.

  I don't use it very often, but it seems nice.
  Better than running iTunes on my Windows machine *gah*!
  My Android phone has a huge crack/broken glass so I don't use it much
  (work phone) but before that, i did try out Google Music and it seems
  better than "music" on the iPhone, such that I have 1 list of songs,
  but I can specify which should be copied locally (so they are available
  when I'm not on a network connection). Obviously works with any public
  internet connection where as iTunes+iPhone only works on my home network.

  I don't like the thumbs up/down only options for "ratings". I prefer 3 or
  5 stars.

  If I remember correctly, iCloud doesn't stream...?

I have had iTunes on PC set up to sync with Google Music for over a year now. 
It syncs the music and the playlists automatically.

I mainly use a paid iOS app called Gmusic to stream the music.  This app has
had its problems but in the latest version it works well.  It gives you the
option to save the songs locally once they've been played to give you access to
some songs when not connected to the internet.

I've also streamed the songs from Google Play website, and that works pretty
well too.

I've enjoyed having easy access to all the songs on various iPads and iTouches
I've owned, without filling up the devices limited space.

 Change is in the Air: Updates to Yahoo! Messenger Features

November 30, 2012 on 5:27 pm | In Features, Other services, Pingbox,
Uncategorized, Voice | Comments Off

Here at Yahoo!, we aspire to make the worlds daily habits inspiring and
entertaining. More than ever, were focused on building products that are
beautiful and meaningful for our users. Sometimes, this means we have to make
tough decisions  like closing down features that we feel arent adding enough
value for you. This helps us spend more energy on creating experiences that
make Yahoo! the most fun way to spend your time.

With this in mind, we have decided to discontinue several Yahoo! product
features. This will enable us to refocus our efforts on modernizing our core
Yahoo! products experiences and of course, create new ones. You can find more
details below, including how the closures will work.

Yahoo! Messenger Public Chat Rooms
The Yahoo! Messenger Public Chat Rooms will close down on December 14, 2012.

Yahoo! Messenger Pingbox
As of December 14, 2012, Pingbox will no longer be available on Yahoo!
Messenger. If youve installed Pingbox on your blog or social networks, please
click here to learn how to uninstall it.

Yahoo! Messenger interoperability with Microsoft Windows Live Messenger
Yahoo! Messenger will no longer be interoperable with Microsoft Windows Live
Messenger as of December 14, 2012. Microsoft buddies will still appear on your
Messenger contact list, but they will be greyed out, and if you try to send
instant messages to them, the messages will not be delivered.

Yahoo! Voice Phone In and Phone Out feature
Effective January 30, 2013, we will no longer offer Yahoo! Voice Phone In and
Phone Out capabilities, our co-branded landline and mobile phone service from
Jajah. As of today, users can no longer add new funds to their accounts, and
active users who currently have a balance in their accounts will receive
emailed instructions in December from Jajah on how to request a refund. You can
find more information on how to ask for a refund here, and you can contact
Jajah with any questions at yahoovoice@jajah.com. Free Messenger-to-Messenger
calls will still be offered through Yahoo! Messenger.

Thank you to everyone who have used these features. We plan to keep innovating
and building great Yahoo! products that will delight our users in the years to
come.

their market, there are still people who depend on MSN Messenger for IMing.

  Yes, well, depends on the proxy server.
  Many years ago, to get to ISCA, I would telnet to the proxy and then
  to isca.

  That was a long time ago so my memory is a bit faded, but I want to say
  it was as simple as
  telnet proxy port
  (then I got some prompt)
  telnet isca 23

  Maybe.

I have a question about downloading stuff off of Usenet.

Some Usenet providers have SSL newsservers.  Others provide VPN access for a
premium.

From a privacy standpoint, can anyone discuss the difference between the two? 
What can your ISP see when you use SSL versus VPN?

If it makes any difference, I'm using the web port for SSL.

As long as everything is properly implemented by your Usenet provider, your ISP
should only be able to see that you are making a connection to your provider,
and nothing more. If it does, then either your Usenet provider is leaking data
like a sieve, or your ISP is performing a "man in the middle" attack on your
connection.

  Your ISP can see:

  The URL you're going to if you go to HTTPS
  All data transmitted is encrypted.

  Or they see the "URL" (hostname/domainname) of the VPN server you connect
  to. All data transmitted is encrypted.

  Which looks less incriminating?
  https://usenet.provider.com
  or
  VPN: anonymouse.provider.com

As Wang Master said ... they won't actually see https://usenet.provider.com,
they'll just see a connection going to port 443 (HTTPS) to usenet.provider.com.
But the contents of the URL itself are only sent after SSL has initiated, thus
it's sent encrypted.

Of course, if your Usenet provider is using HTTP, your ISP can see everything.

I'm not sure if Usenet is seen as "bad" by ISPs, it isn't the "popular" option
these days so they might not really care.

The RIAA and MPAA will go to the provider and say, "person x has
been pirating y."  Your Internet provider will send you a warning
about piracy being illegal, blah, blah.  If you continue they will
start throttling your connection.  If you continue, they will start
forcing "piracy is illegal" landing pages to your browser.

The "punishment" varies a little from company to company, but that's

So I have a client currently using Network Solutions for email hosting.  They
have had issue after issue with over the last three months or so.  This is
seriously affecting their business as they are an online advertiser and do a
lot of business via email.

They want to go away from NS.  Who else would be recommended to move their
email to?  GoDaddy?  HostGator?  Someone else?

Good customer support (actually being able to talk to someone without waiting
an hour plus), reliability, no latency issues with delayed emails frequently,
allow us to control spam filter whitelists without having to put in a request
to have it done for us, etc.

They have about 50-100 email accounts, and currently are using a POP/SMTP
service, though I don't know if they'd be interested in IMAP.  Though, I will
say that since they do so much email, some have PSTs several gigabytes large.

Any suggestions would be welcome.  They are also considering getting a mail
server in house, but want to explore all options as that's a significant
upfront investment that they really aren't looking to do at the moment.  TIA!

Do NOT use Godaddy.  Their servers are slow and support is hit or miss.  Bad
news bears.  I'd second Google Apps--they can even import the PSTs if you want
to "centralize" all email on their servers.  But as WM suggested, it's pretty
pricey at this point.

Hostgator was good when I was hosting with them, as was Arvixe.  Arvixe is a
little (read: slightly) more expensive but crams less customers onto their
servers.  Always good support there as well.. 24x7 support by email, ticket
system, 800 number or live chat.  If reliability is what they're looking for,
that's where I'd start looking.

If the emails are already in PST files, you could just leave it there and have
them access the PSTs locally.  As long as they have some sort of backup
procedure in place for the PSTs (ie copying to a server regularly and including
in the backups) that gives them the most flexibility in moving to a new host in
the future.  AFAIK, once you convert your PSTs into Google Apps, you're kinda
stuck with it unless you want to move emails from IMAP individually.  :P

you said 50-100.  So if they're currently AT 50 it's only $2500 allowing them

plus as Ralph mentioned, with the groups functionality, and/or mail aliases,
and good filters in some cases redundant accounts can be removed and handled
by groups or aliases which can gain some savings

I totally understand the initial balking at the cost, but take a look at
all the other features that google apps provides.  It may allow them
