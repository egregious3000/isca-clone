We will soon be transferring the ISCABBS.COM domain name to a new
registrar.  Although we do not anticipate a service interruption
for any users, if you experience difficulty connecting to ISCA
over the coming days, it could be an unintended consequence of this
switch.  We have already transferred ISCABBS.ORG, so if you do have
trouble with ISCABBS.COM, you can connect through ISCABBS.ORG.
