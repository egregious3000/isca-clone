Users are free to change their usernames at any time, unless:
1. You have had a namechange in the last month
2. You have been kicked out from a forum in the last three months
3. You have been twitted out from a forum in the last six months

In the case of 2 and 3, the waiting period starts from the end of the twittal
or kickout eg if you were twitted for three days on March 2nd, you cannot have
a namechange until September 5th.

To change your ISCABBS account name:

1. Think of a name, 18 or fewer characters long (including spaces), and
<p>rofile it to make sure that it's not in use.

2. Mail> the FMs of any Invite Only fora you belong to to tell them you're
changing your name - and what to.

3. <y>ell to the Sysops and ask for your name to be changed.

There is further guidance for Guides, FMs, and members of invite-only fora in
the helpfile "Namechange".
