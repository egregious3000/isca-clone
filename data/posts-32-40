I'm a male in my late 30s.  For the last several years I have had to get up to
use the bathroom every night in the middle of the night. If I don't go I can
hold it til morning, but I wake up every few minutes from the discomfort.

I try to limit food/beverage intake before bed, but honestly, it doesn't seem
to make a difference what I do. We might be talking if I limit everything and
use the bathroom right before bed then I'm getting up around 4:00 and if I
don't limit everything and I don't go to the bathroom right before bed then I'm
up at 1:30.

I don't have any pain when I go, sometimes a little trouble getting the stream
started but not always.

I never had any problems sleeping through the night when I was a kid all the
way into my 20s.  Sure, I'd have to go first thing in the morning but I wasn't
waking up at night because of the urge to go either.

Thoughts? Normal for someone my age? Any behaviors I could try
altering/adopting/negating or medication that might help?

It might just be your body. Everyone is different, including different size
bladders. Mine is apparently the side of a plum, as I have had to get up to pee
almost every night as long as I can remember. My husband, and my oldest son
probably only have to pee like 3-4 times a day, even if they drink a lot of
fluids. Just people are different, I think, and our bodies change as we get
older, too.

I woke this morning to some discomfort in my chest.  It feels like it's maybe

I can breathe fine but if I fill my lungs I can feel the pain a little more.  I
did have a coughing fit about this time last week and had a similar pain then
but I thought it was gone.

The pain is pretty minor and is really just an annoyance at this point.  My
best guess is that I bruised a rib last week and maybe the way I slept last
night made the pain a little more noticable today.  Anything to be concerned
about?  I know it's hard to say without a real diagnosis but I just really
don't want to deal with the ER today.  I kind of figured I'd see if it
persisted into tomorrow and if so, make an appt with my GP.  Good plan?

The usual caveats apply: difficulty breathing, etc.- go to the ER. Otherwise,
call GP if it sticks around, or go to a doc-in-a-box urgent care clinic. If the
pain relents with exhalation, it's not cardiac. If there's only one pain, it's
not a spontaneous pneumothorax. Most likely, it's a muscle thing, and will go

Sounds more like Achilles tendonitis, although sometimes it goes alsong
withplantar fascitis, it can be all by itself an issue. I aw an orthopedist who
diagnosed first the p.fascitis, and then the achilles tendonitis. I decided
against surgery and it took a year of physical therapy and expensive but oh my
god so worth the instant relief shoes (MBT shoes)

And I ended up with just the Achilles tendinitis/tendonosis.

Achilles tendonitis, one thing is to keep the area warm and flexible-- that is
why it hurts most in the morning.... but you may need to rest the area, now
that there is so much pain. You may want to get new shoes that allow you to use
thick padding, and use a gel sleeve over each tendon area so your shoe does not
rub.

You want to be careful not to disregard tendonitis, those microtears can get
worse, or what is MUCH worse, create a situation where it can rupture.

QUOTE: Re: tendonitis/tendonosis: "Even in mild cases, it can take weeks to
months of rest for the tendon to repair itself. It's important to be patient
and not return too soon to sports and activities that stress the tendon."

A few days off has helped a lot.  It was little mermaid action this morning,
getting up, but the pain faded after about five minutes of moving around like

I'm going to wait until I get back to Aurora to take up exercise again, and
then I'm going to spend a week or two on the elliptical machine rather than the
track.  I might lose a bit of fitness, but hopefully that'll give it a chance

That is, if your doctor hasn't already scraped the rash and said "no yeast

I understand that I need to wait for the swelling to subside before anything
else can be done, so I'm fine with that. My question is, when I go back do I
see the same family doctor who treated me (he was on call since it was a
holiday) or do I see an ortho? Because of our ins I can schedule an appt with
anyone in the network without referral, so I don't have to worry about that. My
main thing is, we're a really active family, and even if it heals ok I want to
know what (if any) internal damage there is and have it repaired. I'm not
willing to give up skiing and snowboarding and tennis just yet, and still have
young kids that I do these activities with. So, I want that to be clear that we
are pretty active and wish to stay that way. The familiy doctor seemed pretty
"well if you don't notice problems, then no need to come back" and from the
amoutn of blood that was in my knee it seems there was some sort of internal
injury sustained, and I don't really want ot be hiking 10 miles from home on a
frozen lake and have my knee give in. So, would an ortho or someone else be
better?

within the network, since he doesn't actually work WITH any of them. Plus our
home clinic doesn't have their own MRI, which means seeing the doctor again
means another copay just to set up an MRI, and then a 2-3 week wait for the
mobile MRI to get to town, which because it's from a different place, is
another copay. I prefer to be more efficient if possible, lol. I really like my
doctor though, and he is willing to communicate by email so perhaps I will
discuss my concerns via email more in-depth before making a decision one way or
another.

You need to move to a less remote area!!!  I understand where you are coming
from. Living in remote area has it perks and it has its downside.  Because you
explained carrying a lot of weight while on trips then it would be good to Ask
all those questions to the PCP and have him refer you.  We did day hikes this
year in the Smoky Mountains and I didn't have any problems with the knee that I
injured.  I did not have a load on my back either.
Your concerns are valid and to have the answer you are looking for you need to
voice those concerns to your PCP.

Every Body is different on the healing process.  My knee took probably 3 months
to be able to walk up and down stairs without pain and problems.  I recall
going down was harder than going up.  We have a bilevel and so I was going up
and down the steps a lot. I think in the end it helped.  Since you are active
I'm sure that your healing might be quicker.  Good luck.
All your concerns I compeletly understand. Just make sure your PCP understands
why you are being so proactive.

I think making a normal appt will help, too. I went in as a walk in on xmas eve
and he was the only dr on call. He's a good dr but not my normal dr so I think
I'll follow up with my normal one who knows me better and will have the time to
listen during an actual appt. I stayed off advil today so I could better guage
how it was doing (I tend to overdo things when I feel like it's better) and the
swelling is going down, so the pain is different now. All along the inside of
the kneecap, about an 8 inch area, the top of the shin bone is sore and achy
too, and under the kneecap itself. The mobility is better (I can bend it a bit
more when I shuffle along) but I cannot lift it by my own power at all or twist
it side to side when I have it resting on the chair. It's so strange to not be
able to lift it, lol. I have to drag it behind me, or lift it with my hands
when I get in the car or into bed. Thanks, Bristow and everyone else. I
appreciate you letting me whine about it. I'm not used to being laid up and
it's really frustrating. I usually work out daily and am busy on weekends, so
being unable to do so makes me crabby plus I have to rely on everyone to do
everything for me. But, I'm thankful my kids are home so I can rest it well.

Artemis, I would definitely see an ortho even if you see your own doctor.  A
lot of ortho offices have their own x-rays and many have their own MRIs.  Even
if the place you make an appointment with does not have their own MRI, I bet
that when you call and you explain you're driving 2 hours to see them, they can
recommend a free-standing MRI clinic nearby.  That way, you can see the ortho
first and go to the clnic right after, you'd just have to schedule the MRI
before you go.  MRI clinics do not have long waiting times to get in, so your
chances are pretty good of being able to make an appointment the same day your
ortho visit is.  Make sure you get information on fasting from the MRI clinic
in ase you need to use dye and they want you to fast for that, or if they want
you with a full stomach, or if they don't care one way or the other.

MRi question>

So, after the first doctor told me to wait 3 weeks, I decided instead to see my
family doctor yesterday, who did a few pulling and twisting tests and said "No,
you need an MRI." So that'll be Wednesday.
My question on the MRI is, do they only do the area you are having examined?
Like will my head be sticking out of the tube? lol (it doesn't matter, I'm just
curious, I'm not claustrophobic)
Also, second, does the MRI take 360 degree images while I lay on my back or
will I have to change positions?
Lastly, I asked the nurse who registered me, and she said I wouldn't have to
remove my small tragus earring. But the form I have to fill out says to remove
all body piercings. It is titanium so not magnetic. So, do I go by the form or
what the lady told me?
Lastly, are tattoos really a concern? How so? I have one on my forearm and 2 on
my back, but they are all professionally done and several years old.

Depending on how the machine is set up, you may or may not have your entire

around (360 deg) without you having to change position. As for the piercing...
It will depend on the tech, how paranoid they are, and how much they understanf
about why metal needs to be removed (or not).  As you say, it's not magnetic. 
I once accidentally wore my watch in an MRI, and it was no big deal.  Mind you,

Have some puzzling symptoms, needs some input:  For about 3-4 weeks now, I've
had aching in my chest.  At  first I thought it was a cold or the flu coming
on, since it's going around EVERYWHERE right now, including members of my
household.  But during this entire time the aching/tightness in my chest hasn't
changed or gotten worse, and I haven't gotten a single other symptom.  No
congestion, no sore throat, no nothing.  It doesn't get any worse when I
exercise, and in fact I only notice it intermittently throughout the day. 
Generally, it's making me weary, but it's not the usual body aches of a flu. 
There are two things it feel like:  that 2-3 day period at the beginning of a
cold or flu, before the really bad symptoms come, or when I'm having SVT or PVC
(heart palpitations).  However, in the latter  case, I only feel this for hte
very short duration of hte symptoms -- seconds to at most an hour or two.

My hunch is that it's just a cold thing.  My husband has had lingering chest
congestion for 10 days not, but in his case it's obvious congestion.  So it
would make sense if I had a chest cold going on, too.  I'm just puzzled by the
fact that nothing is getting worse, and that there are no other symptoms. 
Until I thought of the heart connection, too, I wasn't in the least bit
concerned.  (I still think the heart thing is unlikely, but at this point I
don't know WHAT is going on.)

So... anyone ever experienced or heard of similar symptoms, or a cold that
presents like this?  This is really getting annoying!

So, a week ago I posted about some strange symptoms I was having (aching chest)
that I had narrowed down to either an otherwise-quiet upper respiratory
infection, or something to do with my heart.  Since then, it had either gotten
worse, or I've just been able to identify symptoms better, but I'm now positive
it's not a cold, etc., and fairly sure it's heart-related.  I called and made
an appointment with my cardiologist, but they had no openings for 2 weeks.  In
the meantime, I went to urgent care this morning (I have no PCP).  They did a
quickie EKG and a troponin test to rule out any damage to the heart (heart
attack, etc.)  All came back normal.  After discussing symptoms at length with
the urgent care doctor, he was still drawing a blank. At the very least, he
didn't see any reason to suspect some acute problem, and that waiting 2 weeks
to see my cardiologist seemed fine.

In the meantime, I've been better able to identify my symptoms:  it's a
tightness/squeezing in my chest.  It lasts anywhere from a few minutes to half
an hour, and is present roughly half of the time.  Small, everyday stresses
seem to set it off (reading an annoying email, hearing one of my kids cry after
getting hurt, rushing to a meeting, driving in traffic).  Nothing out of the
ordinary, though -- no true "stress".  And as I mentioned before, I'm
definitely having intermittent heart palipitations (a few per minute), but not
significantly more than I've ever had/noticed.  No SVT issues.  Exercising
does NOT increase the symptoms, and if anything temporarily relieves them.

So, what possibilities are left???  I'm only 39, thin, in rather good physical
shape, don't smoke, barely have any caffeine, etc.  Essentially, no risk

normal that most people simply don't notice much?  Certainly that seems to be
the case with my usual heart palpitations -- I just notice them more than mort
most people.  This kind of feels like that, with the volume turned up to 11.

Basically, it went away by itself and I hadn't even thought about it tuntil

My mom has been to the ER more than once with similar symptoms, she usually
wakes up with them. They have not found anything on any test, and have
basically attributed it to anxiety. Not saying that is your problem, just
throwing something else out there. She has a pretty stressful job (She is a
supervisor in the individual tax collection division for our state) and the
times it's happened it's always been during higher stress times of her job,
even though she didn't feel particuarly stressed out by the events. It still is
possible that it could be virus related, too. Keep an eye out for any shortness
of breath. Did they do an xray or any other scan? I ask because when my sister
was young she had similar symptoms, but later developed shortness of breath and
it turned out they never did an xray. if they had, they would have noticed her
heart was 3 times it's normal size. She was sent by ambulance (this was in like
1991, now she would go by copter) to a hospital several hours away. She had
developed an infection (no fever or typical infection symptoms) in the
pericardium. She had to have over 150 ccs of fluid drained from around her
heart and was in the hospital for 2 weeks. So, watch for any shortness of
breath or fatigue, just in case.

Rick Jenkins>  Will do, I'll definitely let you know what I figure out.

Artemis>  Great advice, thanks.  No imaging yet -- I'm guessing they'll do
something at my cardio appointment in 2 weeks.

So the topic of angina came up at my urgetn care visit today, so I've been
doing some reading.  While it's commonly associated with older people and chest
pain due to coronary blockages, etc., if I understand it correctly it actually
refers more breadly to any chest pain caused by decreased oxygen to the heart,
which can be caused by a number of factors, including emotional and/or physical
stress, irregular heart rhythms (yup, have those), hyperthyroidism (don't have
that, but due have some endocrine issues, including a pituitary tumor), etc. 
So thinking about the whole oxygen issue got me thinking a little more broadly,
and wondering if some sort of otherwise-asymptomatic upper respiratory
infection is contributing?  Is that too far fetched?  I Only think of it
because my husband has had lingering chest congestion for a while, and I had
severe bronchitis a few months ago...  Hmmm, all things to discuss with the
cardio, I guess!

Artemis, I had something similar happen.  I'd been having RA symptoms on and
off for a long time, every time I had a flare I'd make an appointment, it would
take me several weeks to get in and by the time it rolled around my flare would
be gone.  I finally just said screw it and went to the doctor anyway.  He
dismissed me and told me to take Aleve.  I went home and said screw that and I
made an appointment with a specialist.  By the time that appointment came
around, I had had such a severe flare I wasn't able to walk most days.  That
doctor could physically see how bad I was hobbling around and he gave me
steroids while my blood tests were pending.  The steroids were a miracle, and
my tests came back clear, no inflammation but it was so incredibly obvious that
I did have a shit ton of inflammation.  You can test clear with RA but still
have it, and now I'm on steroids and another drug and I haven't been able to
move this freely in probably over a year.  I had seriously thought that a lot
of it was just normal aging, but it sure as hell wasn't.  I was just seriously
pissed that my doctor dismissed my symptoms

People die from RA.  Someone I knew died just before I was diagnosed from
sepsis.  She also was the first person in the world to get an umbilical cord
stem cell transplant to treat the RA.  Sadly, the treatment took 100%.
(umbilical cord blood stem cells, not from the umbilical cord itself).  She
never got to enjoy her success.  I don't need a doctor who is going to
ignore what I say, especially when my health could be seriously compromised and

They've done some studies, and they found it doesn't work any better than
placebo.  They switched it out on people who were tkaing the drug and sayig it
worked and they continued to say it worked even though they weren't taking it
anymore.  Also, the pills have something like 1/1000th or 1/10000th of the
glucosamine already produced by your body.  So you're adding such a tiny little
amount that it's hard to think that it's going to hae a major affect.  The
trials that have shown it to work have all had some sort of flaw.  One study
actually was going to measure changes in cartilage, but ended up not being able
to do so and they measured subjective pain instead.  They weren't able to
measure physical changes because there weren't any.  G + C are used in
formation, repair and uh...the ability of cartilage to go back to how it was
after being squished or stretched.  When they are taken, they can't see any
changes.

It seems to be a really good placebo, and it can't hurt to take it.  If you
struggle with taking pills and you don't want to have to deal with pills, then
you're not going to hinder your recovery.  My knee surgeon was an older guy and
he said to try G+C before he'd do stuff to my knee (which ended up being
something that G+C couldn't have fixed anyway).  My hip surgeon, a much younger
guy, and my wrist surgeon both said not to bother with it if I didn't want to,
but if it makes me feel better with the idea that it might help, then take it.

damaged when I hurt my knee, so it's not degenerative. It's worth a try, I
think. it's not exactly expensive stuff, so I think i'll see what happens. I
appreciate everyone's input! FWIW some studies also say fish oil doesn't make

Primary GAIT Study Results: February 2006

Researchers led by rheumatologist Daniel O. Clegg, M.D., of the University of
Utah School of Medicine, conducted the 4-year primary GAIT study at 16 sites.
The results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, February 22,
2006, showed that the popular dietary supplement combination of glucosamine
plus chondroitin sulfate did not provide significant relief from osteoarthritis
pain among all participants. However, a smaller subgroup of study participants
with moderate-to-severe pain showed significant relief with the combined
supplements.

Fish oil is another example of how one can fail to get results from food
derivatives that are based on observational studies.

So, for example, someone looks at a population that eats a lot of cold-water
fish and notes they have less heart disease or whatever, and- well, heck. Must
be the fish oil! So, extract it, purify it (distillation to remove heavy
metals), bottle it under nitrogen to reduce oxidation, ship it, swill it- and
fail to derive the results. WTF?

And we see this again and again: "anti-oxidant" foods, and then the
encapsulated antioxidants fail to show results. Lots of fresh veggies, but
powdered vegetable fiber doesn't seem to help. Foods with lutein and zeaxanthin
promise eye benefits, but the extracts don't seem to work. And so on.

Interestingly, fish oil may have one clear-cut benefit: those with MS on the
so-called "Swank Diet," by Dr. Roy Swank. While the low saturated fats aspect
is pure nonsense, the recommendation of fish oil may be protective. However,
Swank's work lacked double-blinding, and remains without conclusive study.

I get that studies don't always show results. But studies are usually biased
anyhow, despite the fact they aren't supposed to be. I read them but I don't
always put a ton of weight on them. Whole food versions are always best, there
is no doubt there. But in some cases it's difficult to afford, or be able to
eat enough, of the foods. There are studies that show taking vitamin D doesn't
do much even. For me, it does, because my test results prove it. Would it be
better for me to be able to take in all that vitamin D from leafy greens? Sure.
And I eat quite a lot of them. But not enough to compensate on a daily basis
for the fact that the sun is only high enough in the sky for my body to even
attempt to benefit, 2 months out of the year. I was deficient. I started taking
a supplement, I am no longer deficient. Many people I know benefitted from fish
oil, as shown in their tests. I don't expect C/C to heal my knee. With all I've
heard, I wonder if maybe it might help a bit, not necessarily to grow the other
cartilage, but to possible aid in faster restoration of range of motion. The
answer seems to be "maybe" and since taking it won't hurt me and isn't going to
break the bank to take for a few months, then why not. If it works, great. If
it is a placebo and makes me think it works? Great. If it doesn't work at all,
no harm done.

Of course, some supplements can hurt, and some of them can lull people into a
false state of thinking all their problems can, and should be, cured. My mom is
one of those people, she takes like 16 supplements a day after her naturopath
told her that diet doesn't matter, she can eat chips and dip all day long
because even if she eats veggies, the soil is so bad that she isn't getting
nutrients anyhow. So, eat how you want, take my $200 a month worth of
supplements and you'll be fine. And my mom buys it. Frustrates the crap out of

Vitamins and minerals and supplements, oh my!

I take a metric fuckton of pills every day.  But I only take the ones that have
demonstrated their use to me.  When I'm contemplating adding something to the
mix, I'll research it first.  If the worst it'll do is "not much," I'll give
just about anything a fair shot.  I'll take it for a few weeks, and record
whatever it is I'm trying to affect by taking it.

For an example, I'll give you the vitamin D that Artemis referenced.  My
research indicated that for bad stuff to happen, you have to take 50,000 IUs a
day, every day, for several months, to build up toxic levels in your system.
And then you get poor appetite, nausea, and vomiting.  Ok, I'm taking 6,000 IUs
a day.  So I have years before I'd have to worry about building up a toxic
level, but I won't, because my body's using the stuff before then.

I started looking at vitamin D to help with depression.  I'm not an outdoors
kind of person, and when I am outside, I'm either wrapped up in multiple layers
of clothing, or slathered in high-SPF sunscreen.  Plus I've always had the
appetite of a 12 year old boy.  =)  (Yes, I'm working on changing that!)

After a month of charting my mood, with vitamin D being the only change I'd
made, my mood had improved.  With any supplement I added and charted like this,
I gave it two months to see any positive results.  If I did, it stayed in the
regimen.  If not, then not.  I don't _think_ too much of it (if any) is placebo
effect, because I hate taking pills and tend to be very skeptical.  But even if
it is placebo effect, my whatever is feeling better, so I'm happy.

managed by government, I wouldn't expect swift changes. The only way to really
know exactly what you need is to have a doctor run a test to see what your
level is, then they can recommend a dose to catch you up, and a maintainence
dose. I take 3000IU a day in the winter, and 2000IU a day in the summer (and I

The way the daily reference intake (DRI- used to be called the RDA) is
calculated is key: first off, it relies upon acute deficiency. For vitamin D,
that includes rickets. So, the amount of vitamin D you need (as per the DRI) is
the amount required to stave off rickets (I'm not sure if other acute symptoms
of vitamin D deficiency weigh into it or not). For that, it is sufficiency for
2 standard deviations of the sample group tested, minus the low end (the end
for which a smaller amount is just fine). So, that's 95% +/- 2.5%, or
sufficiency for 97.5% of people tested. That's pretty good.

However, for vitamin D, we still have no clue what it may take to treat chronic
medical issues, or prevent disease- cancer, autoimmune disease, depression,
etc. Those results may take a much longer time to come in.

The main problem with bumping up the vitamin D supplementation is that the
Brits screwed it up for everyone a few decades back: they started supplementing
all kinds of foods, and ended up poisoning quite a few people. It's painful,
but the symptoms of hypervitaminosis D all eventually go away without sequelae.
(We had the same thing happen to some "health guru" who poisoned himself with
his own brand of vitamin supplement; I like to think some nitwit on the
processing line added X millgrams of vitamin D instead of X international units
of vitamin D.)

Anyway, a bunch of people got poisoned, and that weighs heavily on the
regulatory "conscience" of trying it again. It's a stupid reason, but it's
another reason why it's kept so low.

In short: because there's no firm data on chronic effects of hypovitaminosis D,
and because of bad experiences in the past from hypervitaminosis D. Stuck
between heaven and hell.

Self-created capital assets aren't capital assets if they're in the posession

It does depend. If you own a web design firm and you pay a designer to design
a web site for a non-profit, then you can deduct their labor.

HOWEVER, if you don't pay them for the design work, that's not deductible.

Pub 526 is pretty clear on this. Time is not deductible. Neither are capital
assets you've created for donation to the organization.

Plumber pays an apprentice to re-do the shitter at his church: the apprentice's
time and any materials are deductible. If he pays himself (from his business)
that's ALSO deductible. If he does not get paid, only the materials are
deductible.

Web design firm does pro-bono work for the church: Any time the company pays
its employees for is deductible. If the employees work for free, that's NOT
deductible.

There's a lot of misconception about this stuff, so it wouldn't surprise me if
your web designer friends are improperly deducting this stuff and just haven't
been caught yet.

Now, you can charge the group $1k for the site, then donate that $1k back to
the organization... that's deductible... but it also increases your income...
so it's either a wash or you lose money on the deal.

It's also possible that the software companies are doing this out of a sense of

Yeah... if a worker is paid for their time and the company donates the work
product then the company can write off the amount they paid their workers (not
the retail value of whatever it is).

So, a more concrete example. Joe is a web designer. He works for FancyPants Web
Design. The owner of FancyPants takes on a pro-bono job for Some Church.

Joe makes $35/hour. It takes him 15 hours to complete the site. The company
bills him at $100/hr so a 15-hour web site would cost $1500.

During the course of this thing, Joe uses $20 worth of paper, pens, etc. He
also registers a domain name ($10) and gets hosting ($100).

FancyPants (not Joe) can deduct $655 (the $525 they paid Joe + materials +
domain + hosting).

Joe can't deduct anything.

On the other hand, if Joe OWNS FancyPants and forgos payment. They most they
can deduct is $130 (materials + domain + hosting). Same deal if Joe doesn't own
the company, but forgos payment of his normal hourly rate.

to deduct $1,000 and only add $1,000 to your income - but with $1,000 in
additional income you not only owe additional income taxes, there are all those

Take your previous year's total tax due.
As long as you've paid in at least 110% of that this year, you will not be

I tend to get a few thousand back each year, so I regularly pay in more than
110% of the previous year's actual tax due.

So this year, even though I made considerably more than last year, I wasn't
penalized for underpayment (I made no estimate payments) because my standard
withholding was over 110% of last year's total tax due.

VA tax returns start with federal AGI and make adjustments from there. Looks
like VA decided to not tax long term capital gains this year, but they would be
included in federal AGI, so they start with that number and subtract the LTG.
Especially if that's all the income you claimed while living in VA, and had
no tax withheld, those numbers could make sense (and if your income in KY did
have withholding, that would make that refund also make sense). TT didn't have
to ask about what income was attributable to VA, because it had the KY info and
those were the only two states you listed. And it wouldn't have mattered
anyway, if your only income in VA was capital gains and not taxable.

Every tax software package I've seen has offered a deal at some point during
the season to get at least the Federal package (with efiling) for under $20.
This year, I think I got Federal, one state, and five free Federal efile codes
for under $50. We filed five returns with it. Sure, it would have been an extra
$20/person to efile the state returns, but we're all too cheap for that, so
those we printed and mailed. But honestly, I'd probably do those by hand before
I paid extra for it. My income is way too high to qualify for any efile deals,
and I'm cheap. And filing by hand is so much easier than it used to be. Put the
whole thing in a spreadsheet just to make sure there are no calculation errors,
and then transpose all the numbers to a fillable PDF and you could print a
return that looks as good as anything the tax software puts out. I'm just too
lazy to want to create the formula to calculate Federal tax, and not quite that
cheap, so I'll probably always efile Federal. Everyone else may have to deal
with my paper returns unless they want to offer me a way to do it for free.
(That said, something like 60% or 70% of Americans do qualify for free efile
just due to income levels.)

they would give a free state e-file instead of the other four federal e-files.
Anyway, that sale price and rebate offer have been pretty consistant for at

For turbotax online there's invariably 25-35% discounts available through a
number of financial institutions (that you don't need an account with to use
the discount link)

For example-

http://personal.fidelity.com/planning/tax/do_your_taxes.shtml

Use the "visitor entry" link if not a customer.  25% off both federal and
state.

(I think BoA offered 35%, but only on federal, nothing off state- so which deal
is better depends what you're filing)

You don't need deluxe software for that. All you need to do is fill in a

automatically flow through to the 1040. If there isn't, the software should
automatically put the standard deduction in instead. All those software
packages like to advertise that the more expensive software somehow helps you
itemize better, but I have yet to figure out how this supposed to happen. You
have to come up with the info regardless of what package you use, and if you
put all the right info in, you'll get the max deduction, even for the base
version.

Make up names and SSNs but put in all the same numbers and see what it comes

  Wife and I are forming an LLC. Here in Texas, you can pass thru or act
  like an s corp (without needing to form one, do all the "meetings" etc).
  We've hired some dev's via elance, and it pretty clearly says that if

  to either.

http://help.elance.com/entries/34202-how-do-i-use-elance-s-1099-service

  We get a recommendation for a CPA (from the lawyer who will be forming
  the LLC) and she says:

Okay here is the rule for payments to foreign individuals. You do not issue
them a 1099-Misc, however, they are subject to a mandatory 30% withholding that
you remit to the IRS at least quarterly and report annually on a Form 1042,
then you also have to file a Form 1042S which is basically the equivalent of a
1099-Misc. You need to get the foreign individuals to complete a Form W-8Ben if
they want to claim exemption from the 30% withholding  - meaning they are
subject to a tax treaty with the US or a Form W-8ECI which states that their
income is connected to the conduct of business in the US - meaning they will
file a US tax return.  I know this is confusing so call if you have any
questions.

  So, she full of it?

That kind of thing happens all the time when you have one salaried wage earner
in the household, and the other earner picks up small freelancing or part-time
work from several different contracts or employers.  The salaried earner's
income is withheld based on their salary bracket, and the secondary earner has
little-to-no taxes withheld since the gross from each job is below the
so-called poverty line.  Then when April 15th comes, they realize the total
earned from the freelance and part-time jobs is substantial, say, another 50K.
Blammo!! That's 50K they didn't pay taxes on *at all*, and on top of that, the
salaried earner didn't pay enough out of each pay check.

That bed and breakfast trip across Northern Italy you were planning this
summer might as well be a flight on the space shuttle. Better start preparing
your nostrils for the Jersey shore, bayside.  Or maybe that trip to see Aunt

Actually, depending on the size of the employer, they are required the remit
any taxes they withhold on your behalf no less often than quarterly, and
possibly as freqently as "within 24 hours of the paychecks being mailed". Why
yes, I have worked in tax departments where we had multi-million dollar
payrolls with this requirement, and yes it was a major pain in my ass when
management decided to award random bonuses with almost no notice to me. :P

I would add that if you earn both W2 and self-employment income you can
increase your witholdings from the employer instead of making the estimated tax
payments (just make sure it's enough).  I'm not sure, but would assume you
could do the same with any W2 earner that will be on the tax return.  In other
words, wife earns W2 income, husband earns SE, they file a joint return, wife
can withold more and husband none.  However, that usually works better if the
W2 earner makes almost as much or more than the SE earner.
The key no matter how you do it, is to make sure the govt. gets it's money at
least every 3 months.  When I calculated what I needed to withold I just used
some tax software and did a mock return to see how much tax I would have paid
the previous year and then divided it up.

Another note on the home office deduction. You have to use that space (that you
deduct) EXCLUSIVELY for business. So, if you deduct your spare bedroom and have
a computer located in there you can't use it for personal use. At all.

The only exceptions to these rules are for daycare and storing inventory if
those apply to your business.

The spot must also be easily identifiable.

The amount of space that you end up deducting once you correct for the
exclusivity (by having a second desk with a second computer that you use for
personal stuff, for instance) makes it kind of a pain in the ass to claim it.
Even though I do have a pretty specific spot where I conduct business and my
desktop computer there is used 99.9% of the time for business purposes, there
are personal files on the computer so I don't meet the home office deduction
requirements.

It's also not like this is a HUGE deduction either (at least not around here)
lets say I deduct a 10x10 room from my 3200 square foot house. That's 3.125% of
my house. The total with utilities and everything would be less than $100/mo.
While a $1200 deduction isn't pennies (it'd reduce my tax burden by about $350
or so) it's not exactly a game changer compared to the pain in the ass of
taking it.

On the other hand, the rules for claiming the home office deduction are such
that if you could have claimed it, you lose the personal exemption for
non-commercial use of your home in regards to capital gains and such, whether
or not you actually bother to claim the deduction. Whether or not you could
have claimed the deduction may be a question of interpretation which may or may
not mean a fight with IRS. But if you think you could have claimed the
deduction, you might as well, in order to make up the loss in exemption you'll
be dealing with later. Also, if you have a space that you could claim is
exclusively for business, but you do something minor there that is personal
just to kill your home office deduction so you don't have to lose the personal
exemption, you might get some questions. It's all very complicated, which is
why this is an area you cannot wait until next spring when it's time to file
the return to consult with a professional. By then, everything is done and you
can't change how you've set it up, and it's too late. Consult a professional

personal exemption and is now subject to full capital gains. In my case, client
bought a house fairly cheaply long, long, long ago and gradually expanded it
as their family grew. Some years after that, all the kids had moved out and
client was left with a very large, mostly empty, beautiful house. Client was
self-employed as an interior decorator and decided to use the space not just as
her home office, but as a sort of exhibit space of her work. Did not use it for
anything else. Ended up with a good third of the house as a home office.
Decided one year without consulting her accountant to downsize the business,
sell the house, and move somewhere smaller. This was more than ten years ago,
long before the housing market crash. The capital gains on the house sale were
in the six figures and with a third of that subject to capital gains, the tax
bill was enormous. If she'd talked to us we could have suggested transitioning
over a couple of years, getting a good two years of personal only (no business)
use of the home, maybe some other tax mitigating strategies (let the business
build up a couple of years of losses, if she wanted to put less work into it),
something. But no, my firm didn't find out what she'd done until the following
spring when she sent us the closing statements from the sale and purchase and
it was too late to help her.

Quickbooks? Quicken is generally the standard, non-business version. Basically
just checkbook software. Quickbooks will be the full accounting software. The
main other version at that price point is Peachtree, which has some extra
features, but is really much, much, much harder for a non-accountant to use. I
generally recommend Quickbooks to my clients.

(Standard deduction has nothing to do with home office. Home office is a
deduction on schedule C, which is totally unrelated from itemized deductions on
schedule A.)

Oh, that reminds me, Clark Howard recently discussed why you should not let the
IRS withold money like that in favor of big refunds... beyond giving them the
famous "interest-free loan", there's now a significantly increased risk that if
you become a victim of identity theft, that refund could be delayed.

By a year and a half.

ID scammers have now latched onto filing your taxes before you do in hopes of
scoring a huge refund sent directly to them. If your identity is stolen and
used for this purpose, it is taking the IRS nearly 18 months to discover the
fraud, find out what happened to their money, and then process your legitimate
paperwork and refund. Last year the IRS lost nearly $2 billion dollars last
year alone.

It's better to set your money aside in a secure savings account and pay up what
you need to, rather than having what is truly yours be stolen and having to
wait to get it back.

Ive been using gnucash. When something like what John Public describes happens
within my accounts, i code the reversal the same as the charge or credit it
reverses. Example, i would code the INTL POS FEE as an expense and its amount
in the withdrawal column. I would then code the REVERSAL as an expense with its
amount in the deposit column. Seems to work for me, but like him I'm curious if
there's a better way. I wouldn't think coding the reversal as "income" would be
the right way to go.

This is really more accounting than tax. In a true, double entry accounting
accounting system, I'd want to track that sort of transaction separately, call
it something like "expense category - Refund" maybe, and then deduct it from
the initial expense category at the end of the year. In some accounting
systems, it's possible to do that by classifying it as its own income category
associated with the expense item without affecting regular income, but that may
not be possible in some lower end systems, in which case using another expense
category may be the way to go. But really, in the end, accounting systems
should be designed to give you the information *you* need, and if you don't
care, just stick back in the original expense category and you'll get the same
numbers at the end of the year. IRS only requires very broad information about
financial transactions, and SEC isn't much different. All the detail work is
generally for the business themselves so they can have better information for
making better decisions.

But just dropping that off at goodwill will "net" you roughly your tax bracket
back on the value... so if a shirt is worth $20, and you're in the 25% bracket,
you're "getting" about $5 off your taxes net for donating it roughly.


For used clothing that might well be a pretty good value compared to selling it
on craiglist, because people don't pay much for used clothing typically.

For a valuable work of art you can probably do better than 25% of value.

So depends on the item.

the Fiscal Cliff (called that because they all happen at once)..

The military cuts are just part of the overall 10% budget cuts.... the problem
is that the military has absolutely no say where those cuts will come from...
they just have to cut every program (iucluding nuclear weapons maintenance,
security, body armor, ship maintenance, aircraft orders, toilet paper....
EVERYTHING).  Many of the upper military leaders say they could surgically cut
10% out of their budget.... but the accross the board is dangerous.

Interestingly.. the Republicans were the ones behind the bill in the House...

voted for it in the Senate.  It passed with a pretty major majority in both

Sorry if I took this out of context or misunderstood - I didn't read
the previous discussion in detail.

I'm not sure if this will be relevant in 20 years: when I read lord of
the rings, I wasn't even aware of all the background information on
the world of Tolkien, even though it had certainly been discussed to
death already.  I read the books coming from a blank slate, and
happened to enjoy them a lot.  I know others from the same year that
didn't enjoy them at all, but I'm quite sure they also didn't read the
background stuff.

Only when I got into roleplaying and re-read the books for the third
time or so, did I read some of the background stuff.  I still only
read very little of it.  Do you really think future readers will be
influenced by all this background discussion on the Harry Potter
series _before_ they finish reading the books?  I expect most will
just read the books not knowing about all the surrounding discussions.

As for Dumbledore - I don't recall much character development details
regarding him in the books, and I certainly never thought about him
being gay or not based on the books.  Seems like an afterthought to
bring it up now, rather irrelevant.  Perhaps it was relevant for
Rowling while writing, but I doubt I'll even think about it if I read
the whole series again.

Tolkien was -- the place she shines is imagination and narrative, whereas
Tolkien had a tremendous grasp of historical and linguistic facets, to boot --

I have no problem with Dumberdore being gay.  I appreciate that JKR is trying
to advance social acceptance of homosexuality by presenting sympathetic
characters to young readers who are homosexual.

It'd be one thing if the text provided this information, and it was a part of
Dumbledore's character.  It doesn't because they are books for children and if
a main character was presented as homosexual, there would be outrage and
controversy that neither JKR nor the publisher wants to deal with.

So it's not in there.  To tack it on afterwards and say, "Oh, yeah, that

I don't think it diminishes the books, characters, or story in any way.  I just
find it incredibly cynical, in a commercial sense, to offer a political
declaration about a character on a lightning rod issue, but only *after* the
books are highly successful and carried forth on their own interia, so that
this particular element has no chance of commercially derailing the franchise.

Well, I don't know that she had it planned out from before book 1...

But I can EASILY buy that when the series got the point she was developing the
overall backstory on both Dumbledore and the Hallows that she had to consider
things like Dumbledores motivations earlier in his life, and could certainly
have concluded the gay thing made sense at this point, especially in the
context of the Grindlewald relationship.


The alternative is either that:

She came up with it on the spot for that question, and then just lied and made
up all the backstory part and the bit about the note to the script writer.

OR

She came up with it after writing the whole series but then didn't bother to
mention it until a fair bit later when someone in a Q&A asked about it.

Here's a transcript of the question/answer for some context BTW-


Did Dumbledore, who believed in the prevailing power of love, ever fall in love
himself?

My truthful answer to you... I always thought of Dumbledore as gay. [ovation.]
.... Dumbledore fell in love with Grindelwald, and that that added to his horror
when Grindelwald showed himself to be what he was. To an extent, do we say it
excused Dumbledore a little more because falling in love can blind us to an
extent? But, he met someone as brilliant as he was, and rather like Bellatrix
he was very drawn to this brilliant person, and horribly, terribly let down by
him. Yeah, that's how i always saw Dumbledore. In fact, recently I was in a
script read through for the sixth film, and they had Dumbledore saying a line
to Harry early in the script saying I knew a girl once, whose hair...
[laughter]. I had to write a little note in the margin and slide it along to
the scriptwriter, "Dumbledore's gay!" [laughter] If I'd known it would make you
so happy, I would have announced it years ago!

Re: transformed novel

I dunno, I can see it, but again if we're using the Potter books as examples, I
don't really see it. They're books. They're novels. I can go get them and know
nothing whatsoever about the website(s). I think if you had something where you
needed the site to finish the novel or such, that would be a huge
transformation, yeah.

But right now, I just don't see that happening. She's doing the equivalent of
releasing "The Potter Encyclopedia" or "The Companion to the World of Harry
Potter", she's just doing it online I guess, instead of as a book, and it
wouldn't really surprise me to see the online thing produce a book. Once stuff
gets fleshed out enough and there's enough info for it, maybe let readers get
involved, I can see a book like the companion getting produced, based on what's
on the site. But I guess I'm still not seeing enough evidence for the
transformation of the novel as we know it, not from this series alone, at any

There's two kinds of authors: those who plan extensively and those who
improvise extensively.  All the indications are that she is a planner.  As a
planner myself, I often figure out the details of a character's backstory in
far more detail than will ever end up in the story, mostly because I don't want
to be stuck suddenly having to figure out a character's middle name if it
*does* come up in the writing.

Sexuality is one fo the very first thing I figure out.  It's not even slightly
unlikely that she would know quite a lot about each of these characters'
psychology on a level that would never end up in the books.

Now, whether it *matters* is a matter of literary interpretation, and her
saying "he's gay" doesn't make it canon.  It's one interpretation, no matter
when she came up with it, of the story.  As a literary critic, I'd give it
pretty much equal weight with any other reasonable reading of the book.  When
Bradbury recently insisted that F. 451 was really about the dangers of
television, and not about censorship, I discounted it as a clumsy and not very
interesting reading of the book, just as I would if some other literary critic
said the same thing.

     telling, likely at the behest of the publisher, who wanted no suggestion
     of any kind that the main character of a children's book was a homosexual,
     because it would create controversy and impact sales; only after the saga
     was successful was this fact allowed to be revealed, and even then, the
     evidence of it in the text is scant.

 (b) it was made up on the spot, or at least well after the books were
     successful, as a bone thrown to political correctness and progressive
     ideals about human sexuality

Neither is an attack on JKR.  If anything, I'm cynical about her publisher.

Of course it's possible, but to me that's like saying that a character was
always intended to be Latino, even though his name is "Bill Jones," he's never
shown to speak Spanish, and there's no evidence of Latino cultural influences
on his character in any element of the text.

Something like sexuality is a huge influence on a person's personality and
psychology, and there's little reason to decide that a character is gay (or
straight, for that matter) unless it's important in some way to the narrative.

Strider is clearly straight in Lord of the Rings, and it's important because he
marries Liv Tyler and re-unites the two broken lines.

However, Frodo's sexuality is ambiguous.  He's never shown in the text to have
any sexuality of any kind, and that's because it's not really important in any
way to the narrative.  If Tolkien were to tell us today that he meant for Frodo
to be gay all along, it doesn't really alter the story any.  We might interpret
certain passages pertaining to Sam differently, but the text provides little to
no evidence that Frodo was in love with Sam and somehow conflicted about Sam
being in love with Rose.  It's not part of the story, it's not important,
there's no story arc or character development associated with it.

Now, I know that JKR is (like Tolkien) a planner, and they planned a massive
amount of background material, but I expect something that is that crucial to a
person's psychological composition (unlike, say, Ron's dad being an avid poker
player) to manifest in AT LEAST SOME manner in the story, and if it doesn't, I
take that as persuasive evidence that that particular element was not
considered by the author.  That doesn't mean she thought, "DD is straight" and
later changed her mind, I just have serious doubts that she gave thoughtful
consideration to so critical an element of his character, yet neglected to
place any evidence of that element into the text.

"The story never necessitated it."  Right, because it wasn't there.

This is all chicken-and-egg bullshit, and I'll allow that my perception is
perhaps too much biased by own fiction writing style, which is somewhat
Hermingwayian and minimalist.

I have actually written one short story in which I clearly envisioned that the
the protagonist was homosexual, and I also envisioned that this was not going
to be a major part of the story, but indicia nevertheless come into the story.
I am simply psychologically incapable of picturing a situation in which I write
a character who is gay, and where NOT A SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE of that
element materializes after six books and thousands of pages of published
material concerning that character.

So, place the failing on me, I suppose.

I have enjoyed reading your views, Lochner, but I find a couple of 
things that make me believe otherwise. 
 
First off, if the publishers thought that Dumbledore's sexuality would 
impact sales, they probably thought it would do so positively. 
Controversy over Harry Potter being 'unchristian' certainly helped the 
series appear in quite a few non-review-type articles, for instance. 

Second, I question whether being gay changes a person's perspective so 
recognizably as you think. Would I not still be myself if my sexuality 
were different? If I were writing a spy story, with no romance amid the 
secrets and action, would the participants' behaviors change if on the 
third rewrite I decided that Agent X was gay? Naturally, one can write 
the sexuality of any character impacting the story: but I think a 
writer can also write it without such a fingerprint showing up. 

And there are things, like Dumbledore's unmarried state, that strike me 
as being more likely for a gay man. Most of the men I know over (what 
is Dumbledore? 60?) have been married, even if they are not currently. 
Gandalf, whom he certainly resembles role-wise, keeps his single-hood 
by being nomadic, and completely taken up with affairs of overwhelming 
importance. Dumbledore has a rooted, established existence, and is 
painted as caring deeply for those around him, in a very hands-on, 
consistent way; has no woman ever wanted to share his life? Has no 
woman ever caught at his heart? Has no woman's name ever even been 
linked with his? 

Anyway, I do think that the signs point to Rowling having always meant 
Dumbledore to be gay, and, similarly, always meant it to affect 
backstory only, not the current Harry-Potter plot.

 It's a hunch, I admit, and I'm probably hopelessly biased on this
 point because of how I write characters.

"Anyway, I do think that the signs point to Rowling having always meant
Dumbledore to be gay, and, similarly, always meant it to affect
backstory only, not the current Harry-Potter plot. "

  It doesn't have to affect the plot, but it would affect the character
  arc, that's storytelling 101.

I'll be honest.  One of my best friends is gay.  My cousin who was practically
my brother growing up is gay.  I did not get the slightest sense that
Dumbledore was gay until after I had read the books and the whole discussion
started up after JKR said something.  But whether he is or is not.  Does it
really matter?  Not to me.  It was a great story, Dumbledore is a strong
character who is likable and has the best interests of his students at heart. 
In short he's everything I wanted in a teacher and mentor growing up.  You
don't really know if any of the professors are married or dating or not.  Their
sexual appetites has nothing to do with the school environment or the stories.

1) None of the wizards in ME, to the best of my knowledge, took up with anyone
-- even the relatively non-nomaidc guys.  Maybe it just wasn't part of their
persona.
2) In all honesty, as a young person, I definitely grew uncomfortable with the
closness of Sam and Frodo in Mordor, what with Sam's loving gaze and whispered
sweet nothings.  Upon (multiple) re-readings, it no longer impacts me as it
did, but I do still kinda-sorta wonder just a bit.
3) Sexuality can be, IMHO, compared to the "loaded gun in a story must be used"
bit.  Irrespective of how it informs the character, once you introduce
sexuality, you have to *do* something with it.  Leaving his sexual preference
out is really the only thing that makes sense from a literary perspective,
unless there was going to be a whole "Dumbledore's Sexuality" tangent -- past
loves, discussion of how it had affected him, etc.  I mean, it's not like
Harry's going to bump into "The Joy of Gay Love" while going through
Dumbledore's stuff.                        ^^ Sex

Well, Orson Scott Card's works make lots of people uncomfortable! :)

Most of the sexuality of the adults in the HP novels doesn't matter
at all, except when they get married or widowed.  I don't specifically
remember if they say Minerva was ever married (although I see on Wiki
she's a widow, so I must have missed it) but if she was a lesbian it
wouldn't change much in her relations with her students.

Dumbledore being gay would matter in his backstory and how he grew
up, but he could end up in exactly the same place we saw him in
the first 5 or 6 books regardless of his sexuality, so it really didn't
matter until that point.

Then again, I read most of Gamain's "Nancy Boys" without knowing the
characters were almost all black, so I might not be the best judge.

Well, Lochner, let me drop the only part of my point you answered 
(whether I would be a different person given a different sexuality), 
and ask you the more applicable question: should the reader always be 
able to tell from the words and actions of a character what his or her 
sexuality is, if the author knows it when writing the story? 
 
Now, Dumbledore could have had a boy-crush on Grindenwald (name?), or 
he could have been intellectually tempted by a charismatic friend before 
realizing the good-evil balance falls against him, or he could have been 
gay and in love with the guy, or ... well, you are a writer. I am sure 
you can see that there is more than one motivation for Dumbledore to act 
as he did for every step of the book. 

However, when I heard that Dumbledore was gay, I thought, "of course, 
he is!" I thought it fit in very well with the character, and, given 
Rowling's known habit of filling in back-story (Ron's Patronus animal, 
Hagrid's wand-wood, how Harry's Muggle grandparents died), I do not find 
enough cause to doubt the official story this time. 
 
It probably will not convince you. I hope you still enjoy the books, 
though, whether you think that tidbit was a publicity-affected bit of 
trivia or not.

Books and films don't always have the same structure, nor should they. The Tom
Bombadil episode was fun but would have been a distraction from the already
complex storyline of the LOTR. There are a couple of allusions to Bombadil in
Jackson's films, however.  Another change from the books is that the Hobbits do
not return to the pillaged shire and expell Sharky and fellow villians. Again,
this was acceptable since the narrative of the film can't handle such a long
epilogue following the epic battles that have already been fought. But there is
an allusion to the scouring of the Shire in the scene where Frodo looks into
Galadriel's mirror.

in the movie it was twelve scenes later and Gandalf said it. It's like, OK,
you're going to accurately give the dialogue, why the hell did that person say
it then? I don't have any examples off the top of my head, but it's all over

unpleasant Bill Ferny was, how mysterious Strider was, and how scary the Nazgul

Until they fix the DRM retardesness I'll just enjoy my much-easier-to-get

anti-piracy shit that makes the "legal" copy inferior the more $ they're
costing themselves.

But yeah, as I read it, Egregious
is wrong... the reverse engineering exception is only that you can circumvent
protection to figure out how to make YOUR OWN independent works operate on a
device.  That is you could reverse engineer a way to load your own (not others
copyright-held) works onto a kindle for example.... you can't just strip DRM
off other peoples works, legally, to use them elsewhere.

Here's the full text of it:

(f) Reverse Engineering..


(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a)(1)(A), a person who has
lawfully obtained the right to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent
a technological measure that effectively controls access to a particular
portion of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing those
elements of the program that are necessary to achieve interoperability of an
independently created computer program with other programs, and that have not
previously been readily available to the person engaging in the circumvention,
to the extent any such acts of identification and analysis do not constitute
infringement under this title.




*** This part means you can get around protective measures ONLY to figure out
how to make "independently created computer programs" compatible other
programs.


Next bit:

(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a)(2) and (b), a person may
develop and employ technological means to circumvent a technological measure,
or to circumvent protection afforded by a technological measure, in order to
enable the identification and analysis under paragraph (1), or for the purpose
of enabling interoperability of an independently created computer program with
other programs, if such means are necessary to achieve such interoperability,
to the extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title.



Again, this is only applicable for use with "independently created" programs...
not DRM-stripped copies of commercially protected stuff.

Nex tbit-



(3) The information acquired through the acts permitted under paragraph (1),
and the means permitted under paragraph (2), may be made available to others if
the person referred to in paragraph (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides
such information or means solely for the purpose of enabling interoperability
of an independently created computer program with other programs, and to the
extent that doing so does not constitute infringement under this title or
violate applicable law other than this section.



Again this makes it clear the exceptions are NOT for purposes of circumventing
copyright


Last bit-


(4) For purposes of this subsection, the term .interoperability. means the
ability of computer programs to exchange information, and of such programs
mutually to use the information which has been exchanged.



Just a lanugage clarification here- still nothing that lets you strip DRM from
copywritten stuff developed by other people.

It depends on the type of DRM. The ones that require you to register your
account to a particular computer (Sony) have to have the DRM removed from said
computer. But once the DRM is gone, you can take it wherever. It is terribly
shortsighted. It encourages piracy. The best way to encourage people to
actually pay is to make it cheap and convenient, so it's easier to pay. I
actually went looking for a paid version of a book that was legally free on
Gutenburg the other day because I wanted the Kindle feature of syncing between
devices. THAT'S the way to do it.

You could get all the Tarzan books, and the John Carter Mars stuff. Also
there's a good chunk of H. P. Lovecraft in the public domain now, if you're
into that sort of thing, if you're not and want to check him out, "The Colour
out of Space" is the story people seem to think is one of his best, I like
"Polaris", then there's the obvious ones, "The Call of Cthulhu", "The Dunwich
Horror", "The Shadow out of Time", Etc. That implies that he did a lot of
horror, but it's not like gore and stuff, and he also did a lot of fantasy
stuff.

One of his big things, and I think he was the one who really did this well, is
starting some place pretty ordinary, and gradually building up details, letting
you know something's going on. As somebody put it, Lovecraft isn't the kind of
horror author that's going to gross you out or startle you or frighten you.
It's only when you start to think about just what kind of universe he's
constructed that it gets creepy. If you want a concentrated idea of that, "From
Beyond" is a pretty short one that gets at that, though I wouldn't say it's one
of his best. The other big thing he brought to horror/fantasy is what he calls
a sense of the cosmic. We're in a great big universe that doesn't give a shit
about us, basically, and he drew on the then new quantum mechanics and
relativity to show you jsut what kind of weird shit could go down in that
universe that didn't care one wit about us.

Oh yeah, and if you like SF and such, I don't know if any of it's free, but
look for Henry Kuttner and his many pseudonyms, look him up on Wikipedia. He
does some really awesome stuff that's pretty hard to classify, and he's not
nearly as well-known as he should be. I'll do some digging online to see if
there are any stories of his around.

When he's sitting there, essentially belittling Card's writing style?  I'm
sorry -- you can disagree with an author, and I'm good with that.  If they're
known for writing tripe, I guess the odd put-down might be deserved.  But if
you're going to take someone who's probabloy considered one of the top 40 or 50
science fiction writers, and put down their writing, you'd better have a good
reason for it.

Case in point:
"The premise of the story - that children will fight future battles - seems
plausible until you give it a moment's thought. I could buy it as satire,
perhaps, but as with everything else in the book, it's played in deadly
earnest, and comes across as very silly. (The side-plot of Ender's teenage
siblings taking over the world is sillier still.) But Card can morally absolve
himself on this note: the silliness is clearly unintentional. In fact, I can't
recall a note of humour, wit or playful irony in the whole novel. It's one of
the most poker-arsed things I've ever read."

Or, if I may paraphrase: If Card realized what he was writing, this would be
morally reprehensible, but he's so bad at writing that he doesn't even realize
that.

In reality, our high-minded reviewer is missing out the on the whole damn point
that Card was trying to make (IMHO).  But who cares?  Let's put Card down,
regardless.

*nods*  Rather.  And while I've been a critic of Card myself, in a sense - I'm
as likely to refer to him as "Mormon Scott Card" as I am "Orson", and it's a
criticism I'm far from alone in - there's no mistaking the quality of his
writing.  I mean... there are the two big awards in sf, the Nebula (voted on by
fans) and the Hugo (voted by fellow writers).  Card was the first writer ever
to win both of them the same year.  He did it for - gee, fancy that - Ender's
Game, which just happened to be his _first published novel_!  And then, he
turned arund and did it again the next year, for the follow up.
You don't do that if you're a bad writer.  Not only that, but the other Hugo
the man has won?  It's for a writing instruction book.

And then, add to that the fact that a book with similar themes - teens fighting
battles, being the linchpins for a revolution, etc - is getting a lot of
respect and attention right now, in Suzanne Collins' _The HUnger Games_, and is
being taken perfectly seriosuly and credibly.

So... yeah.  Somebody get that reviewer an enema, because they're full of it

I've read it - all three books in fact (Catching Fire and Mockingjay are the
rest of the trilogy).  My daughter is a huge fan, and an admin on a huge
internet Hunger Games based RPG board.  It's a relatively quick read... in
fact, I daresay if you got hold of a copy today, and were diligent enough, you
could do it in time for an opening day evening show tomorrow, or at worst a
weekend one.  It's not the quality of true classics, in the writing, and
obviously aimed at teens, but it's decent enough.  Collins' first series was
for younger kids, the preteen set, and this one suffers from that, as it's a
bit direct, very much un-nuanced and lacking in subtlety, which she's going to
need to develop (imo) if she's going to write for older audiences consistently.
But it's well enough done, and certainly engaging enough.  Some very direct,
almost accusatory, points to socio-political stuff in the here-and-now, reading
between some very obviously sketched lines, which is why i say un-subtle.
I love Rue, though.  Just like I'm supposed to, I know :)

developed the relationship with Rue a little more -- as it was, I felt like I
was *supposed* to care for her... but hadn't quite crossed the line.  I also
thought [SEMI SPOILER] she avoided some of the more difficult situations that
would be inherent in such a scenario; at the least, they could have been
visited by means of memories of previous years' Games.

I think you're right, in the sense that she _didn't_ go the extra mile; I'm not
sure if it's that she wasn't willing, so much as it was she might not have been
sure how.  Consider that Hunger Games was her first teen book, and she'd only
done one other series before that, a four (I think) book set aimed at the
preteen set, but which, much like Harry Potter, started out much less sinister
and dark than it ended up.  So Collins is a pretty new writer, perhaps moreso
than most realize, and I wonder if some of the flaws in Hunger Games are a
result of that.
That said, I'm not disagreeing - there's a lot more she could have done, even
given that she was aiming for teens (and I got the impression younger teens at
that), not adults.
As for the King *heh* he drives me nuts.  The original version of _The Stand_
was the only thing of his I could even say I somewhat liked, so at a certain
point I gave up on him.  So I can't comment to that.  (And yes, for those that
will say "Oh, read the Dark Tower"... did that.  The first two and a half,
anyway.  And any of several others suggested as his "best."  I'm a writer who
really doesn't like his _On Writing_, too... how much because by the point I
read it, I was anti-King so it's a mental thing, I couldn't say.  But at least
I'm consistent *heh*)

Interesting.  Well... with King, I guess I'm tempted to agree to an extent.
But he's a bit of a complex writer.  There are, as far as I can tell, four
different phases of his:
- Stock horror genre; this was probably true up to '90 or so.
- Novellae/short stories
- Newer stuff (post-first-book Dark Tower, all the psychological ones)
- Alter-ego Richard Bachman stuff

I largely enjoyed his horror stuff -- Firestarter, The Dead Zone, Salem's Lot
were all good books, and so on.
Novellae/short stories -- this is where I find he's at his most complex and
enjoyable, and probably where most of his movies come from: Shawshank
Redemption, The Body/Stand By Me, and (alas) decent stories with simply not
enough to make a movie, which didn't stop some from trying: Children of the
Corn, Maximum Overdrive.

The newer stuff, his more psychological stuff, I have very little use for.  I
guess he likes writing them, and they sell, so some folks are buying them, but
it ain't me.

The Richard Bachman stuff, though -- that's perhaps his most interesting.  Very
dark stuff, there.  _Running Man_ essentially shared the title with the movie
of the same name; the novella was impressively depressing.  The Long Walk was a
(errr) another variant on the whole gameshows-meet-dystopia angle; reminds me
of a short story I read back in high school where amusement parks were run by
the Department of Population Control.

So.  There are many books he's written that I've really enjoyed, but the huge
majority of them were written 20+ years ago.
And I wouldn't be surprised to see someone come along a bit later, and be
disappointed in the "current" King books on the shelves.

bothered, I have to admit, with the newest of his stuff - as in the past 10-15

style, because I've read horror books, psychological thrillers, literary stuff,

could write.  I wonder sometimes if it's easier to write a satisfactory ending
if you have an early climax because there's so much falling action to play
with.

Two examples come to mind - Hamlet and Lord of the Rings.  The climax of
Macbeth is arguably when Hamlet spares Claudius at the chapel.  There's two
more acts of falling action after that, during which a lot of interesting stuff
happens, and I think that's one of the reasons Hamlet is such a popular play.
Compare with, say, King Lear or Henry IV-2.

The climax of the Lord of the Rings triology ... well there's several,
arguably, but I'd say it's the point where Sam decides to wear the ring and
rescue Frodo from the tower at Cirith Ungol.  That point is when Sam must
decide whether he is a faithful companion driven forward through love of his
master, or a brave hero in his own right compelled to soldier forth in the
absence of leadership, to carry Frodo up the mountain when Frodo can't walk,
and to leave the mountain to escape the lava flows so the Eagles can find
them, etc.  If that doesn't happen, Sam never transforms into the person he
must be during the later chapters, and never becomes a whole, complete person
in his own right, such that Frodo can leave Middle Earth and Sam can go on to
have a happy life with his family.  The rest of the climactic action in LOTR is
narratively pre-ordained.

That happens pretty early in book 3, leaving a lot of chapters of falling
action as the characters basically trace their steps back to the beginning -
back to Gondor, back to Helm's Deep, back to Fangorn, back to Saruman, back to
Rivendale, back to Bree, and back to the Shire.  Tolkein can leisurely wrap up
the various loose ends, bit by bit, peeling off companions, giving them
individual denouments, and then eventually giving us just the hobbits, by
themselves, changed by the world and the better for it.

When your falling action and denoument consist of 25 pages, it's pretty tough
to satisfactorily wrap up the loose ends and know where to stop.  Stephen King
actually, I think, does a pretty good job of very quickly disposing of falling
action and denoument in most of his novels.

REAMDE is *the* Stephenson I couldn't finish.  Makes me sad.  His other books
always seem to be about... let's call them exceptional people in exceptional
circumstances.  And he does that so damn well!  Not so much with REAMDE.

And I admit, I'm amused: I liked the first Dark Tower the best, thought the
second was solid, and it kind of went downhill for me from there.  I stopped at
#4.

As for endings, yeah, I agree about Stephenson: damn good ideas, tough time

Dark Tower --

  I began reading these as they were published.  By far, WIzard & Glass was my
  favorite.  I felt it was the best written and provided the most complete and
  lovingly-sketched tapestry of characters.  The problem with W&G glass is
  that you have a story-within-a-story, and the interior story is actually
  way more interesting at that point than the exterior, and after the
  interior story is told, I didn't really care about the main plot that much
  any more.

  Wolves of the Calla was where I started to think King had lost his touch on
  the series.  It was an entertaining, servicable read, but it had begun to
  descend into onanism.  This came full circle with that 6th book.  At some
  point there too many references to other King books I hadn't read, and I
  felt like he was trying to goad me into buying them to understand it all.

  And it was completely unnecessary.  Mordred?  Pointless, useless character.
  Served no real purpose.  The Crimson King?  Also a pointless, useless
  character in the end, serving no real purpose.  The entire Dark Tower wound
  up having no real purpose.  I didn't mind the "circle back to the beginning"
  aspect nearly so much as the fact that the Tower was nothing, King couldn't
  even define a servicable metaphoric use for it.  It was a classic case of
  inventing too much on the spot for six books and then trying to wrap it all
  up in the seventh.

  Then I Went back to read my first edition of the Dark Tower, and you can
  very truly see King's evolution as a writer.  The early books are so
  choppy and sloppy in so many places.  His maturity as a writer is clear.

  But, while his writing improved, his stories haven't.  And to some extent,
  I felt he continued to rely too much on ... I don't know how to put it.

  There's a scene in Wizard and Glass where the fat sheriff is talking to
  his deputy, and the sheriff leans over and cuts a fart, and that scene
  defines the character so goddam well and just makes that scene, it tells
  you everything about the sheriff.

  Then there's a scene in the 7th book where some mutant-like human-oid
  creature is in a cave of some kind with Eddie and Susannah and the
  creature cuts a fart.  No purpose.  Not definitional.  Just a hack
  writer writing about farts.

What the hell's the point of Snow Crash, anyway? I don't mean the plot, but can
somebody tell me why the hell I should care? Everything I've read about it was
going on about computers and Sumerian gods. I started reading it and there was
something about a hyperkenetic pizza delivery dude crashing in somebody's
swimming pool or something. I was like, yeah, OK, whatever, moving on.

I'm not the biggest fan of books that start in media res, but I'm OK with them,
if they grab me. But I sort of had the same problem with SC that I had with the
whole Pern series. People were raving about them, so I'm like, cool, I'll check
'em out. There's some girl and blather about a watchwyrm and then some shit
happens to a bunch of nobility whom I don't know and thus don't care about, and
yeah, I gave up about halfway through the first book.

Nobody was really explained, so I was dropped into the middle of this
supposedly great intrigue and all, and I'm just thinking, "OK, but I have no
idea who any of these people are, or really what they're doing. Why the hell
should I care about them"? As a contrast, compare the Riddle Master series by
Patricia McKillip, if you've read it, apparently another YA thing, but I
thought they were pretty good, I stumbled across them a couple years ago.
Interesting ideas, pretty unique, decent characters, and even though it sort of
started in the middle, I could relate to them.

My biggest problem with Card is his deterministic universe.  Some

Hunger Games is pretty good.  It's not the most bestest thing ever,

The third book was definitely different.  It felt a little unfulfilled

When reading the whole Hunger Games series, I was struck by how the author used
and restructured some of the symbolism of To Kill a Mockingbird.  She even used
the same narrative convention of first person, although not as well as Lee did.


I got into a long discussion with my kid about the Mockingjay and Mockingbird
in these two books.  Lee tells us that "you can shoot all the jays you want,
but it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."  Mockingbirds bring only beauty into the
world through their songs.  In Hunger Games, the birds are blended and
restructured; the jay is the annoyance, the rebel. The Mockingbird is the
innocent sacrifice.  We thought it was a really interesting way to structure
the book.

I remember being taught in school about Poe's focus in writing. How each story
had a purpose - something it was suppose to invoke in the reader. And how he
made sure every line in the story contributed to that goal, and got rid of the
ones that didn't.

First of all, is that accurate? And if so, is that summed up in some quote or
paragraph or something?

What I'm looking for is some pithy, well-written explanation of that idea that
I can share with some people.

People Curious about disabilities> First let me say..I'm not sure if people
consider color blindness a disability...I mean no offence by it, I use the term
more in reference to myself for this post.

In Nov. of 2008 I suffered a random Spinal Cord issue (they think it may have
been a spinal stroke).  Essentially I woke up one morning with a pain in my
back, within 30 minutes I lost the use of my hands and other abilities were
fading fast, by that afternoon I was paralized from the the lower chest down,
including my hands and elbows.  I spent over 5 weeks in the
hospital...including nearly a month of that in an inpatient rehabillitation
hospital floor specilizing in spinal cord diseases and injuries. I was
constantly amazed at how ignorant, insensative, and often times rediculous some
people could be..including family, friends, and hospital staff (people who
worked w/ spinal cord patients everyday!).
Some of my "favorite" incidents included:

* Friends and family coming in shortly after the incident and showing me how
they pinch their fingers shut and asking if I could at least do that. "see like
this, just try"...as though suddenly at the age of 33 I simply forgot how my
hands worked, or lacked the desire to try to move them.
My reaction would be to just answer their question...as I understood that this
was new to them too, and it is hard for someone to wrap their minds around.  At
one point I told some of them to choose a spot between their wrist and elbow
and try to bend it...thats how it was for my hands etc no matter how hard you
try or want it to move it just doesn't.  Explaining it in a way they could
relate to sometimes seemed to help.

* Each morning at the hospital for spinal cord rehabillitation I'd have nurses
come in to give meds, help me get dressed, feed me, etc etc.  Most nurses got
tom know me pretty well, and they knew what my issues were, and they knew what
I struggled with most both physically and pschologically was the loss of the
use of my hands.  There was one nurse who thought she was funny (she wasn't)
but she was always trying to crack jokes.  One morning her partner asked how I
was feeling, and before I could answer the jokester said "Tell her.. I feel
with my hands silly".  All I could think was...if I could feel my hands I
wouldn't have two strangers dressing me as though I were an infant right then.
The other nurse just looked at me mortified, while the other one kept trying to
crack jokes..which I ignored because I knew she didn't mean any harm.

* While at the same hospital I had someone make a delivery to my room of
medical equipment.  He needed me to sign for it. I explained that my hands
were completely paralyzed and I couldn't hold a pen.  He kept telling me to
just try.  Back and forth we went for a good 5 minutes...finally he decided
he'd just put the pen in my hand...apparently this would cure my paralysis in
his mind.  When the pen fell from my hand he got annoyed and again told me I'd
have to try.  Finally a nurse over heard and came in and signed for me.
Afterwards I remeber crying and ranting about it all...wondering if next he'd
take someone in a wheel chair set them in front of some stairs and tell them
just to try.

 Eventually I calmed down...realising that people just can't wrap their minds
around somethings.  Over times I've realised that as people try to understand
things they had never considered before...they end up saying stupid things,
asking rediculous questions, try to ease discomfort by making dumb jokes, which
sometimes  turn out to be insensative.

The 3 best ways I've found to react include:
1. Ignore it.
2. Try to help them understand by explaining things from their point of view.
3. Let them know when you've had enough...for example these days as my recovery
has progressed I get lots of questions about "can you do this or that, squeeze
my hand, can you pick this up" etc... basically they want to see my new tricks,
new movements, new strengths etc so they give me little tests...when it gets to
be too much for me I half jokingly tell them something like
"I get enough of these tests at the doctors, if your looking for me to pay you
too for these tests your gonna be outa luck"
And they'll usually take the hint and back off.

Starlight Wishes, you give me reason to reconsider some of my own experiences.
In the two years after my own closed head injury,I often WISHED I had been
paralyzed or lost a limb so people would be able to SEE what was wrong with me.

People would be furious with me for forgetting dates, names, etc. or not
recognizing emotion on their face.  I had friends stop speaking to me because I
"insisted" on ignoring their "clear" expressions of discomfort -a nd called me
an asshole for explaining that I honestly /couldn't/ read facial expressions.
The whole "just try" or "just pay attention" rote was daily, and it took me a
LONG time to get over the pain of that.

I always assumed that a more obvious physical injury would give people a
reminder not to ignore the needs and abilities of the person to whom they were
speaking.  On many levels, I have seen how untrue that can be - but you related
experiences very similar to my own that made that real, thanks.

On another note - my favorite thoughtless idiot moment was how I broke my left
arm.  This was a month after my head injury.  I was incapable of standing
upright, and I didn't KNOW that. I didn't remember why I was in a hospital bed,
you see.  So they had me tied down to my bed, so I wouldn't get up.

Well, a nurse poked her head in one day to tell me it was just about time to
get ready for my bath!  And then she left the room.  I apparently took this to
mean I was supposed to get out of bed - and what the hell!  I'm tied down!  So
I diligently undid all my restraints, sat myself up, and attempted to wakl out
of bed.

SPLAT!  That nurse was working in a different wing before my mom came in to
spend the day with me.

RE: Visible Signs

Mama K is right, it would be a great help to have a visible, outward sign of my
colorblindness.  But it would still not always be a guarantee of respectful
treatment.

However, it my opinion, it would be enough for me.

Living with colorblindness, 95% of the time I can function on the same level as
everybody else in the "mainstream".  Traffic lights, computer software, etc. is
written specifically with us in mind.  And I carry a job where I can wear
blue-jeans to work, so matching my tie to my suit isn't an issue for me at this
stage in my career.

It's true that because of this, because of the lack of "special equipment", the
world at large doesn't know about my vision issues unless I tell them (and
usually I have to tell them because I need to ask for help.)  It's not the same
as a blind person with a white cane and dark glasses, or sometimes a dog on a
harness, that telegraphs to the rest of the world that they can't see.  Or a
paralyzed person using a wheelchair, who justifies the construction of the ramp
on that public building.  For me, it's not obvious to other people why I need
to ask for help sometimes, so it's very easy for them to overdo it on the
curiosity spectrum.

With my manager at my job, I eventually had to make a comparison between myself
and a coworker of mine, who was born with a tumor on her spine that prevents
her from walking at the same ability level as the rest of us.  I asked my
manager, would it be appropriate for me to go up to this coworker and ask her
to demonstrate, to show me how she walks?

Manager said, "no, that would be stupid and disrespectful.  Anybody who did
that would be terminated immediately" for what my company calls "negative
interaction".

My response, then:  how is that situation different from somebody coming up to
me and asking me to spot colors around me?  I'm still being asked to
demonstrate my lack of visual ability compared to most people.  How is that not
equally disrespectful?

No legitimate answer (yet), but no official company response on the normal
"what color is this?" treatment I always go through.

Feh.

People sometimes just forget that they're not the first person to ever think of
some particular joke.  I call it first response syndrome.

In order to develop a more sophisticated sense of humor, I think it's a good
idea to immediately ignore the first joke you think of and instead say the
second or third.  Chances are the first one is obvious and tired, if not to
you, then to the person who's hearing it.

When people make these idiotic jokes, they probably honestly think they're bein
clever.  They're going with their first response rather than taking a moment to
consider the fact that the joke's victim has heard that joke a thousand times
and it's way less fresh to that person than to the teller.

It's not a disability or anything, but it's the same manners issue:  my name is
Aprille, pronounced April.  You wouldn't *believe* how many people think
they're the first ones to come up with some dumb pun joke on April Fool's Day.

People are just stupid and lazy and can't be bothered to come up with fresh
jokes.  Sucks, but it's their personality defect, not yours.

I'm going to tip, I do it daily -- first of all, you might have different
housekeepers each day, and secondly, I find that a tip on the first day leads
to better service on the next day, etc (more towels, extra attention to detail,
maybe turn-down service...)  I think of it as incentive.  If you want to use it
purely as reward, then at the end is probably fine.

It depends on the hotel, but I usually leave money at the end of the trip.  If

I don't leave much, if it's just a regular hotel.  Like maybe $1 per day for tw

I leave a more under certain circumstances.  I left more when I was staying at
a Ritz-Carlton because the staff was super awesome and really took care of us.
I left more for the girl who cleaned the rooms at the inn we took over for our
wedding because we made a huge mess.  I actually left her a lot of money
because I knew how hard she worked to clean up after our group.  I leave a
little more when I'm traveling with kids - especially messy or sick kids.  If
your child pukes in the bathroom, grinds Cheerios into the carpet, wets the
bed, or has an attack of diarrhea and goes through 5 diapers in 2 hours, please
leave the cleaning staff extra money.  Or if you don't usually leave money,
leave them something.  They make jack.

I'm not sure how to go about figuring out whether or not I'm invited to a
wedding, but the invitation got lost in the mail.  My husband and I have been
invited to this couple's wedding shower, bachlor and bachelorette parties, I've
been invted to the bridal shower (separate from the wedding shower), and we've
received a formal invitation to their "floating reception", which is a 5 night
cruise to Cozemel.  We declined the cruise, but attended the wedding shower
last night.  We know that the actual wedding ceremony will be on July 31 in the
city.  They've mentioned it to us, as well as their friends and family at the
wedding shower last night.  We got a lot of "see you at the wedding" comments.
However, we don't really know where the wedding is, since we didn't get a
separate invitation to that - and the info wasn't in the invitation to the
cruise reception.
I'm confused, but I don't want to mention anything to the couple, since maybe
they are just invited family and really, really close friends to the wedding
ceremony, but everyone else gets invited to the cruise reception.  We don't
want to make them feel uncomfortable, but are wondering if they are waiting for
us to RSVP to a wedding they thought they invited us to.  Any way to tactfully
figure this out?  Or should we wait for them to ask us if we've RSVP'ed yet?

This might sound weird as an etiquette question, but here goes: I am
considering joining a gym that offers child care in the form of a large
playroom. I am considering joining because  they are offering the membership at
$14.95 per month and, as far as I know before I call to confirm, this should be
without enrollment fees or contracts or other hidden fees. I am also
considering joining the gym because although I have a Bowflex at home and was
considering buying a treadmill (for which we really don't have space), I
couldn't compete with the thought of being able to work out safely without my 3
kids underfoot and for that price! Is is wrong to want to join not only because
I would have access to a much better model treadmill and weights than I would
have at home, but mostly for the sanity of getting some time to myself without
kids (I never am without them otherwise).

Would it be wrong for me to expect them to provide care for 2 hours a few days
a week for a 2nd grader and two preschoolers for the low low price of $15/mo? I
just feel it doesn't seem fair, but it is one heckuva a deal and I really need

We have a mortgage broker who's also sort of a friend of the family. He's
very good at his job and has done a couple of loans for us.

Recently, he asked us if we were interested in doing a re-fi. Unfortunately,
I recently got laid off and my wife's income alone wasn't enough to qualify
us for the re-fi.

Just a few days ago, our bank called us with a "special offer for being such
a good customer" where we can get our rate dropped by a whole percentage
point. I talked to the guy on the phone and was up front with him that we
only had one income at the moment and he said it wasn't an issue.

The bank is Chase and everything seems legit; they sent the offer via Fed-Ex,
the guy on the phone was very professional, etc etc. I want to do the re-fi
and save ourselves a couple hundred bucks a month. My wife, on the other
hand, thinks that us doing the re-fi this way is a "betrayal" of our
friend/broker and we shouldn't do that. As a compromise, I sent our broker an
email telling him about the offer we got from the bank and if he would be
willing to look his numbers over again and/or contact the bank (if he could)
and broker Chase's special offer to us.

No response to the email in two days and this guy usually replies to emails
within the hour.

So, wife still thinks we should not save ourselves thousands of dollars over
the length of the loan because we can't do the loan through our broker. To
further compromise, I'm willing to call the broker tomorrow morning and ask,
"did you get that email I sent...?"

So sorry for the length of this, but to wrap it up, are we under any kind of
ethical obligation to NOT act in our own financial best interest, epecially
since within the last month the broker has already told us he can't do our
re-fi?

Ditto. Email isn't guaranteed communication. If you really want to give him a
opportunity to respond with a offer, make every effort to reach him today.
You've got a good offer in writing, he needs time to produce the same on his
end. (I'm assuming you did the math on the closing costs, there's no pre-
payment penalties, that sort of thing... If you're not confident in your review
of the Chase offer make sure you understand it, etc)



This isn't at you RJ... But in general... One of my biggest personal gripes is
how people use email... They think because they sent it, it always gets
through, when we all know just how unreliable email can be (or people can be on
vacations, or have an outage, or whatever).

My spam filter for the longest time was blocking any email with the letters
"BJ" in it, when I finally figured out the problem and got all the emails
released I was shocked at the stupidity in some of the emails. People begging
me to call them, threatening me to call them, all in email... The sickest
thing, is every one of them has my personal cell # and office # to reach me
anytime.

If you don't hear back when you expect to hear back, pick up a phone !

Well, etiquette books say 1 year because people get 1 year to send you a gift.
So the folks who sent you a gift 9 months after your wedding get a thank you
card 10 months after your wedding.  I think that's the logic there.
I sent thank yous pretty much within a week of receiving the gift.  I did that
because I knew I'd forget if I didn't send them right away.  Thank you cards
are pretty cheap to buy at Target - I just picked up a box of 10 for $2.99
yesterday.  However, you could also just get some paper and make thank you
cards.  If you think you'll be able to afford thank you cards in, say, a month
or so - then just wait and buy them then.  Otherwise, maybe think about making
them, asking friends/family if they have spare cards, or maybe calling people
to thank them.

How is mine a trollish interpretation?  Sure, it's a social give-and-take, I
realize that.  If you want gifts in the future, don't piss off the gift-givers
by not thanking them for the last thing they sent you.  But I bristle at the
implication that you're GOING to get a gift in the future because you sent a
thank you note in the past.  No gift-giver is EVER obligated to pony up, even
if they receive a personalized solid gold engraved thank you note studded with
diamonds with a platinum overlay.

So if you ask friends for stamps do you have to send a thank you note for those
too? ;P

I say send them when you can.,..these days more people than not don't send
thank you notes at all...sad but true.
My brother and sister in law for example never sent them for their wedding
(which we spent a mint on since we had to have 3 kids participate in the
wedding plus gift.  Same year they had a kid...MIL had guests address their own
thank you notes at the shower...still no note...christening gifts, birthday
, welcome to the world gifts...all unaknowledged....eh what are you gonna do.
*shrugs*
I'd say more than half the weddings I've been to didn't send any thank you
notes.

My point being...I'd say send them out as soon as you can without going
hungry....even if it is a few weeks/months late something sent at all will put
you ahead of at least half the people I know.

My grandmother-in-law is a big one on "its never too late to send a thank you
note"   I think she is still holding out hope that my sister and

Its not that I expect amazing gratitude of a gift... But if you ask me to leave
an envelope full o' cash in a basket, you should acknowledge receipt. How does
anyone know when envelopes are stolen at weddings? My bff had over a dozen
envelopes stolen at her wedding several years ago... She found out 2 months
later because she got her thank-you notes out on time and noticed no gifts
from a few people (and she knew at least a couple of them were the type to
do the simple cash in a envelope, like me).

Turned out it was around $2k lost in total. She put together letters from
the gifters and submitted a claim to her homeowners insurance, insurance
asked her to make a police report too, and she got her $ back.

She would've had no idea about the missing gifts unless these people asked her
if she rec'd them... Maybe some would ask, maybe some wouldn't ask, who knows
when they'd ask, one at a time... Probably would take a year to figure it out.
(IF you could've figured it out at all) Many people don't ask about
unacknowledged gifts.

Speaking as someone who makes and gives afghans as gifts, I would probably not
ask about the quilt.  When I plan to make and give someone a baby blanket or
whatever, I don't tell them about it in advance.  However long you think it's
going to take you to make the blanket, it always takes at least twice as long,
and half the time you end up ripping it apart and starting over.  Knowing that
someone is "waiting" on the gift (for me) can really increase the guilt factor
to the point that I don't even feel like working on the damn thing anymore.

Also, if you're one of those super-creative but also scatter-brained people (my
mom is like this), a lot of times you get so excited about a project at the
beginning, but then you lose your enthusiasm or pick up a different project in
the middle of the first one and forget about the first one.

Bottom line, don't ask.  She'll fork it over if and when she gets it done.

not my partner, but the invitation itself was preprinted and didn't say my name
anywhere on it, and the envelope was addressed to "Pat Dunn" instead of "Dr.
Patrick Dunn," so I'm thinking that correct etiquette is not necessarily a

Okay, you're both right....  Odds are these days that people haven't a clue
what they're supposed to do -- forget proper etiquette, I'm just talking common
sense rules of the game.  In many circles, of COURSE they mean you should bring
a date! (Or so they'll say when you ask).  But realistically, the names on the
invitation are the people who are invited.  No more, no less.  The conservative
answer is don't bring a date.  The realistic answer is, ask.  The absolutely
wrong answer is to bring a date without checking first.  But I've been to
plenty of weddings where guests assumed it was okay to bring the ENTIRE family
(extended family, mind you), if just the couple were invited, and believe me,
if causes nothing but mass pandemonium as the bride finally gets wind of this
plan the week before the wedding and tried to figure out how to accomodate 8
more people for the reception, never mind that she doesn't even KNOW some of
these extended relatives and doesn't want them there...  But I digress.

I have been invited to the reception only for weddings held small churchs..

IF the invite doesn't assume a guest, you can offer to pay for the extra seat,
or offer to wait on the noshow list.. (typically some people who rsvp'd
don't show up, and it still costs money for those plates.but you have to know
you might not get dinner there.) Or offer to skip dinner ie eat somewhere
else then show up late..

nowdays.
This also goes for trying on clothes in a store and handing them the tags for
the items you have put on.  This is a no-no.  If you wish to leave with the
clothes on, purchase them, then go to the bathroom to change your clothes after
you have purchase them.

I understand where you are coming from with the entire, I'm going to pay for it

of the purchase.  Otherwise people might be thinking you are stealing.

If it is a little local store that I am friends with the owner or something

It's something I've done, and seen people do, for all the years they've had

anywone even -question- if it was ok or not.

In the RCC you are not supposed to eat or drink for one hour prior to
communion... which would clearly rule out during mass.  This was a reduction by
Vatican II from a 3-hour fast required prior to communion (Communion, not
mass).  The RCC actually required fasting from Midnight the night before mass
until Pope Pius XII reduced it to 3 hours in the 1950's.

So in the RCC, it is not just innapropriate to eat or drink during mass, but
against Canon law for 1 hour prior to Communion, unless you are sick or require
medication.

service with coffee mugs.  They have coffee and snack after service and before
Sunday School which I think is the more appropriate time.

As for drinking in a store.  It is different than a restaurant. You go to the

A number of grocery stores have hot bars and areas to sit/eat now....

And a number of restaurants are take-out only....

But probably more significant is even the folks who run the grocery stores see
nothing wrong with opening a drink you're going to pay for in the store....

So, my 4 year old has been invited to his first Chucky Cheese party (gag).  On
the invitation (supplied by CC), there were several check boxes under the event
info.  "Food will be served for all", "Food will be served for kids only", and
"No food will be served."  They checked the box next to "kids only".  Now, is
it just me, or is that pretty rude?  I mean, it's a bunch of 4 and 5 year olds.
I'm not going to drop my kid off there with a family I don't know (my son's BFF
from preschool, but I've only seen the parents in passing).  It's during the
lunch hour (11-1pm).  Again, I'm new this whole kids' party thing, but if I'm
inviting kids, I'm assuming their parents are coming, and I'd feel obligated to
include them in the party (i.e. feeding them).  Am I expecting too much here? 
(Yes, I know the food is crap, but it's not like CC's is going to let me bring
in outside food, either.)  Seems rude to me, but I'm one of those people who's

my problem with the prequels is that they were so radically misconceived,
tiredly written, and then so hamhandedly executed by a lazy director way, way
behind the curve on technology rather than ahead of the curve like the
original trilogy.  once the initial star wars glow wore off them, it really
did wear off and we were left with so little to savor beyond a few moments in
the third film.

still, new revelations come out about how shitty they are.  the latest thing
i remember is a complete breakdown of one of episode I's redeeming features,
the epic lightsaber battle at the end.  yep, nearly every single swing of a
saber in the fight was purely for show, and undefended never would have even
grazed its intended target.  a wuxia demonstration rather than a fight, then.

we've already seen what a sleepy hack trying to recapture the glory of the
originals looks like.  disney and lucasfilm have a chance to get young,
hungry, talented people all over this, draft some amazing screenplays, and
shoot the shit out them.  and not all in front of a green screen either, with
some real sets and locations.  give us characters we can love, dialogue we
can quote instead of BUT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW YOU'RE EVIL!  I HATE SAND!,
and endless wailing about prophecies nobody ever figures out.  and tax
arguments.  make the stakes high, make them about evil motherfuckers who will
kill your people and destroy your planet for looking at you wrong.

and while i hope for an old republic trilogy down the road, i'm at peace with
an episode VII.  hell, i'm almost wishing there was a role for a ben kenobi-
aged luke skywalker to come in and bridge the gap, though no carrie fisher or
harrison ford please.

and NO FUCKING EMPEROR CLONES.

there should be a law on a plaque on every sci-fi writer's wall: when you
start cloning characters who were killed off, stop writing because you
already fucked it up.  (lone exception: duncan idaho in the dune novels, who
existed almost as a pre-rebuke to those who would try to resurrect a
character and hope for the same magic to return)

the whole war was over nute gungray trying to import cheap toasters into
naboo without paying tariffs.

the clone wars series does veer closer to personal stories and more individual
bad guys, at least.  i've seen some good episodes, but only one had to do with
a bunch of dudes who all look the same under the mask, "rookies," just because

Was the Droids vs. Drones "who cares" part of the point?  Part of what the
Emporer did to gain power was drum up a massive war between two otherwise
unwilling parties, and part of how he did that was to make them feel that by
fighting it they actually had little to risk, but if they didn't fight it they
lost everything.

Convincing the Republic to fund and execute an army of clones to go fight a
threat is a lot easier than covincing them to actually send off their own
children to do so.  The same with the trade federation, only swap "clones" for
"droids."

Wreck-It Ralph> My Review:


Full thing here:  http://worthplaying.com/article/2012/11/2/reviews/87431/


Excerpts:

"In one of the trailers for "Wreck-It Ralph," Zangief (Street Fighter) tells
the main character, "You are bad guy, but this does not mean you are bad guy."
It's a small, but important, distinction that helps define the main character.
A similar thought applies to the film as a whole. "Wreck-It Ralph" may be a
movie about video games, but it is not a video game movie. It's something much
better."



"Though the goal may seem straightforward, Ralph's adventure is far from it.
Before the end of the film, he'll end up endangering the entire arcade, making
a friend, saving the princess and learning what it really means to be a hero.
These are all common themes in a Disney film. What makes "Wreck-It Ralph" stand
out is the seamless way in which everything comes together. Even though the
story hits all of the required checkboxes, it never feels forced or rushed. The
emotions conveyed are real, and the film's climax is guaranteed to soften even
the hardest of hearts."


"Whether you're a classic video game fan or just someone looking for a fun time
at the movies, "Wreck-It Ralph" delivers on all counts. On par with some of
Pixar's best, "Wreck-It Ralph" is destined to be a Disney classic that appeals
to kids (and gamers) of all ages. It's not to be missed."

The prequel trilogy made a point of focusing more on the Emperor's meddling of
galactic politics in the Republic to take over the whole thing. Seen from that
point of view, it is interesting. But the first movie looks stupid even
removing Jar-Jar because well... it's a war started over stupid reasons, like
FCT said. And even stupider how the army actually gets defeated ... you'd
wonder why the Republican Army isn't simply shooting down the control ships in
Eps 2 and 3 instead of wasting time with the droids!

At least Eps 2 and 3 had a bit more "drama" and a better reasoning on the war
than just "commercial blockade".

if drumming up a war of flesh and blood for dubious reasons was within dick
cheney and george w. bush's power, it should have been within palpatine's.

lucas in fact specifically said he was thinking of numerous chapters in history
where democracies were perverted into dictatorships over the manufacturing of
war and an enemy from which the dictator shall protect the people.  so nothing
in the story demands clones and droids, because it's a story about human
civilization.  now a story about humans banding together to fight a droid
menace, great (the gungan army in TPM is actually a step in the right
direction).  people banding together to fight a faceless clone army, great
story.  people who have to use a clone army to fight a droid army, eh.

of course, the clone army did make the order 66 sequence possible with the
resulting placement of the army within the emperor's hands, so it could have
been a more acceptable trade-off had we better protagonsists to focus on. 
sadly, so much of the drama is rendered inert by the wooden acting and
direction of anakin skywalker, the backbone of the trilogy turned into a
sulking dullard brat who ends up diminishing darth vader rather than enhancing
him, as the prequels ultimately should have.

movie at the theater, during its 1986 showing.)

Finally, I know why. The VHS tape I have is in Spanish ... because the movie
*was* released in Latin America. Dang, I always complained about not having the
tape in English, little did I know that I wouldn't even have the movie if I had
insisted in getting the english version.

Song of the South was released on home video in Japan and Europe as well.

The Japanese NTSC laserdisc is the most common source of bootleg recordings in
the US as it has the entire English audio track available with Japanese
subtitles only appearing during the songs (they're hard burned into the image).

There was a limited run of the movie released in Hong Kong on Laserdisc, that
is entirely in English with no subtitles. This is the most expensive version
availale.

European PAL VHS tapes were widely released, but the PAL conversion results in
a sound/time distortion (not to mention lower VHS quality) so it isn't an ideal
version to track down.

Song of the South was released in theaters, but has NEVER been officially
released on home video in the US.

It's the best Bond movie ever.  Javier Bardem was incredible.  They need to
hire him to be the villian for the next Bond film.  They should make the
villian Chigurh from No Country for Old Men.  That opening shot from the
elevator while Bond is seated is by far the best entrance of any Bond Villian.
The entire movie was the perfect antithesis of Quantum.  A real plot, that made
sense, that built up a real conflict, with real character development for all
parties involved.  Action scenes that actually advanced plot, and a *GASP* real
chase scene on foot that was realistic.  And planning!  My God, the planning! 
When 10+ henchmen died, they did so with forethought and strategy!  I didn't
have any complaints at all; I thought Ralph Fiennes was going to be an
afterthought.  But I was really glad to see that he was a really awesome
character later.

I am  not a James Bond geek, but it seemed apparent to me that there was a lot

When it was over, I got the sense that Daniel Craig had done his trilogy and
he's done. Now they might go another direction. But They seemed to put a lot

i see some people trotting out platitudes about "embracing the future" and
"people took awhile to adjust to color" but i don't find it the least bit
convincing.  higher frame rates are not the future, we're not finally catching
up to the BBC and daytime soaps.  they've always been a choice.

vs. the platitudes are very specific complaints about what 48fps does, and the
charge is crystal clear:  would you like to see the lord of the rings shot like
the "making of" segments in the special features?

24fps has for nearly all of cinematic history made ordinary moments seem grand,
poetic, and steeped in gravitas.  they give life its due weight.  it is not
represented exactly as our eyes see it, it is depicted as our imaginations
render it.  it is not a limitation, it is an enhancement.

i'm truly worried about peter jackson nowadays.  lord knows what a monster i'd
become with the kind of adulation he has received, but king kong revealed he
was learning some of the wrong lessons from his LOTR success.  yes, we reveled
in extended editions of the trilogy, but extending one book into a trilogy? 
i want to reserve judgment until i've watched all three, but when reviewers cry
"tedium!" i get nervous.

and everything i've read about 48fps, and based on what i know of the direct
comparisons made about it, (okay, my grammar is getting mangled here, but
i have no client at the moment)...i see hubris at work.  fatal hubris.  and the
review scores are reflecting it.

i've heard some speculate that with the right kind of technology, we'll get a
sense of balance with frame rates...that they'll speed up for big sweeping
vistas and then slow down for intimate moments.  perhaps jackson is martyring
himself for the greater good.  but right now it's a bold experiment that is not
working.  i will be trying my best to experience this movie first in 24fps, as
this is what defines the form of cinema.

I just want the best of both worlds, I guess.  I love the escapism of cinema,
but seeing motion blur during battle scenes just pulls me out of the film.  If
the downfall of 48fps is that the sets and effects look too fake, then
hopefully that will get Weta to really step up their game in the future.

I am all for continuing to move forward toward immersive holographic
projection.  I don't miss 35mm film grain.  It is entirely possible that I will
be disappointed with the HFR this weekend, and that 24fps will continue to be
the "sweet spot" for modern cinema.  That said, I can't believe it is 2012
already and the experiments with cinema are only so far along.  The current 3D
technology gives me eye strain after about an hour, so I am hoping the 48fps
will help aleviate some of that.

Pacific Rim - What it is about>

The basic plotline, as I understand it, goes like this. A portal to a dimension
filled with giant godzilla like monsters opens somewhere in the pacific. One
giant monster leaks through and takes out part of san fransisco before being
killed by fighter jets. The body is investigated and we learn where it came
from. More start leaking in and prove very hard to take down with traditional
infantry. A global project spawns where several countries (USA, Russian, China,
Japan, France, etc.) each build a giant robot to fight the monsters. Each robot
must be piloted by two pilots because of the special pilot interface someone
builds. The movie seems to be about the pilots that volunteer for this program
and their interactions as much as its about fighting giant monsters with giant
robots.

Metawise, its basically "can we come up with a realistic framework to explain
the conceit we want to put on the screen - giant robots fighting giant monster"
because the movie creators have a particular love for the Kaiju style japanese
movies of thirty years ago featuring giant robots nonsensically fighting giant
monsters but don't think the global (american) audience would accept a
blockbuster without a framework that can pass suspension of disbelief.

It looks good so far.

Here is an interesting quote from Joe Letteri (VFX lead on LOTR/The Hobbit)
from the site that WORF posted earlier:

CS: Whats the general reaction to 48 frames per second among the FX people you
work with? Does that seem to be something that will continue into the future
and does it help enhance the FX and 3D of it?

Letteri: Well, it solves one problem in 3D, which is motion blur. If you tend
to be prone towards motion sickness when you see something really blurry in 3D,
this really alleviates that problem, but it does change the look of the film
because everything looks hyper-real. Yeah, as Peter mentioned, and Im hearing
the same thing too from the few screenings Ive been to, when you talk to
people, the more familiar you are with film and the more nostalgic you are for
film, the harder it is to let go, and after a while, you cant let go, and you
take it for what it is. Anyone who I talked to who is younger who is used to
seeing film in any number of different ways says its like really not even
noticeable, not really a big deal.

watching non-HD stuff on a cheap HD LCD, but I noticed same thing with a couple
of HD movies we watched as well.  If higher FPS is moving that direction, I
really don't have much interest.

I do want to see The Hobbit but really don't want to deal with the crowds this
weekend.  My brother had invited me to the midnight showing but I'm sure there
was crowds, waiting in line, etc. and I just don't have patience for that
anymore.  I'll probably just hold off until next week to see it.

BTW, I managed to pick up all three LOTR movies from Walmart on Black Friday
for $2 each.  SCORE.

The Hobbit HFR 3D>

Technical review: I saw this in an IMAX theater.  It took me about 5-10 minutes
to get used to the higher frame rate.  The opening scenes of older Bilbo looked
"sped up", as if he was moving his arms too fast or walking too quickly.  Once
the prologue started though... oh my.  The big exterior shots of Dale and
Erebor were spectacular, but what really got me was the first big battle scene.
I have never seen such clarity in a chaotic battle scene before.  I am always
bothered by motion blur during battle scenes (think prologue for FoTR), and I'm
pretty sure my mouth was hanging open for the entire Battle of Azanulbizar. 
After that, I did not notice the sped-up effect much at all, as it felt like my
eyes had adjusted and my brain stopped going "wtf?".

As far as straight up 3D effects, this film felt different.  I didn't get any
dim strobing effects or things sticking out so far they felt cheezy.  It just
felt like everything had incredible depth.  I should also note that after
watching the entire film (almost three hours), I had no eye strain, which I
usually have after any 3D viewing.  Regarding complaints about the film looking
like a documentary, I do understand those because it does look very different
from 24fps film.  That said, it didn't bother me as much as it seems to bother
others.  My eyes were pretty busy checking out all the detail.  For example, I
could see the fabric texture in Gandalf's hat including the angle and depth of
the brim.  This is pretty fucking nuts, yes?  It just didn't bother me, it
pulled me in even more.  I guess I don't need my film to feel like a dream
sequence.

One other note on this.  I'm 36, and I've been to a lot of projected films over
my lifetime.  That said, I also play a lot of video games and I prefer a higher
frame rate/refresh rate/60hz, etc.  I have also been an early HDTV convert
going on 10+ years now.  Does this influence my opinion?  Possibly.  I also
asked the 9 year-old girl who went with me what she thought of the film and if
it "looked funny at all".  She replied, "The 3D looked awesome".

I had mixed feelings about it.  The detail WAS amazing, and in outdoor scenes
and battle scenes it looked incredible.  In close up scenes or more "every day"
scenes  it felt more like I had front row seats at a stage play.  The added
detail made things look fake that otherwise wouldn't.  What I found myself
actually wanting was a film that was 24fps in most scenes, but could switch to
48 fps for larger scenes with lots of action of sweeping landscapes.

Overall, though, I thought it was a positive effect.  I DID think the film
itself had some serious flaws and needed to be edited down drastically.  It was
entirely too slow at parts and seemed to be going nowhere fast.

So I guess it was a perfect adaptation of Tolkein
's writings. :-)

Good movie, intense with some humor scattered in. Reminded me a lot of
Inglorious Bastards with its bloody violence (as opposed to earlier Tarantino
films where the violence is very quick and/or only implied) and slow pace.

I loved Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio in their respective roles. The
film is about 2:45 long, and only started to feel "long" to me towards the end
when Jamie Foxx spends about half an hour killing everyone.

One thing that should not bother me but did.  At the very beginning the time is
set as "1858, two years before the Civil War". Didn't the Civil War begin in
1861?

Hobbit> Saw it, 3D HFR...

HFR> Didn't bother me at all, but it was also my first 3D movie I've seen, so
I'm not sure if what I was seeing was all that different from no HFR 3D.  I
think the 3D worked really well except for a few moments that reminded me of
the trombone scene in Creature From The Black Lagoon in 3D.  Did seem more
artificial than the LOTR scenery and sets, but I've heard people who saw the 2D
standard frame rate version have the same complaint.

Content> Do I need spoiler space?  oh well...


















 It was good, but not great.  I think if he kept to the book, made it a single
3-hour movie or 2 90-minute films it would have been better.  It did seem to
drag a little at times.  My wife thinks she heard me snore briefly, and we saw
it mid-afternoon, I wasn't tired.

I tried to comprehend the need to stray from the book so much, other than to
stretch a nice story (and a short 250-page read at that) into a forced epic
trilogy.  One thing my wife commented on after the movie was how Gandalf was
always yelling "Run!" or "Quickly!".  I wish someone had given those same
instructions to Jackson.

Why make Bilbo the artificial savior who fools the trolls into wasting time?
Bilbo wasn't that clever or brave that early in the book.  He evolved into a
reluctant "hero."

Why the pursuit and running *into* the caverns?  Wasn't it good enough to have
them taken captive in the storm?  All the Azog storyline addition seemed to do
was add more chase time to the film.  Once the Goblin King is dead there's
motivation for the Golbin/Orc pursuit.

So far it seems that the dwarves all lack personality.  In the book they
actually developed character, especially Bombur and Dwalin.  I also don't think
Thorin was a big of a douche in the book, at least not until he fell under the
gold lust.

Saruman seems like kind of a jerk in this film (of course he's not in the book)
which seems unnecessary unless Jackson's trying to convey that Saruman is
already succumbing to Sauron... but it seems kind of early for that to me since
supposedly the Hobbit takes place at the same time Saruman is driving Sauron
out of Dol Guldur.

Probably being nitpicky, but the LOTR trilogy set such a high bar, it's hard to
expect anything of lesser quality.  I've read in some forums online people say
that this seems like a corporate flick, while LOTR was more like an indie film.
Of course, I'll be back to see part 2, just because it's still one of the best
stories ever told.  Jackson hasn't managed to undo the story, just warped it a
little.

The Hobbit storyline>

















Tom, I think you are going to find the usual defenses for the expansion of
Bilbo's character and the addition of the Azog storline/chasee -- character
development and arcs.  Even though I wasn't thrilled with the Azog bit (why not
just stick to the book and use Bolg?), I do understand the writers wanting to
give Bilbo at least a small arc for the first movie.  They still have to cater
to people who have not read the book *or* seen any LoTR fils (surely such
people exist?).  I am on the fence about the Trolls, as I enjoyed Gandalf
getting a moment to shine there in the books, but I do understand wanting to
give Bilbo the screentime and growth (quick growth, yes).  I felt the end bit
with Bilbo and Thorin was cheezy, but again, I understand why they did it.  At
the end of the day, the hardcore Tolkien nerds such as myself are the niche
audience.

As for the padding into three films, I am still on the fence about that too.  I
do appreciate the backstory from the LoTR appendices being added, and I think
Jackson would face criticism if he did not have tie-ins or nods to the LoTR
(both story and films).  While I think a completely stand-alone Hobbit film or
two would do well enough on its own, I think it would have been a missed
opportunity to not go for the whole White Council/Dol Guldur storyline.  I am
very interested to see where that is headed for film two, and I am hoping we
get a full-blown White Council assault on Dol Guldur.  To me, that makes the
entire inclusion worthwhile and justification for padding this into a trilogy.

I have to say I'm torn on Radagast.  I do like the character, but could do
without the bird shit.  Then again, this is Peter Jackson.  I can't fault the
creator of Bad Taste for being himself.  I would still rather have him running
this show than Lucas/Spielberg/whatever.  After picking up steam, the film felt
like a fun rollercoaster ride and I hope the pace continues for the next film.

Joe learns from Seth (after Seth's experience with his own future self) that in
the future, someone called the Rainmaker has taken over all organized crime and
is closing all of the loops, killing off all of the loopers. We get the
impression that the Rainmaker is evil, and is powerful.  When Joe's future self
comes back to be terminated as well, he escapes and sets out to kill the
Rainmaker before he becomes the evil mob-boss-leader in the future. That'
s what leads both Joe and future-joe to Cid.  He grows up to become the
Rainmaker.  What Joe figures out that future-Joe doesn't is that the REASON the
Rainmaker is so evil, and also why he's intent on kill all of the loopers, is
what future-Joe does to him when he kills his mother while tryig to kill cid.
When Joe decides to "close the loop" before future-joe can kill Cid's mom, it
hopefully prevents cid from growing up to become what future-joe was so afraid
of.

So they were "
linked" in that Joe would grow up to become future-Joe, who ends up coming back
to inadvertently turn youg cid into the Rainmaker. In essence, future-Joe was
the emotional creator of the Rainmaker. Joe figures this out and prevents it
all by killing himself.

Hobbit 3D/DBOX>
Waited a little too long to go back and now the DBOX theater is showing Texas
Chainsaw Massacre.  I'm just not into slasher flicks, so guess I'm done with
DBOX for a while.  Not sure if I really want to see Hobbit 3D this weekend
(again, sort of) or just see Jack whatever.. the Tom Cruise movie.  I know..
I'm embarrassed for every bit of my MERP roots and all but The Hobbit just
didn't really grab me after they left the shire.  Maybe it gets more
interesting later on (after I left) but I think I watched about 2/3 of it
before walking out.  Jack Whassisface sounds like it could be a decent action
flick which sounds more appealing right now.

Saw this a couple of nights ago and really enjoyed it.  I won't ruin it for
anyone who hasn't had the chance to see it, but let's just say it has a lot
less to do with plane crashes than I expected and more to do with something
else.  Denzel Washington did a great job in his role and the movie flowed
nicely.

I enjoyed this quite a bit. When Joe was appearing to fall in love with Sara,
it was almost matching how old-Joe described how he fell in love with his
wife. I thought sure the movie was going to work young-Joe's confusion about
that, into the plot. but nope.

I never cought on that old-Joe effectively created teh rainmaker. I assumed
that some other badness created the rainmaker. (It was clear when Sara
hid herself inside of the gun safe that she knows Cid has this unctrollable
rage, so it doesn't stand to reason that old-Joe alone was the creation behind
the rainmaker.  But looking back, I see that is the intention, with Sara's
speech about how he can be good if he is raised well (in context of
transitioning to be his mother) .

The Bitch and the Airhead: Blatant Women-Bashing Makes a Gut-Wrenching
Comeback

Beast <http://thedailybeast.com> . Posted November 20, 2008

hange may well be coming to Washington. But the public discourse about
women has taken several steps backward.

Now that the election is over and racism is ostensibly down for the
count, has sexism gotten a new dispensation? Has the "unlikability" (not
to mention "unfuckability") of Hillary not only cost her the
presidential nomination but brought out the streak of misogyny that runs
deep in American culture, affecting the way men think about women and
the way women think about themselves?

And what about Sarah Palin, the breeding babe who has emerged as a
comely figure of fun with seemingly not a mote of self-doubt in her
constitution? Has she furthered men's natural instinct to write off
women as light entertainment, chattering nitwits with a shaky hold on
the hard facts, and also triggered the self-hatred mechanism in the
women who refused to go along with her as a "you can have it all"
representation of how far feminism had come? (Legs! Clothes! Family!
Career!)

These are some of the questions that swirled through my head as I stood
in the bar of a private club renowned for the eminence of its membership
two nights after Obama had swept the elections. The occasion was the
club's monthly dinner, and the bar was fitted out mostly with men in
tuxes, except for several women in suitably festive garb. (The
institution, like many such, had originally been a men's-only affair and
still retains much of its Old World, Masters of the Universe tone
despite the fact that it started admitting women in 1989.)

As I chatted with a small all-male group, one of them inquired after an
absent woman's physical appearance as though he were in a locker room
and another sheepishly asserted that he found Palin deeply attractive,
as though this were a disclosure unworthy of him -- or, perhaps, of the
club's standards of political correctitude. (Feeling it incumbent upon
myself to reassure him, in classic feminine fashion, I chimed in: "I
find her attractive myself.")

Minutes later a woman mouthed hello to me over the heads of this boyish
bunch and the short, bald man who had been dominating the conversation
snapped at her: "Let me finish my story!" By the time I bid goodnight,
the evening's patronizing atmosphere left me feeling as though I had
stepped out of line without saying much of anything and should take my
rightful place in hobble skirts in the back parlor with the rest of the
weaker sex.

These snatches of conversation might not ordinarily have struck me as
evidence of a sea change, a shift in the way that women are perceived,
if it were not for the fact that Hillary Clinton had recently been
demoted from presidential contender to possible secretary of state -- a
move that once again positions her as ready and willing to serve rather
than to command -- while Sarah Palin continues to brand herself on the
talk show circuit with the same astonishing bravura she exhibited as a
wild-card vice presidential nominee. Under these circumstances, it was
hard to bat away the feeling that keeps tugging at the back of my mind,
which is that although change may well be coming to Washington, the
public discourse about women has taken several steps backward. (A poll
conducted this week by The Daily Beast
<http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2008-11-18/the-barrier-t
hat-didnrsquot-fall/> confirms these suspicions.)

The evidence may be difficult to pin down, but it hovers in the
atmosphere, making this reversion felt in myriad ways. Once again, for
instance, it seems to be OK to talk about women as risible in their
aspirations to leadership; OK, too, for men openly to dismiss women as
social and intellectual equals, the better to focus on how they rate in
the all-important looks department. For a time, the feminist movement
forced this chauvinist mind-set to go underground, but now women-bashing
seems to be back in style. (And is it only me, or is there something
about women's attitude to other women, especially those in the
limelight, that seems to suggest that centuries of disenfranchisement
has produced the Stockholm Syndrome rather than Steadfast Sisterhood?)

Of course, any vaginal-American running for high office is instantly
consigned to the scrutiny of the reductionist male gaze and the
hypercritical female one. Hillary's cankles were as closely analyzed as
her competence, just as Nancy Pelosi, perhaps the most powerful woman in
government, is more famous for her pearls than her policies. What
Clinton failed to realize is that when it comes to female candidates,
accomplishment is a sideline; Americans, both men and women, want
gossip. Can she really believe we're more intrigued by what bills she's
helped pass than her relationship with Bill? Small wonder the woman
lost.

Strong women have always threatened men and will continue to do so as
long as women remain the primary caretakers of young children, the
front-line enforcers of society's inhibiting agenda. What seems newly in
evidence is how resistant women are, consciously or not, to putting one
of their own in power. It was, after all, a woman who asked John McCain
at a November campaign meeting the question that launched almost a
million You Tube hits: "How do we beat the bitch?" Young women today
appear less concerned about the limitations imposed on them with good
reason; they can indeed become lawyers and doctors with greater ease
than would have been imaginable in the 1950s. The attitude seems to be
that as feminist goals have gotten closer -- no matter that women are
still routinely paid less for their labor -- there's no need for the
strident rhetoric or far-reaching vision of the women's movement.

But here's something to give pause: The special election issue of The
New Yorker has five male writers commenting on its implications; there
is only one woman featured in the issue (although she has two pieces, as
if in compensation). Similarly, the November issues of Harper's and The
Atlantic are top-heavy with male writers, notwithstanding the fact that
The Atlantic cover touts a story headlined "Should Women Rule the
World?" which turns out to be a rather cutesy review of a book by DeeDee
Myers with that title, not a serious consideration of the question at
all.

Meanwhile, a recent issue of OK! magazine promised to tell readers about
Michelle Obama's style ("Michelle looks amazing in yellow") and "her
date nights with Barack." You know, girly stuff, as befits our interest
in a Grownup Girl. Can it be that Samuel Johnson, the 18th-century
writer and wit, was not all that far from contemporary truth when he
observed that when it came to women it was best to keep one's
expectations low: "Sir, a woman's preaching is like a dog's walking on
his hind legs. It is not done well; but you are surprised to find it
done at all."

If we keep our expectations low enough, the surprise is not that Hillary
Clinton didn't become our first woman president but that she made such a
strong showing in the primaries. A round of applause for the lady
walking on her hind legs.

If that is any indication of a feminist stance, than feminism needs to get in
touch with women.
"as though he were in a locker room"?  I mean, I've been around women talking
about a guy's physical appearance.  What's the big deal?  Its not clear.
"bald man who had been dominating the conversation snapped at her"  Yes,
interupting people is rude.  She did it.  I've done it.  Being upset about it
isn't the sign of some conspiracy - patriarchal or otherwise.
"if it were not for the fact the Hillary Clinton had recently been demoted from
presidential contender to possible secretary of state"  If you want to talk
about possible issues, it isn't that Clinton didn't become president - it's
that we don't have better examples of strong women in politics running for the
white house then Clinton and Palin.
"OK, too, for men openly to dismiss women as social and intellectual equals,
the better to focus on how they rate in the all-important looks department". 
Why does it have to be either/or?
The rest of that post gets even more ridiculous.  "vaginal-American"?? 
"reductionist male gaze"??  Presidential candidates get judged on their
appearance.  That has always been the case.  But if its Hillary, then its a
conspiracy?

about Orthodox Jews in the United States. An Orthodox Jewish woman cannot get a
divorce without getting a get (divorce) from her husband. She can obtain a
civil divorce from a U.S. court, but in her community, she's still considered
married and cannot remarry. The only way for her divorce to have any weight

Sharia in British culture debate> I think the problem is that BD is operating
under the assumption that Sharia is inherently oppressive. And the fact is,
much of it is not. A lot of sharia deals with civil matters, such as
enforcement of contracts, same as the Beth Din for Orthodox Jews. And BECAUSE
it is in Britain, both disputing parties have to VOLUNTARILY submit to the
Sharia court. If one party doesn't agree, it goes smack into the civil court.
So I really don't see that Britain is really giving up jurisdiction in anything
here. It's just like any civil dispute where the parties decide to resolve it
by other means besides going to court. Perfectly legal and frankly, keeps court
dockets clear for more important things.

Obviously, Sharia courts in Britain aren't allowed to impose the harsh
penalties towards crimes as those are criminal matters, and if the sharia court
tried, they'd be commiting a crime against Britain. Matters such as theft,
murder, (and yes, domestic violence!) are criminal matters and are dealt with
by British criminal courts, and they take their jurisdiction VERY seriously. So
as things stand, I really don't see the harm. Substitute sharia court for
neighborhood association. The sharia court in any western country only has
power if both parties submit themselves to it.

And frankly, it's a little insulting to assume that if a woman submits to
sharia law in a western country (as opposed to a Middle Eastern theocracy where
she doesn't have any choice) she doesn't know what she's doing. Women submit to
sharia law or wear the hijab for reasons of their own, not necessarily because
they are oppressed by men. I personally think Muslim women as victim is an
unflattering portrait because it's largely untrue. And the beauty of living in
a western country is that she can take her beef to the secular authorities any
time she wants.

In fact, while the oppression of women in Muslim countries is a serious issue,
the Western feminist tendency to paint them as victims does them a huge
disservice because it ignores their reality and their attachment to their own
religion and culture. Middle Eastern women do want more rights, but they want
those rights AS Muslims. They don't see being more Westernized as really the
solution (though I'm sure they would like the freedom to Westernize if they
wish; just as they wish for the freedom to express their culture.) Whether or
not to wear the hijab is really a minor issue. What they want is the freedom to
drive (in Saudi Arabia), the freedom to education, the freedom to enter
whatever vocation they choose, and equal pay. None of those freedoms are
explicity denied in the Koran or Sharia. These freedoms are being denied not so
much by the religion of Islam, but by longstanding tradition and patriarchy.

BD> Again, you irritate by your refusal to define terms.

But I will assert that you use "cult" wrongly in referring to Islam in Britain.
The definition of cult in modern terms is a close-knit group where all contact
with outsiders is strongly discouraged and often made impossible. Muslims are
assimilating fairly well in Britain and the US aside from a few pockets. I
work with Muslims. I almost married one. I don't think Sharia courts in the US
would have changed anything. I just don't know of any Muslim of my acquaintance
who would submit to them. And that's just it. Unless people volutarily submit
to their judgment, Sharia courts have NO power. So Britain gave up NADA in
terms of power or culture. Sometimes accomodation can be a powerful ruling
tactic, no? So if you think the Sharia court is some huge threat, it's not. It
will matter to only a few very religious Muslims, and everyone else, including
many Muslims, will ignore it.

I'm Jewish, but does that mean that the rulings of the Beth Din apply to me?
No. Because I'm not a member of that particular Orthodox community and I do not
recognize its authority. Religious courts are only relevant to those who
actually practice the religion. The general trend in Western countries is for
people to get LESS religious over generations. The younger generation of
Muslims will be less religious than their parents. It's natural and inevitable.
The only thing that will bollix that up is if the state appears to be
repressive towards a certain religion. That more than anything will get people
fired up and radicalized. Radicalized Muslims are a huge problem in the UK. You
don't reach radicalized youth by repressing them further. Allowing sharia
courts that only have a voluntary civil function is a very smart and classy
move to prevent further radicalization. And as future generations of British
Muslims become less religious, the sharia court will become less and less
relevant.

  Catholics work the same way.  A civil divorce is meaningless without the

Having known female Muslims in college, it is most definitely a choice. And I
find it offensive that people would term these savvy, educated women as somehow
brainwashed. Many of them didn't grow up with the hijab, and chose to wear it
as adults. And many of them have very thought-out reasons to do so, but the
problem is, people are so busy labeling them as brainwashed victims that no one
bothers to ASK what those reasons are.

To many women, the hijab is freedom because it stops men from viewing them as
sexual objects. In many ways, sexual objectification can be more oppressive
than not wearing whatever you please. I wouldn't want to wear the hijab, but I
totally understand this reasoning. The hijab only seems oppressive if women
have no other choice but to wear one. Hijabs are repressive in situations where
women are required to wear one by law. However, in Iran, where hijabs are still
mandatory, young women are finding very creative ways of flouting the law while
obeying the letter of it. They will often wear very revealing clothing while
keeping their hair covered. And if men give them any grief over it, they shout,
"You're a bad Muslim! You're not even supposed to be looking at me that way!"

Heh. Iranian women rock.

Interesting and well thought out responses, thank you.
But I can't help but think of FGM.  It is practiced by women in the cultures
that practice it, usually performed by women (in fact, I can think of no
culture where it is a man who does the actual act of FGM (that is, female
genital mutilation)).  By every standard you've brought to bear in this
discussion regarding Sharia to explain it as a choice, you can also explain FGM
as a choice.
I wonder, though, what percentage of feminists would argue that FGM should be

We were talking about Sharia courts in western countries which is a thing
totally different from FGM.

Apples and oranges. A Sharia court in a western country will not bring physical
harm to a woman. FGM always brings harm and should be stamped out, wherever it
is. Most women who undergo FGM do it when they are too young to consent. The
fact that many FGM practitioners are women does not make the process any less
heinous. It is almost always done under unsanitary conditions and many women
have medical complications the rest of their lives from it. It also has nothing
to do with Islam. There is nothing in the Koran which sanctions this practice.

A woman has to voluntarily submit herself to a sharia court in a western
country for it to have any effect. Girls who are subjected to FGM are too young
to "volunteer" for this brutal practice. It is NOT a choice.

The whole point of feminism is autonomy, no? Tell me how a young girl below the
legal age of consent can consent to this. Most of them don't want this to
happen, but are forced into it by their community. FGM usually happens before
puberty. A prepubescent girl cannot consent to her own mutilation by
definition.

Yes, a parent's kids shouldn't be able to make some choices regarding their
kids.  In a case like this, it doesn't really merit debate, does it?

I agree, but which culture should be allowed to make the determination as to
whether a choice is something a parent should be allowed to make?  Should the
foreign culture be used or should the native culture?
And why?

It's already a principle of law in this country that parents can't make the
final decisions for their daughters' reproductive health, parental notification
laws notwithstanding.

We shouldn't allow parents to harm their children in any way for the sake of
cultural practice.

The MacArthur Genius is training healthcare providers to work with African
women who've undergone female genital circumcision

By Elizabeth Barajas-Roman

Why did you decide to open the African Women's Health Center in Boston? When I
was doing my ob/gyn residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital, I gradually
developed a practice for African women who have circumcision... I grew up in
Sudan where circumcision was very comon. The African women felt comfortable
with me because I saw female circumcision as a matter of fact. Then, I
approached the leaders of the Brigham and Women's Hospital [to see] if they
were interested in formalizing an African center where we would be focusing on
women who had genital cutting and also reproductive health in general of
refugee women of African descent.

Was there any resistance to opening the center? When we opened it up, no one
showed up for several months... it was a bit of a puzzling moment. Then around
that time, I realized the community thought that I was financially benefiting
from the clinic. I had to go back into the community to say I'm a salaried
position. If you'd like to come see me, great, but I'm going to see anyone who
comes to see me. I intended to provide a service that was specifically for
them, but there was suspicion in the community.

Was this suspicion something that came from their experience in the United
States or from their homelands? I think it's both. The Somali community has
come from war zones. It is very rare that people do something for them. I had
to work very hard to establish trust to get them to understand that it's pure
recognition that there is a need in the community and my job is to fulfill that
need. And that I'm being selfish in that it gives me pleasure to fulfill the
need; not [that] there is any other ulterior motive.

The other portion is that in the United States, it gets very difficult for
immigrants and refugees to settle here and feel welcome.

Where are your patients from? The majority live in Boston, but I do have women
who travel from very far away... some come from Texas and California. I try to
prevent that, so I do a lot of counseling on the phone. The goal is to train
other physicians and not to have patients travel from afar. Most are immigrants
[and] refugees who don't have much funding, can't afford the finances or the
time to come see me.

And that goes back to training the residents. Most graduate and leave Boston.
For about 10 years, I've created a network of physicians who know are are
comfortable taking care of women who have been circumcised.

What are the most common misconceptions healthcare providers have about women
who've been circumcised? Health providers have a very difficult time
understanding that a cultural practice exists. And so when they look at women
who have been circumcised, as I try to tell them, even the slightest wince or
flinch or disapproval will turn off the patient and will prevent her from ever
coming back to that provider because that patient will feel she's been judged.

For women who've been circumcised, it's a done deal. It's over. But what ends
up happening, it's as if they are carrying a flag of, 'I am circumcised,' or,
'I've undergone female genital cutting,' along with them, and health providers
can't see beyond the scar and see the woman herself.

In fact, the circumcision is not so much of the big issue. Her biggest issue is
resettling in the United States, or how to get her children in the right
schools, or how to walk down the street and not feel ostracized because she is
wearing a hijab, the veil. So her main concerns have nothing to do with the
fact that she's been circumcised.

What about second-generation children, are there specific concerns you see? It
is incredibly interesting in that adolescents in general are going through a
sexual discovery. Even American teenagers are struggling with how they should
look... what should they be wearing, what kind of music they should be
listening to... all those social pressures come down on teenage girls.

And all that is the same for second-generation African girls. But they have one
more thing. They do physically look different than American women. Their
external genitalia is different. Something happened to them in their home
country and now they do look different... but then how does that play into
interactions with boys? So these are themes we are trying to explore,
understand and counsel with the teenage population.

Where do you see your practice five to ten years from now? My main goal is to
become obsolete. The purpose of my work is to train enough new health providers
to provide culturally competent care of women who've been circumcised so there
no longer has to be a specialty clinic. When it comes to issues on female
circumcision itself... the long-term goal is prevention.

Development program at Hampshire College.

Huh? FGM creates harm because it causes lifetime medical issues. It's also done
under extremely unsanitary conditions, as well as making sex permanently
painful. It is just bad for female reproductivew health altogether.

Are you always such a relativist? Would you actually support FGM just because
it's a cultural practice? And I would think a physician who works with women
who've had FGM done to them would have a lot to say about it.

There a lot of cultural practices that have thankfully died out, say,
sacrificing children or stoning adulterers. Would you campaign for their
revival?

And to say that my post said "nothing" is just offensive dismissal and over the
line. You should talk, the way you refuse to define your terms.

Saudi judge refuses to annul 8-year-old's marriage

By Mohammed Jamjoom
CNN

(CNN) -- A Saudi judge has refused for a second time to annul a marriage
between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man, a relative of the girl told
CNN.

The most recent ruling, in which the judge upheld his original verdict, was
handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza, where late last year the same
judge rejected a petition from the girl's mother, who was seeking a divorce for
her daughter.

The relative said the judge, Sheikh Habib Al-Habib, "stuck by his earlier
verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once
she reached puberty." The family member, who requested anonymity, added that
the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter.

The case, which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups,
came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a
legal technicality. The judge ruled the girl's mother -- who is separated from
the girl's father -- was not the girl's legal guardian and therefore could not
represent her in court, according to Abdullah al-Jutaili, the mother's lawyer.

The girl's father, according to the attorney, arranged the marriage in order to
settle his debts with the man, who is "a close friend" of his. At the time of
the initial verdict, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge
that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili told
CNN. The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty, she will have the
right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court, the lawyer
said.

Last month, an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify
the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case
back to al-Habib for reconsideration.

Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that
the marriage was still in effect, but that a challenge to the marriage was
still ongoing. The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and
a hearing is scheduled for next month, according to the relative.

The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply
conservative kingdom recently. While rights groups have been petitioning the
government to enact laws that would protect children from this type of
marriage, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as
10 to wed.

"It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15
and younger," Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in
remarks last January quoted in the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. "A girl aged 10
or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong and they are
being unfair to her."

Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about
parents forcing their underage daughters to marry.

"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls," he said,
according to the newspaper. "We should know that Sharia law has not brought
injustice to women."

Sharia law is Islamic law. Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of
Islam called Wahhabism.

CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment.

Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN in
December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child
marriages.

"We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months
because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger --
especially so when girls are traded off to older men," Wilcke said.

Wilcke explained that while Saudi ministries may make decisions designed to
protect children, "It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in
the courts, and in many realms beyond the court."

Last December, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run
Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child
marriages.

"The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,"
al-Harithi said. "Child marriages violate international agreements that have
been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed." He added that his
organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage
from taking place.

Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in
Saudi Arabia, told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means
standing against those who want to "keep us backward and in the dark ages."

She said the marriages cause girls to "lose their sense of security and safety.
Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a
lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression."

Gerladine Ferraro died this week.  She was a pioneer, and a great hero of mine
when I was young.  She had so much courage, to stand up as a national candidate
when no other women out there were visible enough to do so with her.  Pity her
candidacy was shot down by allegations - were they ever proven? - against her
husband.  She was held to a different standard.  Apparently, if a woman's
husband is crooked, she can't be honest.  Of course, if a man cheats repeatedly
on his wives, dumps one as she's recovering from cancer and fucks his aide soon
after the second is diagnosed with MS, he's a perfectly viable candidate.

*gags*

Hilary Clinton could never have aspired to high office had it not been for
Ferraro.  RIP Geraldine.
