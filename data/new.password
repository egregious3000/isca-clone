Now choose a password for this system.  It is a good idea to choose a password
that another person, even one who knows you very well, would be unable to
guess.  Try something with punctuation, or a nonsense word such as glumph.  It
is in your best interest to choose a password that no one else will guess,
because you are held responsible for the conduct of your account and your
privilege to use this BBS will be suspended if your account is used to take
actions that violate BBS rules.  Please do make sure you choose a password you
can remember, however, as getting it reset isn't an easy process.
