Well, my dynasty league's rookie draft is just about done and I'm feeling
extremely good about how it went.   We start 2 QB, 2 RB, 4 WR, 2 TE, and a
WR/TE flex... and TE get 1 pt PPR, WR get .5, and RB get .25.   So the
positions are fairly balanced.  Though we also have a salary cap and contracts,
and the RBs are still making a bit more than they should though it's getting
closer to what it should be.

I've done well enough that in the 5 years the league has been around I don't
think I've had earlier than the 9th pick, which makes it hard to get any top
players.  Especially as we use an NFL-style draft where you pick in the same
spot every round instead of serpentine.

In any event, I had a lot of extra picks because I traded some players last
year for picks.   First round RBs cost $48... QB cost $15, TE cost $11 and WR
cost $8.  (That's set based on average of player salaries at their position
amongst veterans).  I ended up getting:

1.04 WR Dez Bryant $8  (traded 2011 1st, 2nd and 3rd round picks to move up)
1.09 QB Jimmy Clausen $15
1.10 WR Mike Williams (TB) $8
1.11 TE Jermaine Gresham $11
2.09 WR Jordan Shipley $6
3.09 TE Tony Moeaki (KC) $4
4.02 RB Ben Tate $1
4.09 RB LeGarrette Blount $1

I gave up a lot of 2011 picks to get Dez Bryant, but I need another top WR
after losing Steve Smith when his contract was up... plus I had to Transition
tag Larry Fitzgerald to retain him which ended up nearly doubling his salary to
$68.   I also had to tag Brady which effectively doubled his salary when I
matched the bidding on him at $60.

Very very happy with this group of players.  I think Williams and Gresham will
get enough playing time to start for me this year, and those are cheap for
starter salaries.  Shipley will, I think, be the WR2 on Cinci in the next 3
years and will probably play the slot by the end of this year.  Cinci throws to
the TE more than you'd think, they just have never had a TE who could catch to
make something of it, so Gresham should work out well.  I also think Moeaki
takes over the starting TE spot on pass plays in KC by the end of the year.
Williams is a 1st round talent who slid because of character issues.  He's
already apparently locked up the top WR spot in Tampa.

And Tate was just icing on the cake then.  I can stash him on IR so he doesn't
take up a roster spot... and a $1 RB who has a chance to become a starter is
gold in this league, where the top RBs are costing $90.   Had to wait until the
4th round before RB prices dropped (they are $32 in round 2, $16 in round 3),
but I'd traded last year to get an early 4th round pick just for this
situation, hoping a decent RB would be there just because no one would pay him
$16.

I have one more pick to make at 5.08, got my eye on Stephen Williams in Arizona
who is doing well and looks like he's probably already their WR4.

ok, i've seen some strange drafts in my day, but WOW. Just completed a draft
and this one guy made some of the strangest/dumbest picks i've seen. 6 of his
first 7 picks were from the same team. I mean i get being a fan of a team, but
if you're drafting a fantasy team that's generally something you should try and
avoid.

1 - 11(11)      T Romo (DAL-QB)
2 - 0(12)       J Witten (DAL-TE)
3 - 11(35)      A Gates (SD-TE)
4 - 0(36)       F Jones (DAL-RB)
5 - 11(59)      M Barber (DAL-RB)
6 - 0(60)       D Bryant (DAL-WR)
7 - 11(83)      Dallas (DST)

I am by no means an expert fantasy drafter, but i mean seriously who would
draft like that amd expect good results?

So both of my leagues are done drafting and tagged player auctioning/rookie
drafting/vet auctioning.  Both start 1 QB, 2 RB, 1 flex QB/RB, 4 WR, 2 TE, 1
flex WR/TE.   RB .25 PPR, WR .5, TE 1.0.   So the top players at each position
are about equal in value.

League 1 I have:
QB: *Cutler, *McNabb, Garrard, J. Freeman, Vick, Whitehurts
RB: *A. Peterson, *Deangelo, A. Foster, Chester Taylor, L. Johnson, Westbrook,
   Gerhart
WR: *S. Smith (CAR), *S. Moss, *Knox, *Cribbs, *Floyd, Clayton, Walter, Jenkins
TE: *Gates, *Cooley, Moeaki

That league gives 1/35 kick return points, which gives Knox a nice boost and
Cribbs a huge boost... he had 2000 kick return yards last year, so that's like
adding in another 500+ yards receiving.

League 2 is a salary cap league.  I have:
QB: *Brady $60, *Henne $14, Freeman $13, Clausen $14, Gradkowski, Pennington,
    Troy Smith, Whitehurst, Hoyer
RB: *Turner $25, *A. Foster $1, M. Barber $25, Caddy Williams $2, Larry
    Johnson, Jeremiah Johnson, Hillis, Norwood, Ringer
WR: *Fitzgerald $68, *Sims-Walker $34, *Dez Bryant $8, *Floyd $2, Meachem $11,
    M. Williams (TB) $8, M Williams (SEA) $1, S. Williams, Galloway, Shipley,
    Josh Morgan, Jenkins
TE: *Witten $83, *Winslow $33, *Gresham $11, S. Nelson, Moeaki


Salaries may look odd at times as we have multi-year contracts, extensions that
come with raises, franchise tags, etc.  So one player you might get on the
cheap before he breaks out and have him for a few years while another guy (like
Witten) you pay premium money on.

Really happy with my off-season in the second league.  I got Winslow,
Sims-Walker and Marion Barber out of the vet auction, all at well below what I
think they are worth.   I had three 1st round picks from trades I made last
year and picked up Clausen, Gresham, and TB Mike Williams with them, and I
traded my 1st, 2nd and 3rd round rookie picks next year for the pick I used on
Dez Bryant.   I also managed to get Ben Tate for $1 and can stash him on IR...
he will take up $1 of my $500 cap, but won't take up a roster space.

Also was glad to get Freeman as a backup QB.  I traded Greg Olsen for him after
I picked up Winslow in the auction to go with Witten and Gresham.  I can extend
his contract to $23 and keep him for 4 seasons, which is a great price for any
starting QB.

pick did. I get things ironed out then see I have to wait like 3 days or so for

and jogged lightly during early warm-ups at the Edward Jones Dome. "Jackson
made no hard cuts. He did not accelerate hard. He did nothing that made me

Basically it is two teams sharing roster space beyond the level that the spirit
of individual teams calls for.   They are likely sharing bye week players, and
possibly stashing a player on the other's roster so they won't lose him if cut
to waivers, then getting him back when they have the roster space again or the
other guy needs the space back.

point to him starting. ESPN's Ed Werder reported this morning that Favre said
the ankle had improved so much that he might not even take a pain killing
injection before the game. He said the pain is pretty much gone from his ankle
and now is just in his toes. He'll have a special shoe fitted with protection
for his toes and should be good to go. Again though, the guy that supposedly
makes the final decision, Brad Childress, has not commented. But most everyone
is like ESPN's Chris Mortensen who said he'd be "shocked" if Favre does not
start today.

Here's an interesting strategy situation.

Currently, in one fantasy league, I'm leading by three points.

I have Mendenhall running tonight.  My opponent is done - all his players
played yesterday.

Theoretically, the only way I can lose is if Mendenhall has a horrific game
tonight and manages to score negative points.

However, there could be "score corrections" made - it happens sometimes - that
change the outcome of the match.

Also, the Yahoo system ranks teams by record and then points scored.  The 10-15
points expected by Mendenhall could possibly make the difference between a
playoff berth or not at the end of the season.


Is it better to bench Mendahall and leave the RB spot 'empty' for 0 points
pretty much gauranteeing me a win, or leave Mendenhall in to (probably) get
some points that may go towards determining playoff contention later?

My immediate impression is that you are giving up two guys who should be, at
best, riding your bench and are probably available in most leagues for pickup.

And you're picking up a starter in Santana Moss.

Honestly, unless you're playing in a 15-team league or something , you could
probably find two better players for their position in free-agency than
Crabtree and Palmer.  High expectations, but the reality is that neither one of
these guys is a week to week starter.

You're giving up, essentially nothing you need, and you're taking away a
potential starter - Santana Moss - from your opponent.  I mean, if he wants to
start Crabtree and Palmer on any given week - he should feel free.

You're not getting anyone you're going to start in return, but Moss makes a
tolerable addition to your bench and denies your opponents the opportunity to
play him.

The odd thing is that he is the 7th highest (out of 10) in order of points

Almost everyone is within about ten spots of their fantasy ranking, though it

Wow, I have a tough decision this week in one of my leagues:

I have three wide receiver slots.   My options (& 3 week scoring history) are:
   Wes Welker (NE)      22.6,   11.0,   14.6            @ Den
   Percy Harvin (MIN)   16.6,   29.5,   16.9            vs NO
   Antonio Brown (PIT)   8.6,   13.6,   21.1            @ SF
   Miles Austin (DAL)      0,      0,   12.8

Obviously Austin is just coming back from injury (hence the two 0's).  He put
up a decent day last Sunday, but still less than the other three receivers.

None of the teams have a particularly daunting defensive matchup this weekend.
Do I dare keep Austin on my bench this weekend?

I take it this isn't traditional ESPN scoring?

Depends on the scoring, but I'm pretty sure you'd be better off if Atlanta's
defense had a good day and Manning had a poor one.  It's pretty safe to say
that the total points coming out of "Manning great day + Falcons D poor day" is
going to be greater than "Manning poor day + Falcons D great day".

With a 40 point lead, you've probably got a good chance to win regardless, but
if I were you, I'd be rooting against Peyton.

2 questions...I've got 3 QB's on my roster at the moment and i'm looking to
trade 1 for a WR. Which 2 should i keep/Which one should i trade. Matthew
Stafford, Aaron Rodgers or Matt Schaub, and second question. Is trading Cedric
Benson for Jamal Charles a good trade? Keep in mind that i already have Ray
Rice, MJD and Steven Jackson as RBs on my team

BODY: 
That's a tough one.  I'd definitely do Charles for Benson...Charles is far more
explosive and is likely to get more touches than Benson as KC is a more run-
oriented offense.

The QB question...not sure about that one.  I think Green Bay's offense will be
OK in the long run, so I wouldn't trade Rodgers.  The other two are both injury
prone.  Stafford passes more and has better overall weapons, but he will
probably face better teams/defenses throughout the season.  Schaub has a better
RB at his disposal so will probably pass less, but his schedule is markedly
easier.

Stafford is the riskier guy, but he's probably more rewarding in a given week.

If you're starting Rodgers every week (which you probably should), then you'd
only start one of the other two a couple of times at most...so I'd keep
Stafford and trade Schaub.

But if I looked closer at the schedules/matchups, I might change my mind on
that.

I always thought it would be cool to have a combination of badminton and
baseball.  We could call it Badballs.  Basically, it'd be played over a net but
with tougher rackets and a baseball.  Spiking the ball could earn the receiving
player a black eye or worse, so appropriate gear would be important.  I'm also
not opposed to including sand courts, possibly with sand pit obstacles.

I have 3 QBs...drafted Eli Manning and Ben Roethlisberger, picked up Peyton
Manning as a free agent a week into the season.

This week, I have a dilemma -- do I play Ben or Peyton?  Ben plays the Redskins
at home, while Peyton plays the Saints at home.  Both opponents have bad pass
defense, both opponents also have offenses that could also put up points.

I probably can't lose either way...but I'm struggling with the choice.

Dear God!
This place is almost as bad as my last work place.
We got way too many Chiefs and not nearly enough Indians.
Everyone has their way of doing things.
How the fuck can I learn "the store system" when we have no coherant
overarching policy laid out by corporate?

The other night I worked with a cashier whose mom works days. This girl has
about 3 weeks in and yet her drawer is always short (no idea by how much except
the other night she said she was told it was about $72). Now our closing
cashiers have a list apiece of things to do (we basically divide the sales
floor in half for cleaning and we BOTH are to do the dressing rooms and the go
backs). This girl spends most of her time up by her register and at least twice
she disappeared. How the fuck can I do both our jobs on the floor plus run my
register? And after closing my Key Holder (our term for a Lead) let her mom
plus another co-worker and her boyfriend into the store AFTER we had closed for
the night. Hello! Can we say Security Risk? I don't give a flying fuck if two
of the 3 work there! We are NOT supposed to let people in after we have closed.
And you let them all wander around. *shakes head*

Friday night (the earlier was Thursday) I work with a new cashier who stays up
by her register and who disappeared 3x on me. O she is nice enough but I cannot
do my job, both our floor jobs and help load items for 3 customers and expect
to get all of my work done. I only hope she improves.
O yes, my boss called aside and said "I know there are 3 sides to every story"
before saying he was told I didn't want to do my work and I'd questioned my Key
Holder about it. Um, no I did not. It was the girl who was in the sore after
hours that I said something to. She asked if I knew houw to do something and I
said yes, but that I hadn't gotten to that area yet.

Tonight I worked with a good worker but the same Key Holder as last night
(Thursday was a different one, one who is now on vacation). This Key Holder
told me I'd done women's shoes wrong by doubling them up on the shelf in areas.
I told her the Asst. Manager told me to do it. She relied that the Manager had
told her to not do that. Then she quickly added "Well, they'll have to work
that out by themselves." I'm sorry, I'll side witht he Asst. Manager as she
OUTRANKS you and the Manager has said nothing to me. He told me to learn from
the girl who does shoes. Well, when I tried to ask her something she just looks
at me funny but says nothing. You (Key Holder) say the back shelves are messy
but when I told you how my trainer instructed me you say "well, thats not my
way." OK, if you want it done YOUR WAY then you better goddamn show me how YOUR
WAY looks. I can only do as I am trained to do. My co-worker tonight was the
one who said "There are too many Chiefs and not enough Indians around here" to
me tonight after you got cranky.

Damn, I wish I was working with Julie. She is always nice and I enjoy her
company.

Hello great lovers of horrible triple digit heat!

This is a short post (before I black out of said heat), that I talked with
Aightball and that discussion of restaurants, the disappearance of restaurants
(assumming that you are not drunk) can be handled in food.

Hope is this of help, and if you are in the part of the country that serves
Culver's Custard, damn you lucky person. :)

you mean.  So, when I email you, asking for clarification, telling me to search

Holy fucking christ! I was doing my job and yet my one keyholder kept calling
out asking where I was. I was cleaning the store you simpleton! You had closed
out my register for the night so I went to DO MY JOB which is to clean the
store. Actually it is the job of all employees who close. Calling out my name
and asking where I am every 2 minutes is just fucking annoying. If it is really
that important to know where I am go into the office and look at the camera
feeds.
Then the other keyholder calls out over the PA that my checks were off by $6
saying I overcharged a customer. Umm, no I didn't. My customers KNOW what they
owe as I read off the prices as I enter them into the register and they get
told the sub-total BEFORE I enter the payment method of their choosing (Cash or
Credit Card). If they choose CC they see the register tape after I swipe their
CC and they also get the CC receipt as well as the tape to sign. NONE said I
overcharged them.
You want to point out something like this to me? Call me up to the front and do
it one-on-one. It is Unprofessional to announce it over the PA so everyone can
hear. Also, I asked the other keyholder to see this on my machine's journal but
was told "Its OK, everyone makes mistakes"
Umm, I could care less if everyone makes mistakes, I want to see proof I did as
you say I did. In my career as a cashier I have NEVER overcharged someone.

Gripes to almost-8-yr-old blow-ups before the first day of school.  She knows
the routine.  Get up...get dressed...eat breakfast...shoes on...hair and teeth
brushed.  So, when her mom asks her, did you do these things, and she says yes.
 And it's 15 mins till you got to be to school, only to come out and find she
has only gotten dressed, then you miss eating breakfast.  That's how it works.
You wanted to watch cartoons instead of eat breakfast.  Your choice, your
consequence.

Having a breakdown and saying "You made me miss breakfast!" and "I'm going to
tell the teacher you starve me!" doesn't get you breakfast.  Getting out of the
car and immediately telling the gym teacher on the curb who is helping kids
that your mom is starving you isn't going to get your mom in trouble.  The gym
teacher told your mom she understood and not to worry about it.

Gripes to the gym teacher though.  Apparently she let our daughter eat
breakfast anyway at school.  How is the kid going to learn about logical
consequences.  I tell you what, missing breakfast one morning, she is a LOT
less likely to repeat those decisions.

I have a mind to complain to the teacher about it.  It's bullshit.  Let us
parent.

Gripes to fucking Dell.  I liked the quote you gave me.  I just asked if we
could do anything about the price.  I get a new quote saying, "Our finance team
was able to approve a higher discount."  I open the quote and look at the
price.  I think great!  They've met my price-point and saved us $175.  I then
send the Quote onto Purchasing.

Cut to 1.5 months later when I have the server and go to set it up.  I see only
8 GB instead of 16 GB.  I confirm that it's reading what it's supposed to and
go look at the quote.  Apparently you guys also reduced the RAM by half on the
quote!  No wonder the price was lower.  Higher discount my ASS.

Upon a line by line inspection, you also changed the processor from a Xeon
X5650 to a Xeon X5560.  That one number change is the difference between going
from a 6-core to a 4-core processor.  On a two processor machine, that's going
from 12 cores to 8 cores in processing power.  WTF!!!

I also noticed going from a PERC H700 down to a PERC6i RAID controller.  I am
positive you have downgraded things enough that it MORE than covers that $175
"discount" you gave us.  You've probably made more money on me!

FUCK.  Now what...what can you do to fix this...do I have to send the server
back?  Are you going to tell me I'm fucked and I gotta deal?  I tell you what,
you will make this right or I will be buying HP exclusively from now on.

Why wouldn't you tell me you completely changed the quote?  Perhaps this is on
me for not examining line by line looking for two number changes...you know, 16
to 8 and 5650 to 5560.  *Sighs*

Goddammitsomuch! Get physicaly therapy earlier this year. Get the final bill
after insurance, send in a check. start getting calls. I explain I sent a
check. a couple of months after sending the check, it has not cleared, so I
send another. A couple of more months, still has not cleared, and getting calls
every day. Say "fuck this" and drive to the place, even though it is out of the
way. Pay them in person. Start driving home, and about everything on the car
goes haywire. Do some looking, find a recall on a module, and everyone who has
had problems, had the exact same problems as me. I should be ok, but I am
expecting to hear that the power sterring assist module which has a recall will
be replaced, but that the transmission, which stopped shifting when everything
went nuts will not be covered, and even tho I have 20k on the original
warranty, I still will have to cover the cost for a replacement. Just how my

Gripes to timing.  My thesis is not going well.  I fucking hate the program I'm

show. In the meantime, I've been getting used to not working, being able to
pick my kid up from preschool, stay up late, sleep late, etc.  Even this little
PT gig I got hasn't gotten in the way of all that.

Now, I get a call about an interview for what could be my dream job.  It's
going to be a bit of a drive, and I'll be working a lot of weekends (probably).
So if I get it, when is my thesis getting done?  Who the hell knows.  I am just
SO not used to working anymore...the thought of actually getting a full time
job again scares the hell out of me.  Granted, it means the hubby can quit his

Oh, this is even better. After I explain that nothing has functionally changed
on the original PC, that it might as well have been rebooted, you are saying
that the shortcut to launch the app is missing from the desktop, so that is
functionally different, and thusly the cause of the problem. Not that the
program has a shortcut in the startup menu that points to the executable. It is
the missing shortcut on the desktop that is the problem, and since I deleted
it, I am to blame for the program not working.
Well, let me just restore that shortcut I deleted because we did not want this
program running on two computers at one time.
Oh, you will also have to understand that the shortcut on the startup menu was
also deleted, and restored before you could look, so maybe that is also the
problem.

*sigh*. My sister is so self centred and annoying, but God forbid anyone tells
her that.. if she knew how I really felt, all hell would break loose and I
would lose access to my neices (just like earlier this year). I just have to
bite my tongue and not pull her up on anything.. no wonder I keep to myself as
much as I do.

She just called to ask how my work week is this week (ummm lets see. I work in
a supermarket, it's Xmas week, I am doing 6 days so I can have Xmas eve off..
nah, it's just another week </sarcasm>. It's not one of the two busiest times
of the year!!!)

After asking her a few times why, she finally tells me that her hubby (AJ) will
probably have to fly north to visit his BIL who has just been given a death
sentence. Apparently BIL had a tumour (melenoma) removed last year but it's
come back and he hasn't had check ups etc. With an op, he might live until the
end of Jan. But they aren't sure if they can operate.  AJ has known BIL more
than half his life and so therefore wants to go see him before he dies..

Dont get me wrong, this is sad and I understand why AJ wants to go up. But
seriously, they aren't close. AJ barely talks to his sister. His sister comes
to our state the weekend of my nieces birth but doesn't tell AJ, or ask to see
my niece etc. She visits her dad (who was staying with AJ) at AJs house, but
still doesn't think to call/text AJ to let him know.. AJ goes to her state for
a work holiday but doesn't call in to see her or BIL.. they aren't close.

My sister said it would be like if A or B (cousins of ours that I have known my
whole life but in the last 20 years may have only seen less than a handful of
times in person since they live in another country) getting a death sentence
and how we would want to go see them. No offence. But I wouldn't. Yeah, I would
be sad and hate that it is happening, but I wouldn't have the finances to jump
on a plane and go visit them. We have a big extended family. If it was my BIL
who lived 12 hours away that got sick, I wouldn't jump on a plane/go see him.
I'd email/write but that's it. And my relationship with that sister is worse
than AJ's with his. He at least gets birthday/christmas greetings from his.

Anyway. My sis expects everyone to drop everything and put their lives on hold
to help her out. She works 5 nights in a fortnight and earns MORE than me who
works 38+ hours a week. But she wants to try and get time off on the BUSIEST
week of the year to babysit my nieces so *she* doesn't have to call in sick for
one of her 2 shifts this week (mum is babysitting for the other shift). She
will happily call in sick when she has been to the casino all night and hadn't
been able to get any sleep before her shift, but to call in sick to look after
her kids, that's another story.

And lately it has all been about how they had to find another place to live
(finally they did and moved on Tues) but now it is about how much money it has
cost (they offered 3 months rent to try and get the place and now she is pissed
coz the owners took her up on it!.. then there is the cost of the removalist,
and the people to clean the old place (heaven forbid THEY clean it!!) and it
being Christmas etc etc etc...

She thinks they are so hard done by, but if she wanted she can do extra shifts
at work (for better money) through an agency.. which I cant coz I am already
full time, and my company doesn't like paying overtime!. She keeps saying how
well AJ is doing as a real estate agent but then says he didn't get all his
commission etc. She gets benefits from the government coz of her kids (I dont
have kids so dont get benefits). She has mum babysit for her at all times for
free..  She tells me how strapped for cash they are but then tells me she went
through $400 at the casino (did I mention she has a gambling addiction at went
to gamblers anon and had them pay off part of her debts.. but she still
continues to gamble??!!!)

She keeps telling me how tired she is because of all this moving etc and how
the kids wake up early.. I ask if she goes to bed when they do and she says
no.. she stays up until late (most times around midnight) even though her kids
have been getting up at 5am..

She also asked me yesterday to lie to my doc the next time I go so I can get a
prescription for her for something to stop smoking (where you are only allowed
a script every 2 years). She said AJs getting his dad to get a script for him
too.. Are you serious??? She looked mad when I said my docs know I am a non
smoker (since I was recently diagnosed with diabetes, they have done a full
medical history and asked if I smoke/drank etc). Why should I lie for her? She
gave up smoking (finally) earlier this year.. and then went on a holiday and
said she had a smoke while drinking. And then came back and started up again.
She doesn't want to stop. Even though they are strapped for money, she can
afford smokes (and AJ can afford grog).. she and AJ used to hide in the garage
to smoke (so they kids didn't see it), now they just sit on the deck and do it.
They have stopped caring about the kids health.

*sigh*. Yep, she has frustrated me.. and I have to keep this all to myself.
Especially at this stressful time of the year..

BODY: 
Gripes to ice.  Every other road had no ice.  Everything else was melted.
But...shade = unmelted ice => hitting the ice patch and sliding off the road,
over a small street sign and knocking my side mirror on a mailbox post,
knocking the mailbox off.

I doubt this will total out the car, but this is just annoying.  Luckily I have
an emergency fund, so this isn't an OMG!!!! moment.  Just a "well, crap..."
moment.

Still...we didn't need this incident delaying our money plans.  :P  But, I do
thank God that I wasn't hurt, and that I was able to drive out of the ditch.

In the next 20 mins while waiting for the tow truck, I saw another car go off
the road on the same patch of ice, just on the opposite side of the road.  And
in the time it took me to go to the shop and then back to let the people know I
had jacked up their mailbox, the second driveway's mailbox was taken out.  That
makes three in at most 1.25 hrs.  I left a voicemail for the street crews to
send out a salt-truck.  If only someone had called it in sooner, perhaps I
wouldn't have had an accident.

Gripes indeed.  This isn't how I wanted to start my week.  :P

I've been meaning to write this for a while, but fuzzies to the person/people
who shoveled our driveway from 8" of snow at Christmas. We were snowed in at my
parents and we not looking forward to the shoveling job awaiting us at home.
What a huge surprise to see the driveway shoveled!!! We assumed it was our
neighbor from work but he didn't do it because he came home to find his
driveway shoveled, too, and it wasn't our other neighbors as they were on
vacation and their driveway was shoveled as well.

While we aren't sure 100% who did it, we have an idea of who you are, and we'll
remember this. Thank you so much and it's so great to know that there are
people in the world as giving as you.

I like the way Paul Tillich approaches the topic, because for me the more
profound question is not "where did it all come from?" but "why is there
anything at all?"  Whether god is part of the equation or not, just the fact
that anything exists in any manner, is pretty stunning, and its equally
stunning with or without god.  For Tillich god was no mere Creator, but the
"ground of being" by which he meant (as I read Tillich -- I could be misreading
him) that god is the underlying principle of existence. So god is not a Creator
or a being of any sort, because then god would be conditional and god must be
unconditional and underly existence. Note that Tillich's ground of being is
distinct from and more primitive than Aristotle's unmoved mover. Tillich's god
is not a mover or capable of motion.

*do* compete with science when they try to make actual factual claims which can
be tested and falsified.

A spirituality which makes claims about truth is *not* apples and oranges with
science. It is in direct competition for the better explanation.

Spirituality as analogy = good
Spirituality as an explanation = bad

One thing I like about science is that it admits its ignorance. It's okay to
say "we think the big bang happened (though we are not 100% sure), but we
simply cannot know about anything before it."

Many versions of spirituality/religion cannot accept ambiguity and ignorance,
because they strive to be absolute, fundamental truth about everything.


Main point: Spirituality as analogy is useful, but that's where it should stop.

I realize that individuals can be very persistent and arrogant. But as a
general practice, science has mechanisms to correct itself, acknowledge its
ignorance, and account for it.

Religion/Spirituality much less so, if at all.


The scientific method is *all about* realizing how flawed we are, and trying to
come up with better ways of gathering information and forming conclusions
*because* we realize our limitations.

I'm not sure religionists are more certain than scientists. Most of the ones I
know have a lot of doubts and questions and even though they may be part of a
well established faith tradition, still question and discuss and explore and
continue to learn.

The problem is that both religion and science are things done by humans, and
*some* humans are jerks and assholes and idiots, who refuse to consider that
they might be wrong or that they have anything to learn from others. So
jerkiness is a problem with both religion and science. And the jerks tend to
have very loud voices, to boot.

Except that many religions claim direct influence by God, right?

It's not like "oh, we thought about life for a while, and we really think it's

No, it's "God gave these instructions" or "God came to earth to save you and
THAT SHIT REALLY HAPPENED" or "God talked directly to this prophet, so the shit
he said is, like totally true".


I have no real beef with a philosophical spirituality, informed by science. I
think that's a pretty healthy and intelligent way to approach life.

I do have a beef with forms of religion or spirituality which are based on
falsifiable events or people, or that claim exclusive access to god, or claim

Giraffe and Faunus, agree completely, as usual.

Capa and JL:

But see, the response was "where did God come from"? The implication there is
that God is no kind of answer, because then we're just going to ask where God
comes from. Then when the theist goes, "I don't know", or "God always existed",
the other person starts talking about how this is stupid because everything has
a cause, Etc. And my point in responding to that is this.

JL says it's OK for science to admit its ignorance, in fact it's healthy. Capa
says the universe could have just existed. Giraffe says we might never know
what's beyond the singularity, as it were. It seems to me, that's the same kind
of thing as "God", I mean this philosophically. There's God, he's always
existed, and we can't know anything beyond God. My whole point is, the
scientist who says "yeah we can't really know anything beyond the singularity
we think, that's just the nature of the universe", and the theologian who says
"we can't really know anything beyond God, that's just how the universe works",
are making the exact same point about knowledge. So if you have a problem with
the theologian's answer, because you insist something had to come before God,
then you should have the exact SAME problem with the scientist's answer,
because something had to come before the singularity.

Now I agree with Giraffe, science and religion/spirituality/whatever yo ucall
it are very different, and I take them exactly like Giraffe does. But
philosophically speaking, the problem of infinite regression applies in both
cases under discussion. So in that sense, science and religion are making the
same argument, there's this point beyond which we can't know anything else,
this is it, this is the first cause we can find. And if you have a problem with
one for lacking a cause, you should have a problem with all such theories, see
Faunus' excellent idea about natural numbers for an explanation.

But religion must have a foundation of spirituality, and if it's based on
communication from God, then it implies some authority. If a person really
talks to God, and you believe that they did, then what they say carries a bit
more weight than someone who just wandered off and thought about things for a
while.

>What nuance was lost? Whose ignorance increased?

The nuance in the difference between religion and spirituality. Many religious
people don't understand how you can be spiritual but not religious. They don't
even grasp it.

Close, but not exactly. I agree that the "first cause" argument fails from both
camps.

But science claims ignorance. There may be more, but we can't know it. We are
blind to the first cause.
Religion claims to have found the first cause itself.

Science claims ignorance, religion claims certainty. Might I suggest you
haven't read much theology?

I'm also skeptical of your authority. I suspect you mean "authority" in the
sense of a sort of rule over, I'm awesome or whatever and so you should do what
I say. But for me, if I really believe you've talked to a god, the authority
isn't "wow you talked to a god so I'd better believe everything you say", it's
more like "wow you talked to a god, you know what you're doing". Just like "wow
you can really play the hell out of basketball and I can't. So you know what
you're doing when it comes to basketball". That doesn't mean I think you can't
be wrong or anything, it just means you get more weight than somebody who's
never played, if we're discussing basketball. It's the same kind of authority I
derive from any sort of experience.

  Now I'm not saying that's authority in religion. There are all sorts of
instances of what I'll call bad authority, the stuff you describe, that dude
heard from a god so we'd better do/believe whatever he said without question.
But I don't think what I've just described is particularly weird either. Again,
this is where some actual data on religion helps, and why I'm so interested in
people getting more of it. I'm explaining these things from my perspective
because I know it best, but my point is, people sort of talk about religion
like it's some abstract thing, "oh if Bob talked to God of course Bob's an
authority", rather than something people DO, "OK, let's go actually talk to
people and see how they actually TAKE Bob talking to God"? Happily, I've got
something like that handy.

truth. That's where we get the stupidity of people believing that the planet
Earth is 6000 years old, among others. The Bible (and most Holy Scriptures)
have good teachings about social interaction and teaching what is right vs.

the world - Christianity, Islam, Judaism. They each claim to have a direct

I know that not all theologies are the same way, of course. But when you're
talking about religion in America, for example, you're pretty much talking
about Christianity, for the most part. If you want to talk about what drives
culture more than anything else.


Danix> The problem I have with accepting any kind of 'right and wrong' from a
book like the Bible is that it's very foundation is questionable all the way
down. So why would I put any faith in its conclusions?

Granted, they may not be bad. The golden rule is pretty damn good. But it's
good for other reasons, not because the Bible says so. It can be shown to be
good through other methods of reason. The same cannot be said for being
baptized, for example.


I don't think you can accept conclusions of a philosophy that is based on
premises that you disagree with. There is no foundation to support your
conclusion!

But I see that happening in today's religions. People want to hang on to the
tradition, to the good feelings, to prayers, to loving one another, to going to
church every week, etc. They want to hold on to the idea of Jesus being god,
and saving us, etc. But they want to dismiss the very things that build up that
myth to begin with.

Who is Jesus, if not the man described in the Bible? And who is that, if not
for belief in the Old Testament and its laws? And what is that, if not for
belief in Yahweh? I mean, you can't just start at Jesus, because he cannot
exist without first accepting a whole line of other arguments and truths.

At least, that's how I see it.

And so, the same goes for Judaism and Islam, of course. And hell, throw in
Mormonism, too. ;)

FUNNY THING:

Galileo was not, strictly speaking, persecuted for advocating heliocentric
theories.

He was persecuted for saying that they were not theories, but truths.

Copernicus had earlier presented the heliocentric theory as a useful model for
explaining the perceived motion of the planets; however, he suffered no
persecution.

Galileo, however, turned a theoretical, model-of-the-universe claim into a
truth claim.  And the Church had a problem with that; they thought the only
absolute truths were the ones arrived at by logical argument or by revelation,
or better still, a harmonious combination of both, such as was found in Thomas
Aquinas.

Mere empirical observation could not, as JL said, count as a truth claim.

So the people who persecuted Galileo were firmly in JL's camp!

Copernicus was fully aware that his heliocentric model would rouse the ire of

to publish "De revolutionibus orbium". The editor of this book, Osiander, added
a forward disclaiming the heliocentric theory as merely a calculational device.

It was Kepler, publishing "Astronomia Nova" in 1609 who demonstrated
conclusively that all the planets revolve aroound the sun in elliptical orbits.
Only Kepler's system provided calculations that were better than the ancient
Ptolemaic system. The Catholic Church responded with the Edict of 1616:

""The view that the sun stands motionless at the center of the universe is
foolish, philosophically false, utterly heretical, because contrary to Holy

I don't think he's saying that animism had an insight into matter and energy
the way you think he's saying it. He's talking about processes. He's not saying
that when everybody back in the day said "spirit" they meant "energy", so see,
it's just like science! Let me reveal some of my vaguely formed thoughts, and
see if that helps the situation any.

I've been looking into Shinto lately. Usually when Shinto stuff gets
translated, they leave the word kami alone, though some people might translate
it as "gods". But the kami aren't really gods, and the site I saw used
etymology as an illustration. Kami often got defined as high, that's apparently
a mistake because of a homophone, but of course, it fits this notion we ahve
that gods are superior.

Apparently what kami actually means is something like, hidden, or something
that's been concealed. The examples given are the life-giving power of rice, or
the hidden source of a river. Now, you might say, we don't have hidden river
sources, we know about the water cycle and all. But even then, it's a process
that's largely hidden from us. Or take digestion Etc., i.e. all that goes into
the life-giving power of rice. Again, these are largely hidden processes.

So I think what he's saying, and it helps if you look at some of his other
posts on animism, is something like this. Science has largely been concerned
with mechanistic views of the universe. Our bodies are "biological machines",
our brains are "computers", there's us and then there's everything else we can
manipulate and impose our will on. But now from science, and largely because
we're looking at things in terms of energy rather than chunks of matter ala
billiard balls, we're seeing more and more talk of processes.

Hey guess what? Animism has been talking about processes all the live long day.
Does that mean those processes are the same as science's processes? No, any
more than the Greek atom is the same as the modern picture of the atom. But we
shouldn't scorn Democritus' apparently correct insight "atoms and the void, and
nothing else", just because he wasn't all modern sciency in the way he arrived
at it. It's also possible we might want to revisit that stuff, instead of
dismissing it as a historical curiosity, e.g. somebody intuitively came up with
something close to our modern picture of the universe, but that's it. Ditto
with animism, it might have something to tell us.

And I further think that what he's suggesting is that the conception we've had
of the body is this sort of vehicle our minds pilot around in this external
world,again an external world that's just a bunch of dead stuff we impose our
will on. But animism says that if you stop and think about it, there's all
these processes. Processes "in your body", processes "outside your body",
processes you have no influence over, processes you can interact with, Etc. But
if you think of it in terms of processes, i.e. it's all processes, then we
really have this interacting network of processes. Isn't that something like
some pictures of quantum stuff, where everything's connected?

Again, I don't think either of us are suggesting that animists would stop a
scientist explaining QM or relativity mid spate and just be like "yeah dude,
we've been saying that for 3000 years, welcome to the damn party. Finally!" I
think we're just saying that if you look at animist societies, they're way into
processes and interactions, not a separate you blundering around in a haunted
house external world, the world's all processes too, it's all interactions. And
when you consider science from the standpoint of "energy" rather than "matter",
ala QM which seems to be the big place you see this, you get similar kinds of
things going on.

There, I hope that's way less obnoxious than before. But if that's still
obnoxious, oh well, I guess I'm obnoxious, because I see his point. It
certainly won't be the first time I've been considered obnoxious.

power of these hidden processes. So for me personally, and this is slightly off
the subject of animism but not really, one thing that does for me is give me a
greater appreciation of all of that. The sun really DOES give us life, thunder
really DOES give us life, water, food, Etc. I guess I don't see anything

I realized, even before I read today's comments, that I should have added that
the stuff about animism being process-oriented was really interesting, and a
useful insight completely separate from mass-energy equivalence. But you all
have slammed that point intho the ground now. Thank you. ;)

I still think that comparing the processes of animism to QM is a category
error; they look completely unalike, and ARE completely unalike in the way they
work. The only reason we are tempted to unify them is that there's a surface
equivalence, or that we only have so many cognitive frames to go around, or
that we really want to. And with that difference at the fundamental level, I
question whether it's an insight on the same level--that is, serving the same
function--as mass-energy equivalence or what have you. Similarly, Democritus'
reasoning and "insight" as it were into the atom is no longer all that
relevant.

I wonder if, on the scientific truth level, stuff like animism's understanding
of processes works best as a metaphor that can guide insights. To go to
Democritus, maybe John Dalton would have been less ready to coin atomic theory
if he hadn't heard of Democritus' idea first. If animism helps some physicist
derive new ideas about QM, that doesn't mean that animism is "right," but that
any source of fertile metaphor is useful in the creative act.

Arguably, our everyday understanding of matter isn't "right" either by
QM standards.  Or even by pre-QM atomic theory standards.  We think of
things as continuous substances which are largely empty space, studded
with charged particles in a latticework of electromagnetic relations.
We think of things as objects which are not essentially discontinuous
with their environment (being merely different arrangements of the
same building blocks).  We think of those objects as having inherent
properties, like "color," which exist only in terms of their
interaction with our organism.  By God, we think of ourselves as
"selves," and there's nothing vaugely like that in physics.

We live in a wildly inaccurate perceptual and conceptual world, by the
standards of any reasonable physics.

Getting snippy about somebody else's perceptual and conceptual world
because it's merely "metaphorically" closer to QM, when ours is not
even close in that metaphorical way, seems perverse to me.

It seems like insisting that before one approach QM reality, one must
pass through our ordinary reality, because our ordinary reality is
"really real" and theirs isn't, despite the fact that neither of our
realities resembles the reality revealed by advanced physics.

"First they've got to get over that wacky 'world is process and
energy' shit,and absorb our 'world is objects and entities' real
world, and then from there proceed to the 'world is process and

I'm saying that physics most assuredly does _not_ show us a world more

consonant with neither all that much.

But the article relies on a fairly naive understanding of what mass-energy
equivalence means, and uses that to suggest an equivalence between the
scientific perspective and the animism perspective which is pretty well
unjustified. That the animist view is much more sophisticated than "simple
projections of souls and spirits" is a good point and well-taken, but it is
fundamentally not talking about the same thing as physics.

looks exceedingly different from what Democritus envisioned, and if you even
drop a couple levels to quarks and leptons they don't seem to work in quite the

I would also venture to say that Spirit as animating force is probably further

I really get the impression that you think the author meant something like
this.

Mass and energy are equivalent. So instead of talking about hunks of matter
bumping into each other, physics is talking about energy interactions. Animism
doesn't talk about hunks of matter either, it talks about interactions. So you
see when a Hopi talks about ... they're really talking about quantum
entanglement! It's right there!

I think what we're all saying is something more like this. Physics for a long
time has talked about interacting chunks of matter. But we know matter and
energy are equivalent, and because of that, it's talking about interacting
processes a lot more. Animism, properly understood,  has been talking about
nothing BUT interacting processes since forever. So we might be able to get
some insights there.

It's weird, on the one hand, you're saying exactly that, you're going "well
yeah I can see it, if animism's process talk helps somebody just like
Democritus' atom helped Dalton then ..." But OTOH, you have this really
vehement need to explain to us that Democritus' atom and animisms are really
bullshit, let's not get above ourselves and think Democritus actually had some
sort of REAL insight, because science's atom is SO WAY different, you guys,
seriously, OMG!

I kind of wonder where that comes from? It's like there's this underlying fear
that if we admit that Democritus had something, if not totally consonant with
our modern picture, at least fairly along the right track, or if we can pretty
much fit say, an egg creation myth to the big bang, that we'll all just say "oh
OK, fuck science then" and all go live in some crazed mythworld and set back
human progress three thousand years. I don't think anybody's saying "hey we can
throw out  all those QM books now, Democritus had it right all along"! I think
we're just saying, "you know, he kind of did have something there". Maybe some
of us are adding, I am anyway but I don't want to speak for anybody else, "if
we've got atoms or processes or whatever from the old stuff, and that fits our
modern scientific picture without doing much, if any, violence to either, then
maybe we can get some insights from the old stuff, maybe we can look to it as a
source of spiritual guidance that doesn't conflict with modern science", Etc.
You seem to want to insist that, "no no no, see it really DOES conflict, that's

You're right, I think there's a little of this. I think it's in the language
that animists have "known" this about the world, which implies that they _did_
have some unique insight into the nature of high-energy physics or what have
you.

That said, I'm not sure even your interpretation works very well. That is, the
problem is this:
"I think what we're all saying is something more like this. Physics for a long

I'm not sure this is true at all--and _especially_ not true where mass-energy
equivalence works as a stand-in for verbs instead of nouns, or what have you.
And that's what I'm throwing out there as a danger. There is a widespread
tendency to try to show that various belief systems have something to offer the
world because if you look at them crooked they kinda sorta match up with
scientific explanations of the world. It's a tendency I find, well, obnoxious.

As for valuable insights, I think those are more likely to happen when the
connection is a bit closer. I'm not denying they exist, especially in
metaphysics as compared to physics, but I think in this case the magisteria
don't overlap very well.

So your argument is that you don't think science is talking about processes?
I'm kind of confused on what you find so obnoxious, frankly. I'm not trying to

and you'd damn well better recognize that, punk"! I mean, it just looks like
defending science's territory.

Let me pick another religion and maybe give a flavor of what I mean. Because I
think you're tying "insights" to science, like you think I want to use animism
or the atoms of Democritus to solve some current issue, like I think a
scientist will go "dude we're trying to solve this low temperature
superconductor problem right? Well I was totally thinking about the sharing
process of the Kwakiutl potlatch ceremony and ...." I'm not saying that at all.
I'm saying something a lot more like this.

Suddenly Master Lai grew ill. Gasping and wheezing, he lay at the point of
death. His wife and children gathered round in a circle and began to cry.
Master
Li, who had come to ask how he was, said, "Shoo! Get back! Don't disturb the
process of change!"

Then he leaned against the doorway and talked to Master Lai. "How marvelous the
Creator is! What is he going to make of you next? Where is he going to
send you? Will he make you into a rat's liver? Will he make you into a bug's
arm?"

Master Lai said, "A child, obeying his father and mother, goes wherever he is
told, east or west, south or north. And the yin and yang - how much more
are they to a man than father or mother! Now that they have brought me to the
verge of death, if I should refuse to obey them, how perverse I would be!
What fault is it of theirs? The Great Clod burdens me with form, labors me with
life, eases me in old age, and rests me in death. So if I think well of
my life, for the same reason I must think well of my death. When a skilled
smith is casting metal, if the metal should leap up and say, `I insist upon
being made into a Mo-yeh!' 17 he would surely regard it as very inauspicious
metal indeed. Now, having had the audacity to take on human form once, if
I should say, `I don't want to be anything but a man! Nothing but a man!', the
Creator would surely regard me as a most inauspicious sort of person. So
now I think of heaven and earth as a great furnace, and the Creator as a
skilled smith. Where could he send me that would not be all right? I will go
off
to sleep peacefully, and then with a start I will wake up."
  Chuang-Tsu, Ch. 6, Tr. Burton Watson

Now I don't think that when I say this accords with modern science, I'm looking
at it "sort of crooked" at all. We now "know", and I mean that in terms of
science, that the elements that make us up are just transformed when we die,
whatever you consider them to be, physical stuff, energy, Etc. Now I guess you
can look at this and go "ah ha, he's talking mystical reincarnation bullshit"!
But I look at it and go "hey, he's talking recycling, just like modern
science". So yeah, in that sense, I guess I AM saying Chuang-Tsu KNEW
something. I don't know that I'd say we DIDN'T know it, though it hasn't been
talked about in Western stuff a ton that I'm aware of. And I don't see too many
people using science to come up with that sort of philosophical insight.

I haven't thought about this in terms of animism and what the original post was
talking about enough to give an example like that for the specific case, though
I tried to come close with my comments on the kami. But I'm sorry, I don't
think I'm looking at either science or religion "sort of crooked" to "make them
fit". It seems pretty direct to me, that we've got similar concepts under
discussion. Sure, Chuang-Tsu isn't going to talk about which chemical elements
make up our body, and the process of decomposition, and ... But barring that, I
really don't see much difference.

I beg to differ. It's not about time, as such. It's about cause. You have the

what caused those conditions"? If you don't, then you admit they were
causeless, they always existed until they didn't anymore. That's basically the
same thing people are saying with God, except for the part about not existing
anymore. See, when you go "where'd God come from?", you want a cause for God.

Fine, I want a cause for the big bang conditions. Saying they just were is no
more an answer than saying God just was. If you're going to argue that God
can't be 1, i.e. Faunus' natural number defined as not a successor, then you
need a different argument than "saying God just existed isn't an answer",
because you're doing the same with the big bang conditions or quantum vacuum or
whatever we think it might have been this week. Maybe your argument is "God's
too complicated to have been a first cause", fine, we could debate that if you
want. But saying God needs a cause can't be it, because that applies, as I've

A lot of philosophers have argued about exactly what the hell
"causation" is.

I think the Brits -- Hobbes, Locke, Hume, and Mill -- did a lot to try
to narrow it down, as to just what an empirical scientist can mean by
"cause."

Kant thought causation was one of the concepts that were built into
our minds, ones we couldn't help thinking with.

He's probably right at least as far as this, JL: you really can't
avoid thinking in terms of causation, whatever the hell it is.

I find this to be a very strange statement because a model is a sort of

What I usually object to is when people turn spirituality into something
physical, or as a model which really *can* be tested and falsified, but they
refuse to think of it like that.

For example, perhaps a person believes they can talk to dogs and understand
what they are communicating. Well, that would be cool. So we could devise some
tests to see if that is really happening. And if you fail the test, then it's
probably not really real, is it? But people still want to believe it anyway.

It's not that I don't think science is talking about processes. I just don't
think that the fact mass-energy equivalence exists means that science is
suddenly talking about processes where it wasn't before. Same for QM. Talking

into one's pre-existing ideas about the world.

Re: the story of Master Lai

I agree that this is an insight that science has verified. I don't really have
a fundamental problem with that. I think this is a categorically different
question from the borrowing of QM--just the nature of the stories told, and the
concepts compared.

You wrote:

"And I don't see too many

I'm not sure whether this is true or not, but that's what I find really

provide further philosophical insights. That's why I don't think I'm defending
science slavishly here; I think merely that the one article in question made a
naive mistake that is unfortunately repeated by a lot of people. I don't mean

I don't know, I do an okay job of it. I'm kind of okay with thinking of
"causation" as being states of a subset of the universe, such that the state of
any other part of the universe would not have any influence on whether the
second state followed the first.

In that case, the first state "caused" the second.

But not really, of course. They are just two different states of a continuum.
A vast, complex game of billiards balls bouncing around against each other
started ages ago.

One event causes another no more than 12:00am causes 12:01am.

You cannot isolate any event or thing from the rest of the universe, and say
that it was the cause of something else. Every part of the universe had an
impact, for all of time. The butterfly effect is in everything. You cannot
divorce anything from the rest of the universe and say that it caused something
else. It is one.

Yeah. If we accept something like Giraffe's definition, then I'd be happy to
call it an analogy. Because Giraffe's definition encompasses the idea that ...
I'm not sure how to express this. That these are real processes we're talking
about. I get the sense that when JL says "analogy", and I could be wrong here,
he means it in the same sense he means "myth" or "story", a pretty way to
explain things to ourselves, but more or less inaccurate, and hence, we should
ultimately strive to abandon it.

Let me try to explain it this way. I don't hold my spirituality to be
exclusivist. Suppose I play flute for twenty minutes, and get into a meditative
state. Are there other things that can do that? Sure. Hell water can probably
do it faster than flute. I'm sure science has drugs that can do it even faster.
So I'm not looking at it going "ah ha, flute makes you meditate, that's the
only thing that does it, everybody learn flute"! I look at it as, "being
exposed to flute in this way has helped me/given me insights, being exposed to
Shinto has helped/given me insights", Etc. Sure, there might be lots of other
things that do that. I could study soil biology for five years and come to the
same insight I posted from Zhuangzi (Chuang-Tsu) earlier today. But I didn't. I
got it from Zhuangzi.

And I think, to return to Step.'s nightmare that people might have known stuff
back in the day :), it's not so much that they knew stuff we didn't. Maybe it's
that they've considered it. Let me give an admittedly incredibly crude example.
You see these futurist people. And they'll go "ooo ... what if we make a real
AI, is it conscious then? Oooo ... what if we upload our minds on to hard
drives, is that consciousness then?" I'm sure we've considered this stuff at
points in Western philosophy before. But animisms have considered it a lot, and
for some of them anyway, the idea seems to be, well it presents like a person,
sure, it's a person. Or to put it another way that doesn't sound quite so much
like "if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck", what I think they're
saying is, we can have the same kinds of interactions with X that we can have
with Bob. Bob's a person, X is a person.

But I mean, you get people looking at this "futurist" stuff, and they act like
it's all new and shiny andsciency because it's got robots and AIs and neural
networks and copied minds and OMG! It's so awesome and future, NONE of that
stuff exists yet! And I'm just looking at it and going, yeah, you know what
that sounds like? That sounds like people interacting with embodied spirits
from animist cultures, that's what that sounds like to me.

So I guess what I'm saying is, yeah, there are some real senses in which
science is talking about some stuff now, and I'm not saying it's all of science
or even that it's super mainstream, just that you know it's accepted as
sciency, as possible, and not some sort of whacked out craziness, but it's
talking about some stuff animisms, among other things, have been talking about
for quite a while now.

I guess what I'm driving at is that I think my spirituality is talking about
the "real world" or at least possibilities in that world. But it's far less
connected to science than it seems here. The only connection I make with
science, usually, is that something fits in a scientific worldview, see my
comments on the kami, so I can talk about kami or whatever and not be
contradicting something science is saying. i'm saying something different than
science really, or maybe, relating to the things science relates to in a
different way. But when I talk about the water cycle as the ultimate hidden
source of a river, I'm not suggesting that the ancient Japanese had a thorough
understanding of the water cycle, though they probably understood a good chunk
of it. I'm saying that even though we can explain a lot more about those
processes that ultimately give us life, they're still largely hidden from our
everyday experience, and we don't really think of them in that way, as the
processes that literally give us life, and have an appreciation of them in that
sense.

another?

I think that's the kind of stuff he's driving at with the thing about looking
at the universe based on energy, you lose that separate little self-contained
objects knocking into each other, i.e. affecting each other only externally.
Now we're talking a lot more about interacting fields and levels of energy
instead of the old style planet models with electron shells ... so to use a
crude analogy, I can think of it a lot more like, here's what I'm like when I'm
walking, here's what I'm like when I'm running, as far as "levels" where the
electrons reside. The old models implied that each set of electrons was on its
own little track, a set of little balls we set rolling in their own little
circular area.

I think he's trying, maybe not very well, to get further philosophical insights
from it all. QM tells us we're dealing with fields and entangled things and ...
animism, and again see his rhizome post, says the same thing, we're not just
these individual skin-covered meat things walking around that migt happen to
bump into each other now and again. Everything's a lot more like entangled
plants, some more than others, networks if you will, to use a current buzzword.

Here's a question BTW. How do you tell "I'm coopting science to give my
spiritual conceptions some awesome cred they probably don't deserve" from "I'm
saying, these spiritual conceptions fit into a scientific world"? Is it whether
or not we think the older spiritual things have something to say to science?
Because I gotta say, feeling they fit but that the  fit oges only one way,
science is the big dog and it lets the little dogs snuggle up to it out of its
magnanimity seems pretty weird. If they fit, if the're talking about similar
things, then I'd expect nothing less than to be able to have the fit
spirituality inform science from time to time.

1) Why is it not possible to think that the ultimate reality, the one, exists
as something quantized? I mean, fundamentally. I see no problem.

2) I don't think my view on QM is unscientific, as I have read scientists
discussing similar views. But I don't pretend to be a QM expert.

3) I'm fine with God as first cause. I'm happy to label that my "God" too. It's
when people derive conclusions from it that I start to object. I have no issue
with giving the label "God" to anything. In fact, I tend to give the label
"God" to everything which seems to be fundamentally outside our cone of
observation and understanding. I have a sense of awe and humility and

Well, if the guy had you writing for him, he might have done a lot better. :) I
don't think, if that was his intent, he communicated it well at all. And I do
think he doesn't understand the science all that well, which makes it more
noxious. (If he does understand it, he sure ain't showing it.)

You asked:
"How do you tell "I'm coopting science to give my
spiritual conceptions some awesome cred they probably don't deserve" from "I'm
saying, these spiritual conceptions fit into a scientific world"?"

For me, it's whether the person a) actually understands the science, and b) is
able to draw a close enough correspondence that there is useful interplay. This
isn't spirituality, but kind of the same thing: Democritus' ideas of atoms was
really useful in helping John Dalton conceptualize atomic theory. I think a
spiritual model could easily do the same thing, especially as physics gets
weirder and weirder: it might help someone find an overarching model for some
data.

Well the basic question is something like, why is what I'm saying way less
obnoxious, when I am pretty much saying there are things we don't "know"? But
what I mean is, maybe we don't "know" them in the sense that we've kind of
played with them a bit and then abandoned them, while other cultures took them
and ran with them? How do you distinguish that, which you seem to approve of at
least to an extent, from Deepak Chopra? Especially since, being a doctor, he
should understand at least SOME of the science way better than I do?

But to take a wider scope, what I'm trying to figure out is, well we want
spiritualities that fit with science, right? I mean, we want more scientific
literacy and all that, but we don't want to abandon spiritual insights, for
lack of a better word. And I think we need spirituality, because science has
sort of given up on philosophy and all, it's more like "yeah we found out thing
X about the universe", but very few scientists, that I've seen, have been
trying to say something like, "and here's what this might mean to you". Though
it might be coming back to an extent, I don't know. But by and large, it's just
sort of, here's science and it's figuring out what goes on in the universe
you're living in, that's it.

There's no, to sound like an Objectivist for a minute, gods forbid,
integration. We're just sort of getting "we found out the brain does this
today,  and the atom does that, and this experiment told us people act like so
but this other one says they act like that and ..." You see? So we want kind of
a framework for our lives, if that's the sort of thing people want, maybe some
of them don't, but some do. So we want them to have, as much as possible, one
that fits with science, right? So how do you distinguish, "I'm trying to make
this fit with science" the good way from "I'm trying to make this fit with
science because people totally buy anything science says, so if I can connect
my bullshit with science, I've got it made"!

I kind of see the marriage between spirituality and science like this...

Spirit: Praying does miracles! I believe that there is power in prayer. It can
heal ailments and help people get better.

Science: Well, hold on. There is no link that we can find. But we did tests,
and we found that prayer is like meditation, and it really helps people relax,
and the positivity of knowing you're being prayed for really does help people.
There is more to this, such as the ability for the mind to influence the body,
and prayer is just one way to plug into this.


Spirituality [Bad]: NO! Prayer heals! Our god says so. You can't tell us
otherwise, because my cousin's son Timmy had his cancer cured after a prayer
vigil! That's all the proof I need!

Spirituality [Good]: Ah, it is indeed subtle. There is more going on that
science can explain at the moment, but we knew there must be something to this
long-held tradition. Now we know it's not exactly as we though, but it still
has value in it for some people.


Science [Bad]: NO! You are idiots! Praying is stupid! There is no causal link!
There is no way prayer could change people! We should let everyone know how
dumb they are, and abandon prayer forever.

Science [Good]: Ah, it is indeed subtle. We don't have all the answers yet, and
clearly this ancient tradition has found a way to access the benefits of the
mind-body connection in a way that we have not yet figured out. Perhaps we will
understand it better with time.

I think there are two nice ways in which spirituality and science can work
together:

1) An insight understood through spiritual story can turn out to be true in
some scientifically understood way;
2) Some scientific truth can be mediated through spirituality in order to
become more relevant to human experience and to help us gain further insight to
human experience.
There may be more, of course, but those two are most on the table.

Now, #1 is seductive to lots of people, like Chopra, because people regard
scientifically derived truths to be more likely to be true than spiritually
derived truths, at least in this culture. So they sometimes stretch their
metaphors really, painfully far in order to make it work. Master Lai is a #1
story, but it works, probably because the scientific concept being tied to (the
durability of atoms) really isn't all that technical. One key, though, is that
you have to get the science right, and if you don't, the whole thing falls
apart--which is why I complained about that kinetic animism piece, which really
doesn't get the science right. But even if it does, sometimes the metaphor can
be just too finely stretched to make one feel that the insights are legitimate;
it's more of a feel thing than anything concrete.

Really, though, #1 is kind of boring on its own, right? I mean, does it really
enhance the Master Lai story that it has some scientific provenance? And aren't
there spiritual stories that are utterly nonscientific yet extremely relevant
to our experience as humans? To my mind, these stories need to stand on their
own merits; the only way they have anything to offer a scientific worldview is
if they allow someone to model further scientific ideas, which I haven't really
seen yet.

#2 is much more interesting, but more obviously so, so I won't talk about it as
much. Suffice it to say that the idea of spirituality that incorporates
scientific stories and applies it to our existence is intriguing in theory. In
fact, of course, it becomes Scientology.

Step:

OK, can you explain a bit more about how/where you think the kenetic animism
thing got the science wrong? I guess in particular I'd say also look at his
previous post, the rhizome one, and also realize that the majority of the
kenetic post, the stuff about Chinese cosmology, is a quote from somebody else.
I'm asking because clearly you'd choose my final explanation of animism and
science, but for me, that pretty much came right out of what he said, the main
author, not Chinese cosmology guy.

I'm asking because I'm trying to do what I've been talking about. I mean, I
think JL and I could easily argue, because I'm prepared to take my experiences
as they come. To return to my futurist thing, I'd largely agree with the
animists that if it appears as a person and you can interact with it as a
person, it's a person. Where I'm willing to be expansive though is that I
ultimately don't care whether SCIENCE thinks it's a person. So to take the
Ojibwe, suppose I interact with one of the thunder beings? What I'd say is if
that interaction is meaningful, and it doesn't screw me up, that is, I can
function as a human being in society, then I'm going to continue to say "I
interacted with a thunder being yesterday", even if science insists it was some
aspect of my mind or whatever. But I don't have a problem, as such, with
science saying it's an aspect of my mind, so long as science let's me get on
with it.

I sort of lied to JL a bit too. I do sort of do predictions, but not about the
world as such. But I've been saying for years that you can be a tool. If you
think, Buddhist meditation let's say, sounds like it will do something useful
for you, try it. Try it properly of course, but give it a try. The Buddha
pretty much said this too. So if say, I read something from a shamanic
tradition, and I try it, and I start to get the effects it's talking about, or
something that looks like it's headed in that direction because some of this
stuff can take years of course, then I continue. But just like learning to play
an instrument, I can't do it all at once. That's why I say if it looks like
it's headed in that direction.

So I mean, with that in mind, I really think we should, as much as possible,
have spiritualities that fit within a modern scientific worldview. So I'm
trying to figure out how best to communicate that sort of thing. I've seen the
people you describe, I often criticize them for much the same thing. But I
didn't see this author pulling a Chopra or such, and clearly you did. So I'm
trying to figure out why, so I can talk about this stuff more clearly. If I'm
going to be obnoxious or aggravate people, I generally like to do it on
purpose, rather than accidentally.

OK, well, I saw the ad. Yeah, I get the sex connection, though it kind of does
really get broken on a lot of places. But I see the implications. My religion
says, sex is a part of life, deal with it.

As for the Catholic guy, I see we're back to "THINK OF THE CHILDREN!!!!!!"
again. Hey you know what? I do think of the children. And here's what I think.
I think of growing up in the eighties, when people would tell my mom she had to
watch out for me because I played DND and listened to Metallica, and they were
the gateways to drugs and Satan and suicide and ... Being a kid who thought
about stuff, here's what I've worked out. I'm hardly the first to have said
this, it's come up from a couple comedians, but I think it's pretty apt.

Suppose you're listening to a song, and it said "go get a knife from the
kitchen, and stab it through the palm of your hand". Would you do it? Would you
expect most teenagers to do it? I'm going to guess the answer to both of those
is no. I'm guessing if your friend walked up to you and said "hey man, I saw
this movie, and I've decided we need to kill my parents, come help me out",
you'd go "no way dude, what the hell's wrong with you"? I guess my point is, if
kids are raised with values, they'll tend to apply those values. Sure, there
are probably SOME cases where kids see something totally crazy and go "tht
looks like a great idea"! But I'm betting every single one of us can come up
with some sick twisted thing that most people would look at and go, "dude, no
way, why the hell would you do that"?

That's why I say, I don't care if you agree with this supposed hedonistic
culture, and I don't really care what you want your kids exposed to. It's YOUR
job to figure out what YOUR kids should and shouldn't be exposed to, not mine.
I'm not saying that means you never take it into account or show cursing in the
middle of the afternoon or something. I'm just saying, if your kids are old
enough to understand what the ad's implying, then they're old enough for you to
have given them some values about that kind of thing, and hopefully to have
discussed actual strategies to make decisions when things that could be bad for
them come up.

To return to music for a moment, here's one of the best quotes I've ever seen,
from somebody on a bbs, an actual dialup bbs, years ago. "If a teenager plays
chess and listens to Barry Manilow and kills himself, people will say, '"ohthat
poor kid, he must have had a lot of problems in his life, OMG, what happened?'
If a teenager plays DND and listens to Metallica and kills himself, people will
say 'that damn devil music and those damn games made him kill himself!'" Your
kids will get exposed to bad influences at some point, and I mean REALLY bad
influences, not something we can debate till next year like seeing a half naked
woman on TV. If you're not giving them the abilities, logical, spiritual, Etc.
they need to make decisions, I don't care how much hedonistic leftist cultural
bullshit you've protected them from, they're probably going to make some bad
decisions when it really counts.

That's what MY religious values tell me. MY religious values tell me to try to
look at things and figure out if they ACTUALLY hurt people, and if not, then as
uncomfortable as I may be with it, it's probably not my place to yell at peopl
and say they're wrong or they shouldn't do that or whatever. And I'm sorry, I
don't think this ad's ANYWHERE near that. So much for "many religions".

killed herself, she had, you know, actual problems, like maybe depression over
the death of her uncle, that made her do that. It wasn't that she got exposed

far as I can tell, it doesn't say that anywhere in the ad. It seems like

just get distracted by a bunch of other shit. Today, sicne I'm tryign to keep
awake, I was looking on the net, came across Jung's "Seven Sermons to the
Dead", read that, looked up Abraxas, chased down abracadabra, that reminded me
I wanted to look up ankh on Wikipedia .... you see what I'm driving at here.

I've got lower back pain now and again. I know stretches that actually really
help. Do I do them? Your damn right I don't! Half the time I get up and just
get going with stuff, because I figure I've been in bed long enough already,
they take a bit of time to do, and I figure I should just get up and going.
Then I don't get back to them later either, see previous paragraph. I should
probably just do them every day or so, whether I have pain or not. But I
totally don't. So I guess the upshot is, find out how you effectively develop
any kind of good habbit, and that should do it.

It's tough though. Hell, I've always had a good connection to water. I don't
think I thought about it quite in such explicit terms, but I really like
Shinto's waterfall purification rite, and some priests will say, do it in a
shower if you can't get to a waterfall. I have no idea if they mean a cold
shower, I've seen conflicting stuff, so I just incorporated the idea more
explicitly in my normal shower. You know, just kind of being more focused on
that aspect of cleaning/purification, the spiritual connection as well as

Do I still keep doing that? Nope. Probably because I didn't pay enough
attention to do it long enough to get it as a habbit in my brain. So I mean,
I'm not even doing the super easy stuff that's all internal thought and in fact

You know, I'm not trying to be skeptical, or racist for that matter, but I find
stuff like this fascinating.

http://www.entheosound.com/enthfrnt.htm

First of all, it's disappointing that entheosound.com only references one kind
of (supposedly) sacred sound thing. I use sacred for lack of a better word,
we're talking about instruments that put you in touch with gods/spirits/the
divine/what have you. But that's just personally disappointing to me. Here's
the real problem. Somebody, presumably Don Wright, opines:

They stopped producing their vessels when conquistadors entered their land.
They did not share the vessel experience with the invaders. For hundreds of
years the vessels have remained silent, waiting for this point in history to
reawaken.

Really, guy with one of the whitest names I've ever seen? So tell me, if the
various cultures of Peru didn't "share the vessel experience with the
invaders", and they've "remained silent" for "hundreds of years", how is it
that they suddenly up and decided to share it all with you? Here's another site
on these things, still no sound though.

http://www.peruvianvessels.com/

Why oh why must these people write in a bunch of gibberish? One of the best
things I've seen about sound in a sort of new age context is that singing bowls
"stop your inner dialogue", I find this to be pretty accurate for me. However
there's not a lot of info on singing bowls getting used as sound producing
instruments. But that's fine, it works. But for these things, we're opening up
some sort of crazy new awareness, it's relaxing and regenerating but also
empowering, rauk aun!, and a bunch of other buzzwords.

Me, I'm with the singing bowl people. I get stopping my inner dialogue. Singing
bowls focus me pretty quick. Of course, a bunch of other things do too, I can
get the same effect from minimalist drone music, but then, I don't think
singing bowls have to be something crazy unique to be meaningful or useful.
They're neat, and they work. Back to the whistling vessels, let's take a break
from white guy financial exploitation, sort of, and hear what they sound like,
as far as I can tell.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lUkhwNc45Q

Why imagine that, they sound like lots of other pre-Columbian flutes, most
notably some double flutes from Mexico, usually also clay/ceramic. I haven't
found one of those yet, but I'll bet I can get one for less than $900, the
price of Don Wright's cheapest set of whistling vessels.

False again..... God revealed his presence to the Jewish, chosen people, to
Moses on Mt. Sinai through the Ten Commandments. God is real and a palpable
presence in our lives. The universe does not make sense without God.


Why's the universe gotta make sense? Who needs a definite answer? I don't. I'm
content to live with unknowns. I don't need the "certainty" of some almost
certainly made-up religion for comfort. I'd rather have the honestness of
knowing that I *don't* know. At least that is real.

I was listening to one of Alan Watts' speaches on youtube and he goes on about
how the Christian god was modeled on human kings of the day. That's why one
bows and prostrates oneself before the "lord."

Here's what I find interesting about arguments like Capa's "God was modeled on
ancient kings". The implication goes something like this. "See, we totally
don't have ancient kings anymore, so that doesn't make sense, but also, we now
know EXACTLY where and why God got the character God has, that means there's no
God".

So let's see here. Can we extend this argument? If we now talk about brains in
terms of computers, and fifty years from now we find out they're NOTHING like
that, well we know that now I think but you get my point, does that mean that
the thing we were studying doesn't exist? I don't so much mean the physical
brain, though we could go there too. But I mean, look at pretty much ANYTHING
in the history of science. Our metaphors have changed quite a lot. We used to
love the fuck out of clockwork. Now, not so much. Now it's computers, or we
apply biological evolution to everything as the metaphor for understanding, say
paradigm, if you like that better, but I'm saying metaphor because that's
really what it is.

When you take biological evolution and go "let's see what happens if we apply
it to the stock market", that's pretty much the same thing as "I'll bet the
rest of the universe is set up like our government, with a ruler and all". So
now this ties us into Jl's point. Jl's back to his, stories are OK I guess if
you're a primitive feeb, but we're totally rocketing to the stars baby! Sure, I
could be nicer about it, but that's basically Jl's position, at bottom. And my
point here is the same point I and others made about stories and myths a while
back. YOU CAN'T HELP IT! Brain == computer, stock market == biological
evolution, ALL of that is an understanding conditioned by environment, just as
much as God == king. They're just as much stories you're telling yourself as
any myth you care to name.

Now of course, somebody will jump on the "but one's way more USEFUL than the
other" bandwagon, but that's really a different argument. Right now I'm just
attacking the idea that God == ancient king, so screw God, because that's
pretty much the argument that was given. And it seems to me that this argument
does a couple of really problematic things.

  1. In the form phrased, it's pretty much pure prejudice. THOSE people took
their government and applied it to the universe, how silly. WE don't do stuff
like that.

2. If we use the argument as given, we then need to reject ALL such
understandings. Wave buh bye to applying evolution to the stock market,
computers to the brain, Etc.

I guess if that's what you're after, go for it. I always get the sneaking
suspicion that people just fail to understand the implications of what they're
saying though.

Sure, I'd agree with that. I just think the arguments often used to attack that

previous post. It's like we need to have this group of elite smart people,
guess who's in that one, and a group of idiots who've barely figured out
breathing or something. Let's step back from religion for a minute.

My fiance's mom posted something on FB during the elections about how all
Republicans are idiots, basically. I took her to task for it because, really,
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Are there Republicans so trapped in their
narrow "abortion is the only thing that matters" worldview that they make
stupid comments about legitimate rape? Sure. So I mean, there are Republicans
who really don't get women's issues. If we expand that, there are some who
think things worked fine back in the whenever, and why are we changing it all?

I'd respond that things are changing, and I absolutely think we should deal
with that change, e.g. going back to the economic model of the 50s where a man
worked and earned enough money to support a family probably isn't going to work
anymore, due to changes in the economy. But does the fact that they want things
to work the way they've seen them work all these years make them stupid people?
Does the idea that you should work really hard instead of getting money from
the government make the unintelligent? Mind you, I'm not saying I agree with
any of those things. I'm just saying, they're not inherently idiotic, just
because they hold those ideas. There are nuances within those ideas, and if we
can get to those, we might find agreement, e.g. both Pecc. and I agree with
you, the Judeo-Christian god ain't the end all be all of anything accept
Judaism and Christianity, maybe.

Gwynn, there are many things wrong with the assertion that "Gods are like

arguments you bring up are among them.

What someone is saying with the "god==king" comparison is comparing two
hypotheses: "Ancient kings and gods were treated in the same way by random
chance," or "ancient kings and gods were treated in the same way because they
were modeled after one another."

You can't draw an equivalent argument for evolution==market or brain==computer,
because there are real things on both sides of the equation--you're just trying
to figure out how each works.

That said, when you break down the two hypotheses the way I did, you see how
very very stupid the second one is.

I'm not quite sure what you're driving at. Are you saying that people don't
conclude from "ancient gods were treated like ancient kings", hence, "we
shouldn't believe in those ancient gods"? I'm not ignoring stuff, or at least,
I'm not trying to, so perhaps you could explain a bit more fully what you think
I'm ignoring. Really, gods are a bit far along in the history of religion, but
here's what I'm driving at.

Capa claims the Abrahamic god was modeled on kingship in the Abrahamic
cultures. I'd largely agree with that. I say that because you see it in other
places, e.g. at least in later Chinese history, the Chinese pantheon, in some
cases, looks an awful lot like the Chinese emperial bureaucracy. Now I don't
think that's CHANCE at all. What I'm objecting to is the idea that this somehow
impunes said gods. Because I see it as the exact same thing as our models.

For the ancient Near East, they understood how the world works like this.
There's a king, his will is law, Etc. The Chinese understood things in terms of
emperial bureaucracy. Leaving aside Faunus' excellent question, how do we know
the gods didn't come first and earthly governance followed, how is this any
different from what we do today? Darwin hits with evolution. Suddenly we're
explaining cultures and ideas and the gods only know what else in terms of
evolution and natural selection and competition and adaptability. It's still
going on to this very day, see Jl's thing about coping mechanisms.

Computers get big, and suddenly, oh the brain is like a supercomputer, it has
inputs and outputs and networks and hey what if the universe is all bits and
.... We're basically taking a popular model of how we think the world works and
applying it to everything under the sun. WHY do some ideas survive and others
don't? That's evolution baby! That's selection and adaptability and group
selection pressure and ... Why do we have kingship? Well because the gods work
like this and ... Or reverse it, God's a king because ...

If you believe that the origins of animism/the attribution of spirits was, as
Darwin did IIRC, that we attributed will to everything, i.e. we started with
ourselves and reasoned everything else was like us until proven otherwise, then
far from anything changing, we're just using the same old strategy we've used
for thousands of years. Except instead of agency, now it's evolution, or
computers, or quantum mechanics, or whatever the hell the scientific fad of the
month is.

Which is why I'm arguing that, even if you establish that god X is the way it
is because of the ancient form of governance of the culture(s) that worshiped
it, so what? That doesn't tell you much of anything, about the god I mean. We
don't believe our body's like a giant clock anymore, well, a chunk of us don't
anyway, and yet, we still have bodies, and we had them, even when we thought
they were giant meat machines. But we were just doing the same thing, here's
how a clock works, here's ropes and pullies and springs and how mechanical
forces work, hey I'll bet everything in the universe is like that!

Which is why I tend to focus on experience and pragmatics. I mean, we know the
body's not like a giant clock, or the universe, for that matter. That doesn't
mean that the scientists who believed something very much like that back in the
day didn't give us some damn useful stuff, while they were at it. And in some
sense, they were right. I mean, a tendon or ligament or whatever is pretty much
a mechanical device. They just kind of took it too far. So I think my point
still stands. No it's absolutely NOT chance that the Abrahamic god is connected
with Abrahamic kingship. But that doesn't really tell us much. Let's take
Pecc's argument, for instance.

Gods come out of experience, or religions do anyway. So what people want to say
is something like, "weeeeell, but these people experience their god as a king,
and these people as a multiplicity of gods in a bureaucracy, and these people
as multiple gods as one entity, and these people as the sky, and ... So clearly
you can't say the king god is real, or the bureaucracy of the gods, or ..." Why
not? I can model the body as a clock, an energy field, a set of interlocking
systems of organs, and probably a bunch of other things I'm not even thinking
of. Does that mean that NONE of those models are right, simply because there
are a bunch of them, OR that because we've got a bunch of models, we have no
actual BODY experience?

Because that's kind of the god == ancient king argument. It's obviously
ridiculous, the conclusions I mean, if we apply it to the body. Or if you like,
apply it to disease, is it demons/spirits, an imbalance of humors, too much
blood, germs, viruses ... Again, just because we have multiple models of
disease, that doesn't mean people don't get diseases, even if they might
understand them in radically different and incompatible ways. Even if some of
the things aren't things we'd recognize as diseases.

So sure, you can certainly conclude that god == king is a time and culture
bound understanding of said god, and you can argue that we might want to
reconsider said understanding. That understanding might be wrong. Or maybe it
was perfectly valid, assuming said god exists for the moment, and it just acted
differently back in the day. But I mean, I have no problem with somebody
pointing out that the ancient Hebrew god, let's say, looks a hell of a lot like
the ancient Hebrew kings, or maybe we should say, like what the ancient Hebrew
kings WANTED to be.

It's the conclusions I take issue with, things like, it was all "invented" by
people, so why should we bother? Sure, but lots and lots of things were
"invented" by people, like, oh I dunno, language, computers, most of medicine
.... We think they're pretty useful. We don't dismiss them because two hundred
years ago, they used some really odd model we think is totally wrong now. And
to return to my original point, which I can't stress enough, we're STILL doing
it. Ideas work like viruses is pretty much EXACTLY the same thing as, ideas are
put into your mind by spirits. In fact, given things like how we often here
things in our head and such, I'd argue that the latter is a lot closer to what
we experience than the former. We're still making "god like king"/"king like
god" models right till this very day.

   It would be interesting to look at the religions of people whose traditional

concepts of their deities, or of how humans relate to their deities, is
substantially different from the concepts of people for whom monarchy is a sort
of social default.  Without that kind of data, however, I doubt that very much
in the way of productive generalization can be made about the relationship
between terrestrial politics and concepts of the celestial.
   Btw, the Old Testament rather drives the point home that the ancient Hebrews
did *not* have kings, and that their recourse to monarchy was a sort of pis
aller. Their organization had been (according to legend) at first patriarchal,
then prophetic/priestly, then becoming a sort of disorganized federal republic
of tribes, with repeated recourse to military dictators (somewhat like ancient
Rome), before eventually establishing an hereditary kingship. If there's any
truth to the legends, the Hebrew god-concepts were settled on long before they
had kings, or even anything much like our ideas of a state.

experience with one group conquering another group and imposing their religion
by force, but is that really the same as convergence?  I suspect there is still
quite a bit of cultural imperialism going on which puts the squeeze on minority
religions. There are certainly plenty of examples of establishment religions
such as Christianity and Islam displacing smaller indiginous religions.

to converge (when history shows that it mostly doesn't: it has the tendency to
diverge to meet the diverse needs and experiences of the divine of diverse

Well there's a ridiculous amount of similarity in the Judeo-Christian-Islamic
relgions, for example.

All religions are man's way of trying to explain how the universe came into
being, what happens after death, how do you fit in to your society, setting
forth rules of conduct of what is right and what is wrong.

Humanity has an innate sense of all of this ... if you took a bunch of newborns
and stuck them on a desert island (assuming their basic needs were met until
they were old enough to take care of themselves, say this is done covertly as
possible with no communcation between the adults and the newborns or anything)
.... they'd have the same questions humans have always had. And they'd come up
with explanations for why things are they way they are. They'd hear thunder and
think perhaps it is god. Or it would get cold in the winter, and they'd notice
that sometime in december the days start getting longer instead of shorter. And
perhaps they'd celebrate the fact that those days are getting longer, and
warmer.

All religions are man's way of trying to explain how the universe came into
being -- no, not true.  Many forms of Buddhism have no interest in the question
of origins, and while pagan religions often have just-so stories, no one of any
sophistication believed them.

what happens after death -- several religions have little interest in the
period after death.  Some forms of Judaism, for example, just shrug.  My own
religion doesn't much care either, other than as a sort of speculation.

how do you fit into your society -- I'll grant you this one

setting forth rules of conduct -- again, not really.  Not all religions take
morality as their area, or make it a central part of the religion.

Essentially, what you're saying is that from a Judeo-Christian perspective,
common misconceptions about religion all are pretty similar.  Yup.  No doubt.

That doesn't mean the religions are.

Finally, the just-so story theory of religious development is so incredibly
ancient and ignored in modern anthropology, it's hard to even refute without
sputtering.  After all, if religion grows out of just-so stories, whence
comes ritual?  One old theory is that ritual is all reenactment of just-so
stories, but it's not.  Some are, but not all are.

Cool speech by Joseph Campbell:
http://jcf.org/new/contribute/media/sukhvati_companion.zip
(mp3 that someone zipped for some reason)

"In this audio clip from The Sukhavati Companion, Joseph Campbell explores
mythologies that express the individual's identity with the divine, in
distinction to those such as the biblical tradition that seek to offer a
bridge, a relationship to the eternal. He traces the origins of our
contemporary crisis in the West to a failure of the primary aspect of
mythology, that of reconciling us as individuals with our biology, our
societies and the universe around us."

Campbell talks about similarities between Jesus and the Buddha, and about
duality, and a bunch of other stuff. Great stuff ... I've listened to it a few
times now. It's about 30 minutes long.

I wasn't sure whether to post this in Mythology or here, but decided on here
for the hell of it.

So where's the hot Hindu mythology? I ask because you keep hearing these things
about deities, usually Vishnu and Lakshmi or Krishna and Radha, how it's all
loving and they're together but there's also this spiritual element. But every
time I actually look into it, it's "oh SoAndSo was celibate which represents
devotion", "oh SoAndSo had this selfless love for Whomever". Come on. Where's
deities gettin' it on? Or at least, you know, married so we can expect that
sort of thing? I'm not expecting erotica as such, but you keep seeing
references, at least I do, to things that imply it, or at least that said
deities have a good healthy marriage, as it were, and then all of a sudden it's
all celibacy and selfless devotion.

And of course my point isn't that I want religious porn, as it were, though I
have nothing against that. It's that a devoted relationship, ala marriage,
seems to me to be a perfectly fine exemplar of spiritual devotion, and you get
hints about it, so it's frustrating that when I actually try to FIND the
stories that are hinted at, it all evaporates in a cloud of Platonic celibacy.
Nothing against Platonic celibacy mind, I'd just like to see something
different, for once. I don't see why celibacy should be so priveleged over
sexuality, in the religious imagination.

This was prompted by a discussion with my fiance, she was asking about Hanuman,
and whether he had a wife, or Rama had a wife, Etc. So then I had to tell her
about how Sita was faithful but it involved a fire or her being swallowed by
the earth or something, I can't quite remember, but I didn't think Hanuman had
a wife. Apparently that's up for debate. So then I started looking into Krishna
and Radha, thinking SURELY we'd find a relationship there. Nope, it's all
celibacy and selflessness again. All of this reminds me of a book I keep
meaning to read.

It's called "What If The Buddha Were Married?" I presume it's meant to get at
the idea of, OK Buddhism's all about getting rid of atachments and all, but you
have a spouse, OMG! I keep wanting to read it because my response is always
"but the Buddha WAS MARRIED! And we KNOW what he did, he took off and left his
wife and son"! Sure, it all worked out in the end because they converted to
Buddhism, but still.

I've seen some of it. We've got a store that occasionally imports it. I just
find it really interesting that on the one hand, you have this whole thing with
the art and the Kama Sutra and tantra and all, although that gets played up I'm
sure, and on the other hand a huge focus on celibacy. Although reading more
about Hanuman I guess that's a later tradition. But even with some of the
devoted couples, I'm thinking of Shiva and Parvati and to a lesser extent
Vishnu and Lakshmi, there's this weird split.

Oh sure they're devoted, but you know, Shiva's just gonna go hang out in the
forest for some quality alone time, A.K.A. meditation. I guess I'd just like to
see something a bit more focused on that couple aspect, as a spiritual thing,
as opposed to the equivalent of "oh I give him his space, he's out in the

Moving over from the Bible forum, as Gwynn suggested we were wandering a bit
off topic there :)
Thank you for posting those links, Gwynn. You get to the heart of CHristianity
with the death discussion, specifically the self-sacrifice, and the ultimate
self-sacrifice is death. In Christianity this is held up as the epitome of what
good Christians are to be, and the concept of self-sacrifice is held up as
something to be achieved. However the natural outcome of a self-sacrifice is
death. In the extreme example as you have started to draw it a person would
give up eating to avoid killing another being. Or a person would give up eating
instead handing their food to a starving person - and somebody will always
starve so the person striving for self-sacrifice will always have somebody to
die for. However our modern Christians seem to draw a line and say that they
are to strive for self-sacrifice, but WHOA! That's a bridge too far. We're not
self-sacrificing THAT far. We'll do just a little, what is comfortable. It is a
philosophy that is conflicted at the core. I will give up only what is
comfortable to give up is not self-sacrifice. And to live at all, in this line
of thinking, is to deny somebody else the opportunity to live. In this
philosophy we must all die for each other.

That's an interesting take, though not at all what I was driving at. So let me
look at it from that angle for a second, because they actually fit together.

So my take was, roughly, that you have a couple things going on.

1. Jesus died for you, which is supposed to be the best ever.
2. We have a song asking Jesus to prove to the protagonist that they were worth
Jesus' dying for them.
3. In contrast, all SORTS of things die for us every single day so that we can
live, namely plants and animals.

So I guess what I'd say is that by focusing solely on Jesus' sacrifice, and in
order to do that you pretty much have to accept Christianity, you're ignoring
all sorts of other sacrifices that go on all the time. So where I think it fits
in with what you're saying is maybe just that self interest, or ... I dunno
what to call it. I don't think people ignore the sacrifices of plants and
animals out of self interest as such, it's just not something they think about.
And I don't mean to imply that they don't think of it because they're just
thinking of Jesus' sacrifice, but that can't help, of course.

So I guess I'd say a kind of lack of vision. They don't think about plant and
animal sacrifice because it just doesn't occur to them, and they don't think of
self sacrifice in your terms because it's something that's not achievable
anyway, we can't be perfect, otherwise we wouldn't have needed Jesus to die so
that we could live in the first place. But I think I mostly just wanted to play
with the contrast of that notion, Jesus died so that we can live involves me
accepting this whole edifice of beliefs, e.g. there was a Jesus, he was the son
of God, I have sin, I have original sin, that means I should die, the only way
for me to not die is Jesus dying, and so on. By contrast, the pig died so I
could live involves me looking at what's right in front of me, as it were. If
you're a vegetarian then substitute carrots or such for pig.

And speaking of things dying so that we could live, why doesn't this woman have
an album out yet? And no, I'm not kidding. This song makes me happy every time
I hear it. I don't think she intended it to be funny, but man it's hilarious.
Plus she's better than most of the singers you see on TV.

someone can correct me if I get this wrong) was the education of all boys and
men in Scrpiture. They were expected to memorize this stuff, so they knew a lot
of it just offhand. So you have people knowing (not struggling to list) the Ten
Commandments and understanding where Jesus is coming from when he talks about
the two greatest commandments. In that light, Jesus quoting the OT is not weird
at all, and it's totally expected. It would be part of his life as a Jewish
man, and it would show his nay-sayers that he does know the same stuff they
know, which is important. And that's totally aside from anything to do with
fulfillment of prophecy. I mean, my dad quotes part of the OT when he prays
before he starts his sermons, and that's definitely not a fulfilment of
prophecy. ;) (For the curious, I forget the reference right now, but the phrase

Even the concept of God is changing as I progress through the books.
I wanted the most accurate translation avaialble, and you good folks here
suggested the Oxford translation, which was fairly unanimous. I am finding it a
bit disconcerting as I was raised with the King James and reading that, many of
the hymns I knew had sections of KJ, etc. So when I come across a passage I may
or may not recognize it. So in a way I'm missing the KJ, but I think the
accuracy is a worthwhile tradeoff. Curious what others think of that. The KJ
doesn't seem to have much traction nowadays... Everyone seems to have the NIV

I am particularly piqued by the constant references to other gods, and the
footnotes which reference a variety of things. I have to believe that English
is a little limited to translate into lacking a variety of the concepts that
are trying to be expressed. Perhaps a language that had a lot more concepts of
god would be a more nuanced translation.
Speaking of which, I'm interested as well in the characterization of Satan.
Certainly Genesis has the snake, but it's not demonic or Satanic as we now
think of it. Job has, perhaps, the most full concept, and even then Satan has a
place in heaven as almost a prosecutorial role. Again, very different than we
imagine today with hell and eternal torture.
It wasn't even until a recent conversation with a Jewish friend that I realized
the Jews don't have the same concept of hell, and now having read the OT with
the frequent reference to Sheol, I have a better idea of what they believed it
was.
And heaven seemed a very different concept - almost more eastern in terms of a
resting place existing with your ancestors.
But I'm interpreting these cultural concepts from only what I am coming across
in the OT so far. Any comments on either God, Satan, heaven or hell and how
those concepts have changed would be of much interest :)

about those. I'll get to Satan and heaven and hell too, if nobody beats me to
it. Not now though, I gotta go eat yummy food! But yeah, all that stuff's
really interesting. Have you hit, pretty sure it's Ps. 84 yet? If not, Yahweh
tells the other gods that they've been wicked, judge incorrectly, and they'll
"die like men". Christians interpret that to mean he's talking to the kings of
the earth, but in the Hebrew, it's gods.

You've got several words for "god" in Hebrew.  The generic term for a deity is
el.  So God is sometimes called El, often with a suffix, like El Shaddai, which
means something like "almighty god."  (Shaddai is a little more complicated;
just flow with it).  The plural of el is "elohim," which is an irregular plural
(it looks like the masculine plural of a feminine noun, actually, elah, meaning
"goddess" -- but it's probably not.)

Then you've got titles for God himself.  His name, of course, is YHWH, four
consonants in Hebrew that, without vowel pointings, are pronounces -- not at
all.  Instead, you often have adonai, "my lord."  (The fact that this looks a
bit like the Greek god "Adonis" is not a coincidence.  The name of the God is a
semitic borrowing.)

What's interesting, and usually obscured in translation, is that different
books or passages of the bible refer to God by different names.  For example,
Genesis starts with the staetment that "In the beginning [literally, "in a
beginning of . . . " -- if that kind of grammatical error showed up in a
student's paper, I'd write "Please proofread!" on the margin, but do it several
thousand years ago, and you get a holy book.  Go figger.] god created the
heavens and the earth."  But the word for "god" there is elohim.  Granted, the
verb is still singular, so if the plural "gods" is meant it's meant ina
singular sense: they're acting together.  Later, in Genesis, YHWH makes an
appearance and is called by name.

Now, if the Elohim are a council of minor and lesser gods that YHWH demotes and
takes over from after they create the universe, then the question is, is Satan
one of the Elohim?  Huh.  Neat.

Yahweh borrowed a lot from Baal as well, e.g. they're both referred to as
"rider of clouds". Here's another whacky parallel. You know how in some fo the
prophets, Ezek. in particular, Judah and Israel, the two kingdoms, are referred
to as Yahweh's wives?

Here's a summarized Canaanite myth, since I couldn't find it online. El is
walking by the sea one day when he meets two girls/women, or maybe they're with
him. Anyway, it comes up that if his staff shoots up to heaven and brings down
two birds, (the symbolism is totally subtle here you guys!), then the "girls
are the wives of El, the wives of El and his forever". If his staff doesn't get
the birds, i.e. it doesn't shoot up into heaven, they're the daughters of El.
Surprise of surprises, El's staff bags two birds, and later, two wives.

So even some of that stuff, which makes total metaphorical sense where it's
used, might go right back to some far older mythology.

Sorry, Pecc - meant it was intriguing :)

Gods> The early mentioned in the OT seemed more of a comparison - you are above
any of the other gods, was the type I came across. Then there were the
commandments by God not to worship other gods - and only sometimes are they
referred to as false, indicating there are gods othern than the God of the
Bible, at least in those times. I just finished Psalm and there were a number
of references that didn't quite fit the other categories:
http://biblez.com/search.php?q=gods+psalms
The footnotes seemed to indicate in some places that it was a reference to
other officials. 136 and 138 both indicate the presence of other gods.
Gwynn's point about 84 is right and I think that's another place that mentions
that the word "gods" in the translation really is speaking to officials or
kings. It would seem awfully confusing to translate it that way, so I'm not
certain why the word "gods" would be used as it doesn't really capture the
meaning in English. Ah well :) Finding it all fascinating.

Wow, nobody's beaten me to Satan or evolving gods yet? OK, here we go then.
Let's tackle gods first.

As Pecc's pointed out, Yahweh/El/Etc. shares a LOT in common with his Canaanite
ancestors. IIRC in one class on the Bible I took it was suggested that the
Hebrews might have gotten Yahweh from somewhere else, the Mideonites I think,
but I also think we're not really sure who or where they were. Not only did
parts of the OT admit other gods as gods, in the archeological record there are
suggestions that, just as there were multiple Baals, i.e. Baal of SuchAndSuch a
place, there were multiple Yahwehs, we have inscriptions to Yahweh of Place A
and Yahweh of Place B.

Some of the stuff mentioned as totally evil in the Bible probably reflected
actual cult practices, which the official religion of the Bible was trying to
stamp out. The golden calf is a famous one, in the archeological record we have
lots of bulls, a common fertility symbol all over the ancient Near East. I
don't remember if we have definite ties like an inscribed bull, but the upshot
is, the bulls represent Yahweh.

Here's another one, you know how theBible keeps making references to kings
tearing down ashera poles? Or maybe ashtoreth, I can never keep all the
spellings straight. Well, El's wife, the Canaanite El this is, was Asherah, and
as some French Biblical scholar put it "whatever an ashera was, Yahweh had
one". Maybe it was just some sort of cult object, the aforementioned poles, or
maybe it was God's wife. Whatever it was, the two are tied together. See:

http://archive.org/details/AndAdamKnewEveADictionaryOfSexInTheBible_546

The temple of Solomon sounds suspiciously like the palace of Baal. See:

http://www.theologywebsite.com/etext/canaanite/baal.shtml

BTW, note how Baal defeats Yam in the beginning. Yam means sea, I'm pretty sure
Nahar means river BTW. There are passages about Yahweh setting limits on the
sea and/or fighting Leviathan, a giant sea monster. So lots of parallels going
on between Baal and Yahweh. That's probably why it was so easy for the Hebrews
to worship Baal, and why it was so frowned upon by the cult of Yahweh. Note the
divine craftsman Kothar, compare to Wisdom in Proverbs.

OK, Satan! True, the serpent is the serpent, not necessarily Satan. I forget if
that's Christian tradition, or if it shows up in Rabinic Judaism as well. And
Job pretty much has the original function "ha satan", the adversary, most
people say to think of it like a prosecutor. Satan starts getting evil, I
think, after the Babylonian exile, IIRC Judaism picks up stuff from
Zoroastrianism. Christian tradition runs with it, and I don't need to tell you
about that.

Some other demons:  Belial gets picked up in Medieval times, but it just means
"worthless" in Hebrew and wasn't a demon, it occurs in 1 Sam., Eli(?) calls his
sons "sons of belial" because they drink wine Etc., basically "sons of
worthlessness".

Beelzebub: Nice and famous, supposedly "lord of flies", but IIRC there was a
Canaanite god called El-Zebub or such, or maybe a goddess. It's been ages since
I've looked into it and IIRC they keep finding new stuff in the archeology.

Azazel: I don't think we quite know who/what Azazel was, but it's what the
scapegoat got sent to.

Lucifer: Latin obviously, but taken from a passage in Isa. about the "morning
star", which is actually talking about a king this time, of Babylon or Assyria,
can't recall which. It's funny that Ps. 84 gets interpreted by both traditions
as being about kings, since neither can admit the existence of other gods, and
this one, talking of a king, gets interpreted, by Christianity at least, as a
supernatural being. This is where the story of "the fall" comes from, and it's
pretty much wrong. But that's people for you. When I say "wrong", I mean that
in context, it's pretty obviously talking about a king, not telling the story
of a rebel angel.

Wow! Thank you, Gwynn! Hugely useful! I recall Azazel mentioned once, and I
think there were other unnamed "demons" early on in the OT which again gave me
a perception of a much populated spiritual stage. I'm fascinated by that, and
the "extra-biblical" stories. I have never come across a story of Lucifer being
an angel and then falling from grace to become Satan, but somehow I know the
sotry. Is that actually in the Bible? Or is it sort of an extra-Biblical story
that even Protestants know of, beleive in, and pass along? Sort of a modern
mythology that isn't formal canon? Additionally, as I understand it,
Catholicism has a number of angels, demons, and supernatural beings that are
actively engaged with each other and with humans in different ways.
I was raised in a Quaker church, so we have scant characters in our stories.
There's humans, God, and Satan. Then once in a while you get an angle, like
Gabriel, but pretty much he just gets to make an announcement and is never
heard of again. (Gargh - that's angel above)
Anyways, I'm just fascinated by what is written scripture, and what is not -
and then what people readily believe yet is not written anyhere that they think
it is, and what is contained in the Bible that people "believe each and every
word" yet is anathema to their actual morals.

Like, imagine a future world in which the only things known about
America were histories written by racist libertarian Ron Paul fan gun
nuts.  Like, if they took The Turner Diaries to be a work of history,
and thought that the history of America really was a history of
fighting against constant subversion by evil communists and Jewish
"banksters," and their tool of evil, Statism, and a constant threat of
uprisings by unruly, savage blacks, all threatening the traditions
from a period of pure enlightened wisdom from Christian Founding

That's the kind of thing you're getting with the Old Testament -- an

A husband is under no obligation to be monogamous to his wife, but a

A man *is* under an obligation to take any woman he is having sex with

While I'd rather not become involved in the discussion invited by QUITTNER's
reference to the Hebrew word 'alma', Peccavimus' response provides occasion to
not that the first appearance of the Hebrew word 'betulah' (virgin) appears in
an interesting context.  Describing Rebekah, Genesis 24:16 reads as follows:
"The maiden was very beautiful, a virgin whom no man had known."  (The Hebrew,
beginning with the word 'virgin' is "betulah v'ish lo yeda'ah.")

The redundancy posed an exegetical problem for the rabbinic commentators.  Does
anyone happen to know how Rashi, considered the most formidable of all Jewish
exegetes, resolved the problem?  If not, take a shot at guessing, or offering
your own interpretation.

So, below you'll find Rashi's commentary on the phrase in Genesis 24:16 in
which Rebekah is described as "a virgin whom no man had known."  What is at
issue is the apparent redundancy of "whom no man had known," after the text has
already declared Rebekah a "virgin."  You'll be hard pressed to find Rashi's
commentary in English translation.  It has been expunged from the
Rosenbaum/Silbermann set - probably the most oft-published of all English
translations of Rashi's commentary on the Pentateuch.  Likewise, you won't find
it in the compilations used in Jewish day schools.  Any reputable set of
"Mikraot G'dolot" *will* show it, though I don't happen to own (and am not
familiar with) a set that comes with an English translation.  So, what follows
is my translation of the Hebrew.

Rashi writes: "It wasn't her (i.e. Rebekah's) practice, as was the case with
non-Jews, to preserve the place of virginity while engaging in licentiousness
from another place."   In other words, the "heathen" women would engage in anal
intercourse (or fellatio?) so as to preserve their claims to virginity.  The
phrase "whom no man had known," thus refers to anal intercourse (or, perhaps
fellatio), and the intent of the passage is to establish that Rebekah engaged
in neither one nor the other form of sex.

I've long found this to be an interesting...er...passage.  When I first
discovered it, my initial thought was, "Shit!  If they had taught this when I
was younger, I might actually have paid attention."

abstinence only education and why it doesn't work for some people. Because you

OK, this one's for Kyoti:

The Bible just ain't enough reading material. So if you're interested in
Biblical parallels, here's some stuff to check out.

Ancient Near Eastern Texts Related to the Old Testament: This is the classic. I
should see if anybody's updated it yet.

The Context of Scripture: This is I think a three Vol. set, and you might be
interested in some more than others. Vol. 1 is nice, I haven't gotten to the
others yet, I think one is all laws, so if that's not your thing, you'll want
to skip it.

Then you can get into ancient Near Eastern mythology, e.g. Sumerian,
Babylonian, Canaanite, Etc. Some of it's online for free, notably Sumerian:

For instance, compare The Lament for Urim with Lamentations, particularly from
line 64 onward:

http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.2.2.2&charenc=j#

You see the same concerns about gods, in the Bible it's the Hebrews forsaking
Yahweh and going after other gods, here it's that the city has been conquered,
"O city, your rites have been alienated from you, your powers have been changed
into alien powers." There are compositions like "A Man and His God" which are
IIRC debates, much like Eclesiastes or possibly Job. it's been a while since
I've read this stuff, it's a nice excuse to get back into it really.

   There are a lot of words in various languages where the meanings of "young
woman" and "virgin" (and, for that matter, "unmarried woman") overlap.  For
instance, in slightly archaic English, "maid" or "maiden". It *can* just mean
"young woman", but it *often* means "virginal young woman".
   The reason for this is pretty obvious. If you have a culture in which (a)
most women are (presumed to be) virgins up to marriage; in which (b) marriage
takes place very shortly after puberty (which, however, was probably some years
later than it currently, closer to 15 than 12); and in which a married woman is
deemed, in social terms to be an adult, then there is will be a very large
number of women for which the transition from youth to maturity, from virginity
to sexuality, and from an unmarried to a married state happen nearly
concurrently.  Given those assumptions, any word designating a "young woman"
will be ambiguous as to whether it also entails, or merely presumes, virginity
as well.
   That said, in the passage in Isaiah, context makes it clear that the "young
woman" is both married and non-virginal.
   However, that doesn't necessarily apply to the re-use of the passage in a
Christian context. The Christian (and presumably, 1st-century Jewish as well)
understanding of "prophecy" was largely non-contextual, and depended on seeing
passages of Biblical text as having a second meaning divorced from the original
context in which they were written. The prophecies were *signs*, significant
texts, whose meaning was not to be found in their author's intention or their
historical setting, but rather was to be guessed at through inspiration and
eventually revealed by history. Even if 'almah meant "young woman" in context
in Isaiah, that would not stop the *decontextualized* verses from having a
*new* meaning applied to the present, in which "young woman" could be
reinterpreted as "virgin". The slight difference in emphasis between 'almah and
parthenos (which is less than it seems, since parthenos can also mean "girl"
and "unmarried woman", not necessarily a virginal one) simply reflects an
already complex system of strata of meaning.
   And since the idea of "a virgin bearing a son" is the more unusual, the more
miraculous, it is thereby more *significant* -- that is, better creates a
"sign", a token of the presence of God -- and the more suited to prophetic
interpretation.

Thank you, Mama. I was just going to post that. If we all had the same common
goal, and the same priorities and underlying values, then we'd all act in
concert with each other. It doesn't matter what that system is, just that it is
consistently shared across each individual AND that each individual
consistently act according to it.

Just hit the sections in Isiah with the prophet pushing for recognizing him as
the only God. And hit the sections that the other thread is talking about with
regards to a young woman. The Oxford footnote mentions that this could be in
reference to the king's family or Isiah's own family. It's interesting as the
Oxford footnotes don't really push tying it in with the NT and Jesus as the
fulfillment of this passage. I would have expected it to. Instead I've noticed
that a lot of footnotes appear to be written more by academic Biblical scholars
than by Christians - maybe it's the use of BCE that underscores that even the
more.

That's the nice thing about that Bible. Of course, per Vanity's post, you don't
have to accept that understanding, or rather, you can, but also still hold that
it has another meaning, e.g. Isa. can be talkign about a king, but also Satan
rebelling against God. So I don't think the Oxford Bible is trying to undermine
Christianity, as it were, with the academic footnotes. It's just going "here's
the academic understanding of stuff". You might get some underming, e.g. OT
parallels sort of undermine the Biblical claims of Hebrew uniqueness in some
ways, but I think that's just a side effect of finding out about this stuff.

The real issues for the OT come in when you get into the archeology, and that's
pretty hotly debated even today in some circles. For instance, I don't know if
we've been able to find anything about king David. IIRC we haven't really found
any evidence for the first temple either, the one supposedly built by Solomon I
mean. But I think I posted about that one already. In case I didn't though:

Thank you both :) I found any questions as a child were quickly brushed off. I
thought any questioning, any examinations, would damn me to hell, so I didn't
question or examine anything. And certain things bothered me deeply about what
appeared to be commonly held beliefs, such as original sin. Wait, I'm damned
for something somebody else did? It took until I was a young adult to have that
space and really give voice to what I believed. And it took me even longer to
say the A word - athiest. I have a firm belief system, and it isn't
incompatible with the commandments (of many religions) of how we treat each
other. You don't initiate force against anyone through physical violence,
lying, coersion, etc. It's based more a rational thinking and choices and not
because I get a big reward after I die.
But I'm still fascinated to look back at what I was taught and how I understood
it. And am fascinated that, within the US, we have a predominantly Christian
based culture. So first it is useful to understand the cultural references for
everything from reading a book to watching tv. And second I am fascinated with
how many people process they believe in something they have never read or do
not know the contents of. And third, like Gwynn, I do find the history of how
these pieces accummulated and were curated to be interesting.
I can't say I struggle with this as an active internal tension. I know what I
believe and have it very separate from my current study of the Bible. Perhaps
clarifying is a more useful verb.

Oh, as I was making it through Song of Solomon (or as it appears to have been

bridegroom expressing his love for his bride, and he says, "I will call you my

says that in ancient Egypt "my sister" was a common term for a loved one in
this way.
I'm sure there's debates in the translation community about how faithfully you
translate a concept retaining the original language homologue vs translating
the concept. The translators could have chose to translate it as "my dearest"
or "my soul mate" or anything else - especially that would not be confused as
incest-like in a modern reading.
Anyways, just tossing out that observations. I'm sure you much more learned and

Actually, I didn't convert because I saw something wrong in my life. I
converted because I had philosophical issues with Christianity. I don't think I
was particularly unhappy in Christianity, as such. I grew up UCC and they were
pretty mellow. And it was probably a fairly conservative congregation at that,
being composed mostly of older folks. I used to get the bulletins after I moved
for a while, and I always loved reading them, because it was all "SoAndSo had a
fire, we're totally organizing to help them. SoAndSo wants to go to Bible camp
but can't afford it, can you help?" It was totally social justice stuff and
helping the community and all that.

As far as my philosophical issues, it's entirely possible I could find a
version of Christianity that doesn't have them, in fact I think between Faunus
and Hooligan they could point me at one in about five seconds. I'm not
particularly interested in finding one, but I'm sure it's out there. Actually,
it's entirely possible the Quakers don't have them. As an example, I don't
really see the point of incarnation if God knows what we're going to do
already. Directly following from that is the 80-100 years to make a choice, a
choice God ultimately knows in advance so again what's the point, between
infinite bliss or infinite torment.

Now I guess you could say I was unhappy in the sense that I did have these
issues, but I mean, they didn't keep me up nights or anything. They were just
things I disagreed with Christianity on, as I understood it. I also was kind of
dissatisfied that we didn't seem to be doing much at church, I thought we
should be learning more or discussing things or something. You think things
like that when you're a teenager. But I mean, while I wouldhave been way more
happy going out and experiencing nature as opposed to going to church to
connect with God, I wasn't having any sort of major crisis, either in terms of
faith so to speak, or in my life, I wasn't high or anything like that.

I just sort of started disagreeing with Christianity, then I hit things like
Crowley, I still like his description/explanation of cabalah in the Book of
Thoth because he ties it into geometry, and a friend introduced me to Wicca
later, which made a lot more sense, probably because of the experience I had
when they introduced me. I kind of drifted out of Wicca into animism
eventually, but that's probably much less radical a break than that between
Christianity and Wicca.

So I guess I feel happier in that I think things kind of fit more, you know?
But I didn't have some sort of big crisis experience of any sort. I just kind
of went "you know, I really don't know if this stuff's for me". Of course, I
used to debate theology with our pastor and ask him really bizarre questions
about the OT, like "did the angel of death that killed the Egyptian firstborn
have a name"? He was really awesome and happily debated with me, because I was
actually thinking and engaging stuff I suspect, and he tried to research my
weird OT questions.

Oh I should tell my confirmation story. So my mom wanted me to get confirmed. I
objected that I saw no need to get up in front of everybody and go through a
ceremony, surely that was between me and God. God knew whether I was going to
do what I was supposed to or not, Etc. Well eventually she goes "you're jsut
not thinking about this right, we need to get Pastor Gil out here". So Pastor
Gil shows up, and mom says her bit, and I say mine, and we get to the end. So
he turns to mom and says "well, I'm not trying to undermine you or tell you
what to do as a parent or anything, but I can guarantee you he's thought about
this way more than anybody else going through confirmation classes". I mostly
missed those because we lived 45 minutes away, it was the church mom grew up
in. I eventually got confirmed to make mom happy, but yeah, that's how awesome
he was.

But I don't know that there's a bias for people converting for other reasons to

going to be a bias towards people being more happy on the average after
conversion.

In other words, I'm proposing that there will probably not be many people who
are converting when they are at an unusually good part of their lives, while
there will be a number who will do it at an unusually bad part. And then there
will be a number like you who convert for reasons having nothing to do with

It didn't really. I think she's probably skeptical of where I'm at, but she
doesn't really know a ton about it. My mom's one of those "you show up to
church because you should show up to church" people, actually, she might not
even go. A big draw for her I think was the bit of socializing with all the
people she grew up with, so she might not have a church now that she's stopped
going to that one.

She's kind of weird. For instance, she doesn't understand what the problem is
if, say, a city council wanted to open its meeting with a prayer, because "it's
God, we're all talking about the same thing", so if you're Muslim or Hindu or
whatever, you just be silent and pray your own prayer silently or accept that
when they say "God", they mean whatever you think of when you think of that
stuff. Which sounds tolerant in a weird way, until you go, like I do
repeatedly, "OK, so what if the Hindu wants to do the prayer then, why can't
you just think of God when he says Ganesh or whatever"? To which she responds,
very vehemently, "because that's not what we do!"

So her argument isn't really that the Hindu's a filthy heathen, it's more that
the majority of the community is Christian, and doing your weird minority thing
would violate community norms, probably pretty typical conservative reasoning
really. I always used to get on her, I think I mentioned this, about how we
weren't really learning anything at church, you know we weren't really finding
out more about God or whatever. For her it really was the social aspect I
think, so she just didn't care about any of that, church was just something
nice that you went to. Since it was 45 minutes away that meant I had to be up
before eight on a Sunday, and hence, I really didn't see the point in going
much. I had to of course, but still.

It probably doesn't help that I've always been fascinated with mythology, other
cultures, Etc. I wasn't there for it, but apparently my uncle's brother invited
some missionary guy who was in, I can't quite remember, South America or
Haiti, and it was typical "their religion is all evil demons" or maybe "they
don't even have a religion", another perennial favorite with fundies. Mom told
me about it and I'm just like, "yeah, right, whatever. Then I think I said
something about how they're just as attached to their religion, i.e. they get
stuff out of it and all, as this guy is to his".

I think mom's basic view, and this was probably true of the congregation as a
whole, is that your weird religion is your weird religion. Ideally you
shouldn't be doing that, you should be doing Christianity, but you leave her
alone and she'll leave you alone. I think she, and the rest of the
congregation, would be far more likely to object to specific
practices/deities/Etc., and of course the more they differed from Protestant
Christianity, the more they'd probably object. But I think those objections
would be much more on normality grounds, see prayer discussion above, than any
sort of theological reasoning.

conceptualized the spatial universe (basically: here, there, and beyond). I.e.,
there's the present, one's own lifetime, which has a sort of linear order and
causal narrative; then there's the more distant past, in which one's parents
and grandparents lived, which is a bit more nebulous, but still has a few
linear narratives embedded in it; and then there's anything back beyond, oh,
one's great-grandparents' time, which is all one big mass of "Past", without

The book of Kells was done in 800AD, it is gorgeous.

I was talking about Celtic polytheism, which they don't write anything down,
and everything related to it, was either hidden or destroyed. Or actually
might be in the vatican given the vatican hill was named after the Vates.

They essentially tell stories that relate to their audience with the main
morality points. For instance take the 10 commandments, and write a story as
those would relate to your friends life, embellish it a bit so it is
interesting, but incorporate the 10 commandments.

That is a living word.. You change the story, you don't change the message
of the story. It is a formula, kind of like they use for tv shows, or movie
plots.

It isn't exactly a far reach to say it -couldn't- have been incorporated.

Take the paganism laws of society and morality, simplify it, by only having
1 god, and 1 average joe type of person that everyone can relate to. Then
write stories using that dude as the main charactor. you could end up with
"the bible" which is the living word of god.

person over and over again changed it up a bit so there was only 1 god.
Which keeps the stories simpler to remember and recite. so yeah it
is kind of like the 1001 arabian nights, you have a druid captured, exhiled,
or visiting the arabic world, and he tells a bunch of stories with
his morality and changes them up to fit the audience.

Now that being said, jesus really could have existed and the stories
all real.

Not trying to knock the socks off anyones religious beliefs...
just saying you can make a case that isn't nearly as far-fetched as
what it would initially seem.

military occupation was a punisjment by God for disobedience, and that he
therefore wanted to start the churches consisting ONLY of GOOD people, who
always did what God wanted them to do, and NEVER did what God did NOT wanted
them to do. He helped many Jews who got themselves into trouble provided they

I think it is on topic here since it is a discussion about the bible and
christianity. Human's decided what books to include in the bible, and the
included chapters were essentially based on if they were written by a seer
(apostle) or in celtic terms an ovate/vate (hill of the vates == vatican)
and including something to the effects of "the lord said" or "this is
the word of the lord". There were also a number of manuscripts not accepted,
and a number that never made it to a canon.

I mean even the election of a new pope, seems like a pagan ritual with
the fire and wood smoke, and all in seclusion. I would think that is
how a druid would elect a new leader too.

BODY: 
     I was just looking at Google images of God the Father, which I find
fascinating: http://tinyurl.com/bxalwmb
     One of the things that interests me about this kind of imagery is that it
has a considerable coherence, despite the nearly complete lack of scriptural or
even apocryphal /pseudepigraphical descriptions of God the Father. Another is
that I come from a family background where this kind of depiction would be
considered as, in principle, essentially blasphemous, so it has a kind of
forbidden-fruit quality about it. It's a depiction that seems largely limited
to Western, Catholic art, particularly of the late mediaeval-early modern
periods -- though there may also be a few Orthodox icons as well.
    My impression is that Christianity has gone from being aniconic (like
Judaism and Islam) to admitting images of Jesus, since his humanity could be
depicted, to using essentially similar images to represent either the glorified
Jesus, or the Son as a member of the Trinity. Once that was done, it wasn't a
big step to making representations of the Trinity which included all its
members, including God the Father -- at first in somewhat symbolic terms, then
in a highly realistic mode. At last you come to glorious pieces of graven
imagery like this: http://snurl.com/268cyjx, which seems to represent a
complete reversal of the notion that God, being an invisible spirit, should
never be represented (as were, presumably, the Gods of Ammon and Moab and the
Phoenicians and Philistines) by a carved facsimile in the likeness of a man.
    I know that this kind of representation fell out of favor by the 18th
century, and I might have some difficulty in tracking down such images in the
United States. Nonetheless, the general *type* of image seems to live on in the
imagination, I suppose through cartoons and perhaps the occasional religious
drama. It's a curious artistic excursion.
    I guess you could say that these paintings and sculptures are really more
illustrative and educational than strictly iconic; that they reminded people of
religious teachings, but that people did not (as far as I know) actually pray
*to* them. It's a plausible distinction, though I don't know how far whoever
first wrote down the Commandments would be convinced by it. I have a harder
time, however, dealing with the possible objection that such images undermine
one of the Christian (or, more generally, Monotheist) claims to uniqueness,
namely, that Christianity doesn't just offer up another god with a different
name, but an entirely different *type* of God, distinct in character from the
gods of the Nations. Yes, I know that such an argument could still be made
intellectually -- but on the emotional level on which art functions, isn't one
sort of anthropic image pretty much interchangeable with another one? On a
visual level, what distinguishes such an image of God the Father from one of:
Brahma: http://tinyurl.com/bja3nva
or The Jade Emperor: http://tinyurl.com/atvfrz9
or Ahura Mazda: http://tinyurl.com/ah8p4rg
    Except that one is formed according to the canons of Western art and the
others are not? I suspect most theologians would resist reducing differences in
religion to differences of artistic style. But let's say, for the sake of
argument, that there were a foreign religion whose images of their gods --
despite being totally different in names, powers, and myths -- closely
resembled Western images of God the Father and God the Son. Wouldn't that
religion automatically gain a certain increased degree of credibility in the
West?

size to each side, you get a bigger triangle. Then you keep going, with each
new set of triangles being the same size as the previous triangle, and you get
larger and larger triangles. You can use them to make a kind of sphere, Etc.

No, not a Sierpinski triangle. As I understand it, that's formed by taking a
triangle and splitting a side into thirds, basically turning each side into a
triangle, then splitting each side of the resulting triangles, and so on. The
thing I'm talking about grows from a central triangle and just forms a larger
total triangle. So:

Draw a triangle pointing upward where the length of each side is 3. Now draw
three more triangles like that, such that each base of the new triangle is
along a side of the original triangle. You'll end up with a triangle of length
6, pointing downward. Do the same thing again, each new triangle will have
length 6, and you'll end up with a triangle of length 9, pointing upward again.
I was really kind of bummed that this isn't actually a fractal, but the people
in Physics and Math, who ought to know, say it ain't. Followups to Physics and
Math, I'd guess.

Well, let's wax mystical geometrical, then.  I'll try to bend this in a
Neoplatonic Christian perspective, to keep it topical.

Take an infinite, featureless plain extending in all directions.  It is
perfectly unified, perfectly meaningless: without form, and void.

Place a point on it.  I would say, "anywhere," but there is no where *until*
you place the point.  Placing the point creates relation.  Placing it assumes
the placement of other points in relationship to it: it breaks the featureless
plain into infinite potential points, all in some relationship to the first
point.  Now there is a face for the face of god to move upon.

Select one of those infinite other potential points and instantiate it.  Now
you have two points: call them day and night, or the waters above and the
waters below.

We can connect these points with a line.  Call it AB.  Swing it in an arc,
first all the way around A, instantiating all the points equidistant from A as
A is from B.  Then do the same with B.  You have two circles that overlap: the
vesica piscis.  Place a point where circle A and circle B intersect, which will
create a new line, CD, that perfectly bisects AB.  Draw lines connecting ACB
and ADB.  These are two perfect equilateral trangles.

We can keep going, deriving perfect squares, perfect stars of many types, and
other geometrical figures, all with nothing but straight lines and circles.
The mystical bit is to realize that all this complexity exists in potentiality
in the single featureless point.  Out of infinite simplicity arises infinite
complexity.

That stuff right there, man, that's my bible.

I should think about that. But as an animist, there's not a ton of go to
places, at least that I've found. There are a couple interesting articles here
and there, so if you're interested in that, let me know. But I don't know that
I've found a ton of sites. In fact articles might be pushing it. But I'm much
less about gods and such and more about spirits these days.

But that can get pretty vague. I mean, I'm talking something like, how does an
environment interact with you? If you're playing music in it for instance, how
does it affect that? That's sort of the stuff I've been getting into lately.
Interesting, but pretty obscure I think. And not all of it is from a pagan
perspective at all, in fact a lot of that is semi-electronic music, e.g.
environmental osunds and acoustic instruments are combined and manipulated
electronically, to a greater or lesser degree. But there is a philosophy behind
it. For instance:

http://www.23five.org/lchasse/index.html

In particular, the Otic Diaries. I'm working on something connecting voice,

3. Semi-related anecdote:

There's a thing in literature called magical realism. Basically it's when a
vast chunk of the book is what we call "real", but suddenly a ghost shows up,
or you get a visit from your dead grandmother giving you advice, or she appears
on the TV during the moon landing, Etc. It shows up in a lot of Latin American
and Native American literature, IIRC it started to describe Latin American
lit., Pecc can feel free to correct me.

Well, I thought this was dumb, because it's basically saying, well, we don't
want to insult them, but it's not "real", because it's got that magic stuff in
it. So we have to make a new category for it now! So I told my Native American
lit teacher, I want to call my final paper "Magical Realism Sucks". She said go
ahead, so I did. Too bad I don't have it anymore, heh. But it always pissed me
off that, because we had "magic" or "the supernatural" showing up, not as a
horror/fantasy element, but just as part of people's every day lives, we had to
make some new category to describe that, because it violates our precious
notion of realism.

I actually wrote a paper arguing something similar in grad school.  I argued
that, because in some NA American literature, people have visions, but that
visions are part of some NA cultures, it therefore is not magical realism but
just plain realism.  (Not Realism, with a capital R, of course)

On a similar note, I've argued for ages now that we think native peoples make a
category mistake, but that's not true. I think category mistake is wrong, but
I've never gotten a better phrase for it. What I mean is, we go, wait, you said
you talked to the spirits yesterday, but that's not "real", like you building a
house last week is "real". So then we go, ah, these poor benighted fools don't
know what's real and what's not!

In other words, they can't distinguish categories like WE can, this thing's
real, this thing's a dream, that thing's a hallucination. But what I think is,
they know perfectly well that there's a difference between building a house and
doing shamanism and talking to the spirits. Hence, for instance, many South
American groups use of plants to induce different states of consciousness, as
we'd describe it.

But saying, this thing occurred like building a house, this occurred like a
dream, Etc., that's just not relevant to them. Because just like building a
house gets something done and is meaningful, talking to the spirits gets
something done and is meaningful. But because we, as Westerners, tend to
collapse things into the binary opposition of "real" and "!real", we assume
they're somehow mistaken. Which sort of reminds me of Pecc's latest posto n
belief, we think belief is totally important to magic. I think that's because
that somehow makes it "real" to Westerners, oh, it's this BELIEF I have, so
it's like doing psychology on me and stuff, I get that, neato!

    Medieval stories featuring dragons or unicorns are now regarded as

Which Satan?

You could consult the Dragon Rouge, which is the sine qua non of Satanic
grimoire magic.  Or you could try your hand at the Goetia, but "Satan" isn't
among the demons listed.

Folk-magic wise, it's really quite easy.  Find a crossroad and go there at
midnight with your contract already written up.  You will need a vase of your
own blood, a small metal pitchfork, some rum (for various reasons, 151 is
acceptable), and a cigar.  Pour the rum at the middle of the crossroad.  Fold
the contract in half toward you, then turn it 90 degrees counter clockwise and
fold it toward you again, then repeat.  Lay it under the vase of blood (you may
have to put a rock on it to weigh it down) and place the pitchfork in the blood
tines up.  Light the cigar and blow smoke around you in four directions,
turning counterclockwise.

The words you're supposed to speak to summon him are a bit hard to dig up, and
here's where you shoudl feel absolutely free to crib from the Dragon Rouge.
I'll leave it to your googlefu.

The vase can be quite small, as long as the pitchfork fits in it.

(And I'm technically showing you how to summon Exu to strike a deal with him;
he's not exactly Satan, although he is associated with Lucifer in Condomble.
By the way, I feel constrained to point out that although I know you're just
kidding around to kill time, doing the ritual I describe will actually
accomplish something.  You won't get lightning and the image of a goat in a

The point of meditation is not to clear the mind.  It's just to not cling to
what comes into the mind.  So something arises that pisses you off.  you notice

Then you'd want to try mindfulness meditation.

Just FYI, I have very mixed results doing divination for myself as well, but
usually when I do it for others, it's useful. So YMMV. And if you're into
music, there's always mantra meditation, of course. IMO I've found a key to
good divination is to get into a bit of trance, but meditation would do it too
I'd bet, yeah. Basically you gotta get a little messed up, if that makes sense.
It's kind of like you draw inward but push outward at the same time. I'm trying
to think of a good analogy.

OK, have you ever been in the woods, or on a mountain, something like that? And
if you get just really quiet, you're kind of aware of yourself, but at the same
time you're kind of aware of all the other stuff? Like your awareness is going
outward, expanding? That's kind of what I'm talking about. Of course, if you've

just note that they're there, one at a time, and let them go.  Don't try to

them.  Just be an observer -- here's this thought, okay, now I know it's there,

   If you spend time *counting* your breaths, you may get caught up in the

Mama K:

Have you tried music, or sound? One thing I've noticed, I read this somewhere
or other and it seems to be true for me, is that a singing bowl can stop the
inner dialogue. Now I'm not saying, go buy a singing bowl, try one in a store
if you've got one that sells them. They're a bit expensive, depending on size,
and you'll find that different bowls work differently for you, and you might
need a bit to get the hang of them, if you've never played one before.

Basically what you do is run the stick around the bowl in a circle, until it
starts vibrating. You can also it in a small arc along the bowl, particularly
once it's started going. In general, I favor bowls with more complex sounds, as
opposed to some of the crystal ones that do a very loud tone which is
impressive at first, but it has no depth. A good singing bowl, IMO, will have
different kinds of sounds, a deeper tone, higher ringing sounds, Etc, though it
might take a bit of attention to hear these.

If you don't want to spend any money, or don't have it in the first place,
there's always something like mantras of course. I mentioned the singing bowls
though because they do kind of grab ahold of you and give you something to
focus on, through both touch and hering. For me it's something that I can fall
into pretty quickly. Obviously, like all ritual items, they're completely
unnecessary, so it just depends on whether that works for you or not.

The more you meditate on a regular basis, at the same time, in the same spot,
under the same conditions if possible, the more your brain will be trained to
relax. It's just like learning anything new, it takes practice :) What used to
work for me (I don't need it anymore) was something my yoga teacher taught me
and that was to envision something of your choosing to "strike" or "Erase" the
thoughts that came into your mind. So say you are trying to meditate and "shit,
I forgot to get chicken for dinner" comes to mind. you acknowledge the thought,
and then remove it by using something visual. In my case I pictured a lightning
bolt zapping the thought it would be gone. To start, I had to do that
constantly, and it seemed very pointless, as I didn't feel I was meditating at
all. But it got increasinly less until it rarely happened and then "true"
meditation got a lot easier. But, like anything, it takes training your brain
to get to that state. Learning how to do it is so very good for you, and helps
you maintain your sanity and stress levels immensely. Don't give up, give it
time, even if you dont' feel like anything is happening.

of purely musical meditation. My favorite kantele player, Arja Kastinen, has a
youtube channel, and she plays in the old way. Here's her youtube channel.

She's posting an improvization a month. Notice how the current improvization
starts out very simply, and stays with that for a good while before getting
more complicated. I point this out because the big objection I hear with people
and music is that they can't play, which seems to mean, I'm not good enough to
go perform, well so what? I say if you find three notes you like, play those,
it's your music after all, not anybody else's. Here's her explanation of her

Ok, answering my own questions from earlier.....

Prayer for me is talking to A) the Universe, and B) my spirit guides.
Sometimes, I'm offering thanks.  Sometimes, asking for guidance, help, or a
specific outcome for a situation.  Often the specific outcome request is more
in the form of an affirmation than a plea.  I expect the results I ask for (or
affirm that I am receiving).  And I get them  =)

Why is this even a question? I mean, it's not like it's some deep dark mystery
or something. I'm pretty sure most religions pray for the same basic reasons.
Except for me. I pray because I want to see Great Cthulhu rise, and because he
told me that if I don't, he'll blast my mind into gibbering insanity. Yeah,
rock on.

Oh no wait, I pray for pretty much the same reasons MK gave, if not in the same
way. Actually, my prayers tend to be less about asking for stuff, and more
about acknowledging or communicating with the universe. But then, as an animist
into music, what can you expect really? But I mean, yeah, Christians are
thankful to their god, I'm thankful to my gods. I get nice days and cloudy days
and warm days and cold days, and every morning I wake up, I'm still alive. I've
got people I love around me. It's a nice deal, so be thankful, even if it's not
to a god or gods. Seems pretty simple.

Best Reddit post of the week.

Quoting the post:

===========

Hey guys.

Me and some friends of mine are thinking about going deep in the woods
of the Southern United States to have some beer and smoke some
weed. It's pretty deep in there but I think there will be some
hillbilly folk that will be able to hear us.

What I want to do is use the preliminary evocation of the Goetia to
summon a Sasquatch so that he may pass on his wood lore to me. I have
some questions though.

1) Would the Goetia be appropriate for summoning a Sasquatch.

2) Is it really a good idea to go out in the middle of the woods at
night and possibly get shot by a hillbilly for worshiping the devil?

3) What is your experience with Sasquatch.

I have also grown interested in using Cherokee Indian arrowheads as
dream talismans and would be open to using Native American belief
systems for raising a Sasquatch. Holla at me.

   "Summon a sasquatch?"  The first thing I'd try is calling out "Here,
sasquatch!" and see how that works.
   The guy doesn't seem quite clear on whether the sasquatch is a real beast,
or a sort of magical phantom.  I mean, try inserting the words "ghost of a" in
front of "sasquatch" and see if it doesn't make at least as much, if not more
sense.
   Who says that sasquatches have any "woodlore"?  Wouldn't you get your
woodlore just as easily from some of these mountain men as from the (ghost of
a) sasquatch?  And just how much are you going to be able to learn while drunk
and high on marijuana?  Or does "lore" not really mean "learning", but rather
some ineffable "force" that you would absorb even better while stoned?
   And last, aren't sasquatches reported from the Pacific northwest, not from
the deep South?

    I don't know if this is of any interest, but I just found the following
Neo-Latin names for the Major Arcana of the Tarot, attributed to one Senftleben
in the early 17th century.  The order and the names are slightly altered from
what is now considered traditional.
Stultus (=The Fool)
I. Minimus (=The Magician/Mountebank) literally "the least", I suppose because
it is the lowest-valued card.
II. Imperatrix (=The Empress)
III. Imperator (=The Emperor)
IV. Papissa (=The High Priestess) literally "the Popess"
V. Summus Pontifex (=The Hierophant): "Highest Pontiff"
VI. Temperantia (=Temperance)
VII. Currus (=The Chariot)
VIII. Amor (=The Lovers): "Love"
IX. Propugnaculum (=Strength): "Defense"
X. Rota Fortunae (=Wheel of Fortune)
XI. Senex (=The Hermit) "Old Man"
XII. Patibulum (=The Hanged Man) "Gallows"
XIII. Mors (=Death)
XIV. Diabolus (=The Devil)
XV. Ignis (=The Tower) "Fire"
XVI. Stella (=The Star)
XVII. Luna (=The Moon)
XVIII. Sol (=The Sun)
XIX. Angelus (=Judgement) "Angel"
XX. Justicia (=Justice)
XXI. Mundus (=The World)
   This particular order seems to go back at least to the mid-16th century.

   It should be easy for a competent antiques dealer to determine its date
simply from the design.  In addition to keeping it out of sunlight, you will
want to keep it in a very dry place (to avoid damage from moisture and mildew)
make sure there are no small insects on it (any kind of paper can be food to
all sorts of tiny bugs) and keep it in a sealed container to keep insects from
getting at it.  Depending on the age, it might be of interest to a museum; if
it's 18th century or later, there are probably many extant copies (though it's
possible that yours is a rare deck) and it will either be something that you
can sell on the antiques market or something that you can keep and enjoy
looking at from time to time.  As Faunus said, making a visual record of it for
its artistic and historical value would also be a contribution.

Happy Midvinterblot!  Have a cool painting of an apocrphyal pagan
ritual.

(copying the text here....)

Midvinterblot

Good Winter Solstice to you. To those of you in the Northern
Hemisphere, may your daylight grow longer and warmer.

This painting, by Carl Larsson, showing a Winter Solstice sacrifice,
was intended for the Stockholm National Museum. It was meant to
present a winter motif from heathen times, and was named Midvinterblot
-- 'blot' being an ancient term for a sacrificial ceremony.

The artist explained: "Here a king is being sacrificed for the weal of
the people (to ensure a good harvest year). He was drowned in the
sacred well at the root of the tree . . ."

The idea of the sacrifice appealed to Larsson--showing a king who
tosses his furs aside and in nakedness stands ready to die voluntarily
for the good of his people.

The problem was that no such event was to be found recorded in any
historical resource, causing the painting to be a source of negative
controversy.

Seriously, though, what *is* it with the reconstructionists?  You'd think I'd
be hardcore leg-humping into what they're doing (not the Nazi twits, of course,

penchant for peer review, I simply cannot find much in this approach to appeal
to me.  It seems more like LARPing, not matter how seriously they take it.
It's almost like fetishizing the past.

I wonder if it's a theoretical issue.  The meaning and structure of classical
religion was built into the social assumptions and cultural values of Greece
and rome, and we have a *very* different culture.  To try to "reconstruct" just
the religious part is a bit reductionist, and perhaps that's the cause of my
unease.

I would much rather hang out with a Christo-Wiccan who honors Hekate and Shiva

There's this group, or was anyway, something about Theodish. They sold an

CD, but they totally tried to have this SCA-esc thing going where Theofrith
Gundarson or who the hell ever was the cyning and you swore an oath to him and
.... whatever. Not to get the CD of course, but I mean to be part of the
religion.

It makes me think of the ISKCON. I was considering looking into them because I
dig a chunk of their message and I totally thought it would be cool to learn
some chanting, I have an excellent CD of somebody chanting bits of the Vedas
and other stuff. I hit vegetarianism, and celibacy in particular, and went
"nope, not for me at all". So there's just a lot of that. Not that ISKCON is
anywhere in the same realm as the crazy Helenic reconstructionist, but you get

social than spiritual.  Still, it is a problem with paganism, this lack of
fellowship.

"Still, it is a problem with paganism, this lack of fellowship."

I couldn't possibly agree more.  Tis part of what drew me to the metaphysical
church I joined.  Weekly gatherings of like-minded people, intellectual
discussion on a wide variety of topics (including religion and spirituality), a
group with disparate beliefs worshiping together anyway, and (can't be
understated) food afterwards.  (*winks*)

I now live in the bible belt, and have yet to find anything even remotely close
to the feeling of welcome and belonging I had at the metaphysical church.

Well, to explain, I have to give you a bit of background.

I grew up in a very staid methodist church.  I'm a parochial school graduate.
I found Wicca in my mid-20s, and it made way, WAY more sense to me than
anything I'd learned about to that point.

When I first got involved with the metaphysical church (UMC), it was through
their classes.  I wanted nothing to do with anything that occurred on Sundays,
because that was too churchy.  I did get drafted into the "choir," a small
chorus that sang for the Christmas Eve services.  But that was as close to
"churchy" as I was willing to get.

Then I moved to a new area, and wanted to find friends, like, RIGHT NOW.  I
tracked down the UMC branch there, and wanted to get involved immediately, so I
decided tha tmaybe "churchy" was ok.  My first experience there was Sunday
School and the Sunday morning service.  I immediately felt at home there.  In
the year I was there, I became an usher, joined the choir, helped with
fellowship, volunteered for fundraising events, sang several solos, and was
even paid to play the piano for evening services a few times a month.  It was
family, and it was home.

Fast forward to the most recent move.  I wanted to find that home, that family,
that sense of belonging.  Figured the UUs would be the best place to find that
in the bible belt.  I went to a Sunday morning service within a few weeks of
moving here.  It was like a gaggle of complete strangers with absolutely
nothing in common who happened to wander into the same place at the same time
all decided to sit down and watch a play (no sermon, just a play), listen to
readings from the Buddha and Muhammed, and sing a couple songs about the
goddess and Jesus.  There was no cohesion, no feeling of community.  It felt
like somebody said "We have to include ALL THE RELIGIONS!!!!!"  And while I
understand that that's kinda what the UUs do, it felt very slapdash and
haphazard the way they did it.

From wikipedia (since I just plain didn't know): Unitarian Universalism is a
theologically liberal religion characterized by support for a "free and
responsible search for truth and meaning".[1] Unitarian Universalists do not
share a creed; rather, they are unified by their shared search for spiritual
growth and by the understanding that an individual's theology is a result of
that search and not obedience to an authoritarian requirement. Unitarian
Universalists draw on many different theological sources and have a wide range
of beliefs and practices.


UMCs DO share a creed; it can be found at

I see they adopt the standard conservative new age view. i.e. I find principle
four to be incredibly pernicious. A neat trick is to bring up something
everybody considers tragic, say, a 4 Yo with inoprable and painful liver
cancer. You'll get one of two responses. They'll either hem and haw a bit and
then kind of ignore it, or they'll start telling you about how, before she got
incarnated, her soul totally chose that for "a learning experience", or even
better, that her soul chose that to teach you and all the other people who
encounter her, something or other, they're never quite clear on just what it is
she's supposed to be learning/teaching from dying in agony. Do you have money
problems? Good news! Just like Mitt Romney, they consider you to be a lazy fuck
who's not taking responsibility for your life. Fun times.

I think principle four is the big reason I can't really get into the new
thought movements. On the one hand, it's kind of positive, it's that typical
"anybody can do anything, try it"! Except, you know, I'm not sure "anybody can
do anything" is really true. So for instance, if like me you're blind, you'll
either get people telling you it's awesome because you chose that to learn,
which I don't particularly have a problem with, or like some Evangelical
Christians about praying, that if you just thought the right way, you could
like, totally see again.

Which is the nasty flipside of "you can do anything"! If you aren't doing
whatever it is, it's only because you haven't worked hard enough/thought the
right way/visualized the right thing/aren't positive enough/Etc. It's like
saying "it sure does suck that your whole family got crushed to death in that
car accident Jimmy, but it's all part of 'God's plan'". That's basically what
principle four amounts to, that same kind of platitude. Except it might even be
worse, because at least if it's "God's plan", there's not a lot you can do
about it. In this case, you, or your family, could TOTALLY do something about
it, you just chose not to.

I should add I'm not trying to pick on MK or her church. Quite a few versions
of the new thought/new age/metaphysics thing adopt this, maybe all of them, for
instance my step father is totally into it and reads everything from the
Aquarian Gospels to Esther Hicks and he totally believes this. So it's
pretty widely distributed throughout the literature. It's just one of those
things that I think people don't really consider the implications of, and it's
always kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I totally get the positive aspect, how
it can give you hope that you might actually be able to do something useful. I
just think there's a negative side, and while people might try to be nice about
expressing it, it's really not a particularly nice message at all.

how we react to that: either rejoice in the time you have left, or abandon

That could be, but I've been around a fair number of people who believe this
due to my step father, and they really do take it as, "are you having financial
troubles? That's because you're thinking like a poor person". My step father,
for instance, always says you attract what you're thinking about, so if you say
you want to be rich, but really you have doubt and you're thinking "oh that
probably couldn't happen to me", then it won't, because the universe is giving
you exactly what you want, and what you REALLY want is to be poor. Otherwise,
you'd get rid of those doubts and think all positive and shit, and then the
universe would give you that.

Now, it totally could be that they understand things the way you say, but
looking at it, I again have to ocnfess some doubt. FOr instance:  "We belileve
in personal responsibility & that we create our own happiness or unhappiness as
we live in harmony or discord with natural physical and spiritual
laws." This totally looks to me like "well of course the baseball gave you a
concussion Jimmy, that's what happens if you throw it up as hard as you can and
stand underneath it when it comes back down, it hits you in the head"! To
continue:

Ignorance is no excuse of the law! That refers to the spiritual law as well. As
long as we are ignorant or indifferent to the spiritual laws of the universe
we will continue to create the negative and suffer the results.)

Now I don't know what these people believe are the "spiritual laws", but
assuming it's much like "The Secret" with the law of attraction and such, it's
literally saying you're creating your own problems, if you're in pain it's
because you don't know the spiritual laws of attracting health, so of course
you'll be unhealthy. That's actually pretty standard stuff, so it would
surprise me if they believed something radically different. I can't find any
discussion of "spiritual laws" right off, maybe somebody can point me to one.

Interesting, OK, I think I get the distinction. UMC says you create "your own
happiness". Most of the things I see claim that you literally create your own
reality. It seems a bit odd not to say "depending on how you react to
situations", if that's what they meant, as opposed to all the stuff about
following spiritual laws. If my arm gets broken and I'm optimistic and not
complaining, I'm not quite sure how that's following a law, and being grumpy
Etc. would be not following it. In any case, with apologies to UMC and MK for
getting their beliefs wrong, what I described is fairly accurate for the "you
create your own reality" folks. I absolutely agree about your reactions
creating your happiness, well, at least largely so. I'd make the distinction
that I don't think your reactions are ever perfectly under your control, but as
long as that's understood, sure, it seems pretty obvious that you can react in
various ways, and some of those will make you happier than others.

While there is some of the "You're poor because you think like a poor person"
and "if you just thought about being healthy hard enough and/or the right way,
you'd be healthy" in the UMC, that is absolutely not the prevailing message by
any means.  (I'll put it this way: when I was very poor and in very lousy
health, one person suggested that I should "visualize wealth coming to you, and
it will!"  Everyone else's suggestions and advice was much more useful.)

It is very much about your attitude about things tha happen.  One of the
pastors told me once that sometimes life sucks, and all we can do about it is
control our reactions.  And he admitted that that was often not an easy thing
to do.

An example:  I have chronic pain issues that often result in a loss of
mobility.  Sometimes the fact that I have to use a walker and braces to very
slowly and painfully get around is irrelevant; I have to go out and get things
done.  Strangers look at me funny, since I'm in my early 30s and have been
accused of being in my mid-20s, and ask nosy questions about how I'm doing,
what's wrong with me, and if they can help with anything.  My responses are
always the same:  I'm great, old age, and no thanks, I've got it!  Then come
the comments on my attitude.  My response is, again, always the same:  I can
either be in a lot of pain, and having trouble walking, and be miserable; or I
can be in a lot of pain, and having trouble walking, and be happy.  Either way,
I'm still in a lot of pain, and having trouble walking.  I choose to be happy.

More accurate to say would be that I choose to act like I'm happy.  I've found
over the years that "fake it til you make it" is a valid tactic.  Not always
easy to just ACT happy, much less be happy....but I believe that it's worth the
effort.

And being pagan and knowing the effectiveness of magic, sure, you can
absolutely change a fair bit of stuff. But there are some things that you
can't, and then the whole "you create your reality" thing, which "your

In the same vein, when my dad refers to me as "gimpy" or threatens to change my

Well, just thought I would post an update on things.  Helps me let some of this
out so I appreciate anything people want to post about it.

So about 3.5 weeks ago, I told my wife I wanted out and I got tears and sobbing
and how she wanted to work on it.  Since then we have had several conversatoins
and I am definitely seeing why her and I don't work together well.  While we
talk, we don't actually communicate.  This has been the major source of our
issues for a long time.  We both are guilty of it so there can't be
fingerpointing at just one person.

I posted about her wanting "me" time and how I didn't do enough around the
house.  The interesting thing is the "me" time issue keeps getting switched
around.  Not long after that conversation, she then changed her story to "I
want family time and what is what I meant by 'me' time" to which I replied "If
that is what you meant, you should have said it because those two mean two very
different things."  Well she recently changed it again as of two days ago to
where she said "me" time meant that she is just around the kids way too much. 
She has implied multiple time of me not doing enough around the house (and to
this I find funny becuase most people that know me know what all I do and their
wives would kill to have a husband that does the things that I do *laugh*).

She admitted she has been trying to change and another of my complaints was
just doing hte housework together.  Any time I start cleaning, she gets mad
because she says that there is something else she would rather be doing.  I
feel the same way but if I don't clean, it doesn't get clean.  I have asked her
to change her cleaning a little because (and she admits this) growing up, she
had to clean very little because her house was so full of stuff.  So clean
baseboards, the tops of doors, the webs out of corners, etc. just doesn't cross
her mind.  Well we talked about that some and she again said that was just how
she was raised.  My response was "Okay, but we have been married 15 years and
you lived at home for 18 years.  So you are telling me after 15 years, you
can't change?"  I agree it was an argumentative statement but it is just the
desire to not change.  I grew up in a minimalist household so I have had to get
used to A LOT more stuff in my opinion around the house and I have done that
because that is how she lives.

Another thing we talked about was setting an example for the kids by doing what
you tell them to do.  Example was going to out to eat and we always make the
kids say "please" after they order their drink.  I think that as the parents we
should do the same thing.  My wife just won't do it.  And she admits she won't
do it.  I don't get it...

Another thing was when my brother and SIL come over, my wife refuses to say hi
or acknowledge them for at least 15 minutes.  I have asked her to say hi
multiple times, my family asks why she wont say hi, my brother asks if he has
pissed her off or something, etc.  As I told her, I am not asking for her to
like them or anything but just a common courtesy of acknowledgement and setting
a good example for the kids.  My wife feels she doesn't need to say hi to them
because they can just knock and come in.  But I reminded her that she says hi
to anyone else that walks in most of the time.  Then she said that she doesn't
like my brother because of entitlement issues that he has.  Again, like I told
her, that is fine but at least just say hi in front of the kids.  I am not
asking her to be nice or anything but at least be the bigger person then and
set a good example.

The funny thing is these are such small things in my opinion.  Low hanging
fruit that could easily be used to help the bigger picture long term but just
doing a few small things.                                            ^by

She doesn't talk to me much more than she did.  Nothing has really changed. 
She has offered up no ideas on how to fix our relationship even though she say
she wants to.  We basically talk to each other in front of hte kids and that is
it.

Funny thing is her reasoning for keeping our marriage together?  I quote her
"Well if my brother and SIL can stay married, we should be able to as well." 
WTF?  Their kids admit they shouldn't be married.  My BIL has a drinking
problem and two DUIs.  My SIL has ADHD and an assault charge against her for
beating him.  That is what she is basing success on?

What I have found is the words she is using are pretty much the same ones I am
using as to ending it.  She doesn't want to be together based on a lot of her
words and actions but the denial of ending is where we are currently.  I
realized after this last weekend that it needs to end for both of us.  I
believe she would be happier with some time to just herself without the kids
and definitely without me.  For me, I know i would be happier.  I have told her
that I want out and don't wnat to work on it but if a person believes that they
truly do want to try, sometimes you have to at least put forth some effort even
if you know you will fail just to feel like you tried something.  For her, no
effort.  I know many of you say she is depressed and I agree.  But the lack of
effort for anythign is just too much anymore.  I am glad I am headed in the
direction I am and in the long term, everyone will be happier.  At least I
believe I will be and the kdis will be.

Artemis> Yep, I clean the tops of doors.  *laugh*  Honestly though, I don't
expect my wife to do that.  I do expect her to at least rinse out the sink hte
sink in the morning after she coughs up a lung in it and then leaves it sit to
dry.  I do expect that if she misses the garbage can with trash to at least go
and pick it up and put it in the can.  Just like this morning, the dog puked on
the floor downstairs.  She obviously stepped in it and then smeared it on hte
floor because there was a footprint in it.  And she left it and went to work
and I had to clean it up this morning.

walk through the water and complain his socks are wet. He'll step in a dirt
pile while I'm clearly sweeping it up and think nothing of it until he stops to
ask why there are pieces of a chip on his sock. His awareness of the world
around him is very, very limited and teaching him how to expand it is very
hard. For most teens they think the world revolves around him. To my son, it's
almost literal and he doesn't understand why it's not true. it's a very strange
thing to deal with.

Just thought I would give an update for those following at home *laugh*

As many of your remember, I told my wife that I wanted out of our marriage
towards the middle of March and that some of the things we talked about didn't
make sense, etc.  Fast forward to the end of April....

Apparently she didn't believe anything I said because she wanted to go to the
park and just talk one evening (just the two of us).  So I agreed and I thought
it would be about the split.  Turns out, she was doing this to just talk.  I
reiterated that I was done with the relationship and that I was surprised that
we were having this conversation again.  Her response was "So you want out of
our marriage?" and I said "Yes."  She didn't really cry but got really angry
and told me about how horrible I was to her, how I treated her bad, etc.  I
decided that it wasn't worth arguing about because she wasn't rational about
it.

Move ahead about 1 week later to last Tuesday morning.  I am getting ready for
work and I just tell her that I may be late getting home from work because we
were doing an upgrade for a server.  She then just stops and asks me why I am
being nice to her at all anymore.  I tell her that I see no reason to be snotty
or mean about anything because there is no gain to it.  I tell her taht even
though the relationship between her and I doesn't work, we have two kids
together and need to be good parents still and that it would benefit them if we
were able to get along in a nice manner.  This leads into a longer deeper
conversation which was good to have.

She told me that over the last several years when I told her those things that
she agonized over them and tried to figure out what to do and she was mad taht
I thought she did nothing.  I said I can see her point but when I told her
those things that bothered me, what did she do?  She cried a little, walked
away, said nothing, and nothing changed.  Her argument this time was she was
thinking about what to do.  I responded with "How would I know that if you dont
communicate that to me?  Add in that I didn't see any changes and you didn't
say you were doing anyting or even a simple 'Hey let me think on this a second'
comment.  Your actions showed you did nothing."

She sat there for a bit and then agreed that she saw my point and that she
didn't take into account that unless she told me something, how would i know
anything.  I again told her that communication was our worst trait for our
relationship and she agreed.  I told her without communication there was no way
our relationship to get fixed never the less to succeed.  Her response was that
she never really communicated that much even as a kid so this is all new ot
her.  That comment made me a little frustrated because I told her that it
doesn't matter how you think you have been for everyone else.  It matter how
you are with me and if you don't wnat to communicate with anyone else, that is
fine, but to work with me in this relationship it isn't optional...it is a
must.

She then said that she had an appointment with a counselor for herself only
because she needed to herself in order and I told her that was great that she
was doing that.  I also told her that is a little disappointing that it took me
saying that I was leaving the relationship in order for her to make this change
so I wasn't sure if she was doing it for herself or to "please" me and I told
her that I was hoping she was doing it for herself first.  I honestly don't
know if she made the appointment or not because last Thursday she sent me an
email saying we needed to see a marriage counselor and I said I would go but I
would tell the person the same things I have told her.  When I asked why she
didn't do this over the last several years when I said there were problems the
answer I got was "I don't know."

So here are where things are and I don't understand how this is better but it
follows her pattern to a "T" as to what she does with things:

- Communication: the same or less and it just depends on the day.  She doesn't
  really want to be around me and I don't really want to be around her so
  neither of us say anything to the other really unless the kids are around.

- Depression: I think this has hit her hard.  She doesn't watch TV anymore at
  all at night.  She just helps put the kids to bed and then usually just goes
  to bed about 30 minutes after they do.  She used to stay up watching TV until
  10:30 pm and catching up on her shows but she has stopped recording most
  things and she is asleep at 9:30 pm or earlier usually.

- Sex: Well this was cut off back in March.  While I understand the lack of
  interest, I don't get how things can get better if she chooses to make things
  a lot worse.  Then again, this is how she does it...things get way worse and
  then they get a little better (not back up to where they were) and she claims
  she is working on it.  Where I wanted us to be was way further than we were
  before I said I wanted out and I just don't see how she can get there.

- Keeping things clean and picked up: Same as before...sometimes worse
  depending on the day.

I guess I don't understand how she can tell me that she wants things to work
out and yet the problems that we have she is deliberating making them worse by
not putting any energy into them.  It is almost like she is emotionally checked
out but the words keep coming out of her mouth.  I do know she has told a few
people that we are having problems so I guess admitting to it is the first
step.

MMM> My bad on that.  I thought I put in other information.  So back in March
when I told her I wanted out, I didn't say I wanted a divorce but I made it
clear that I had had enough.  We discussed things that were problems and she
said she wanted to work on it.  I informed her that I was willing to give it a
try but she needed to understand that I was working on it from a different
position as her.

So we discussed the things that needed work such as communication, sex, etc.  I
also informed her that she had to be the one that showed something this time
and not me and that I was going to take on her role for a bit and just let her
come to me.  She never did.  In fact, all the things that we talked about
turned out much worse...less communication, completely no sex (yet she
complained about how that there was no intimacy so I told her that she had to
try and not expect me to lead all the time), things got messier around the
house, etc.

That is when I told her that it needed to end.  Then she "really" wanted to
work on it.  It was really odd...

Been gone for a while on here.  Working on stuff at home...woo hoo.

About my post and me being irritated about the lack of sex...that is totally by
(my) bad.  I was just frustrated with everything and I know that my
expectations on that were completely stupid on all levels.  I realize now I was
just looking for something to complain about when it came to her and what she
was doing was well within what she should be doing which I realize now.  Damn,
working through something like this really plays with one's emotions and I hate
it.

Well, she did go see some professional help finally on May 25.  I asked her how
it went and I got the usual "fine" and then nothing else.  I am not expecting
her to tell me what they talked about but I have tried to be open with her
about what I talked about when I went to see the person I am seeing to some
level.  I figure just try to keep things open and honest.

I know for some this is confusing as to why it may seem like I am trying to fix
it when I don't want to fix it.  For me, I don't want to be a raging asshole
about the whole deal.  I don't see a point.  It is much better for her and I to
at least be on decent speaking terms versus at each others' throats especially
when it comes to the kids.  I know some of this is hard and some of it isn't
fun nor nice but I just don't want to jsut be mad and frustrated the whole time
either...it isn't good for anyone.

Anyway, things at home are back to "normal".  We don't speak at all hardly and
after the kids go to bed, she does her thing and I do mine.  I am going to let
it be for a bit because I get tired to arguing but at some point something has
to give.  She keeps reading books about how to fix the marriage.  Unfortunately
what she hasn't realized yet (and I hvae told her many many times) is that you
can't fix something that involves two people when only one person is on board.

Actually I have been working with a professional for some time now.  It still
plays with the mind but not as much.  It is a matter of just keeping things in
perspective and making sure you don't get completely wrapped up in all the
negative crap that goes with it.

Right now, for her, I think it is still just denial.  No matter what I say
about it or anything, she just acts like everything is okay.  It is strange but
yet it is how she handles most problems.  She prefers to just close off the
world and close her eyes and if she doesn't see it, then the problem really
isn't there.  That is why we are in this situation now was because I was trying
to involve her in helping make our relationship better with good communication
and she just said nothing.

One thing that the professional and I talked about was the one thing that
really is driving all of this (me wanting out) and it is her lack of
motivation.  I am not sure why she has so little motiviation but it is
interesting because she does.  She also has some really odd expectations in
that she wants a 100% return on most anything that involves her but she doesn't
want to put 100% into it either and definitley never more than 100%.  When I
look at her whole family, that is how they all are but ultimately I only have
to deal with her but it is interesting that those traits are so strong that it
is hard to break away from them even though you know it is killing your
relationship.

The one thing that she has started now is that if she doesn't like to hear what
I am saying, she will just disappear for several hours.  She doesn't go in her
car or anything but just takes her cell phone and says nothing to anyone and
just goes away.  When I try to call because I may need something for the kids
or the kids want to do something and include her, she doesn't answer and
doesn't respond to text messages or anything.  I am not sure what she is doing
but it makes it kinda hard when you aren't sure if someone is going to be
around or not.

In the end, I know that her and I won't be friends but at the same time, I do
want us to at least be able to communicate about the kids without a fight.  I
don't think that is unreasonable...

Just using this to just voice things...

So last Friday, I approached my wife about things again.  Her and I hadn't
spoken for nearly a week other than just idle chat or one could even refer to
it as just business like talk.  I started it off my immediately explaining that
I was not there to fight but just to talk and we both just needed to keep an
open mind when each other spoke and not immediately jump to a negative
conclusion.  She agreed.

I asked how she felt she was fixing things currently because I wasn't seeing
anything from my point of view.  She said she wasn't sure what to do or
anything.  I then added that it has become obvious that we don't even like to
be around each other and she agreed (we went out with some friends the next
night and my buddy told me on Monday it was very clear that her and I are just
not on the same page).  I also added that I hadn't changed my mind on wanting
out of the relationship and she said she understood it.  I then asked if she
had any questions for me.

She asked me for a list of all the problems that I see currently.  I told that
it was a bit surprising to me to have her ask me that since we have talked
about it repeatedly over the years, but I would lay things out for her.  I told
her about several things and I reminded her that wasn't all of them but I
wanted to keep the list to a level that was workable right now.

- First for me was one of just putting stuff away.  She agreed she is terrible
at it but then immediately said that was how she was raised.  I told her I
understood that but people can change if and when they are ready to do so and
this was, to me, an easy victory.  I gave her several examples of things that I
had seen and she agreed she did it.  She didn't agree to change it.

- The next was her complaint of me not listening.  Again, I told her it was a
lead by example situation.  I had seen many times where our son would be
telling her something and she would just tune him out and he knows it.  Then
she gets irritated and why he doesn't listen.  I told her that when she talks
to her brothers, mom, or our friends and I ask how things are and what is new,
I always got the "Well I really wasn't listening so I don't know" answer.  I
explained that she really couldn't be mad at others for not giving 100% to
listening when she makes a point of not doing it...which lead me to the 3rd
thing:

- Effort.  I told her that she isn't really willing to give 100% to anything
but has no problems complaining if she isn't getting 100% from someone else.  I
gave her multiple examples of this and even showed her how she complained about
her own family when they do it to her but she has no problems doing it right
back.  As I explained to her, she has never been willing to give 100% to
anything in our relationship and over the years I stopped caring so there just
wasn't enough to go around.  She didn't disagree.

I did get a few tears and she fully admitted that once she walks into the same
room with me she just clams up.  I told her that communication is hard when the
person you are talking to doesn't want to talk and shows no interest in the
other person.  She agreed with that.

Then she threw out this kicker: She said that she really wasn't willing to
change anything right now because it is all comfortable.  I shrugged my
shoulders and said okay.  Not sure what else to say to that.  Her inability to
work with me and find common ground between us and both make sacrifices is what
has doomed the relationship.  I am not perfect and I know that I could
definitely change in some areas as well to help out with stuff.  As I told her
(and she agreed), anytime I made a change she seemed like she stuck to her guns
more and even tried less to make a change.  I told her that I was tired of
feeling like the only person giving to the relationship and she was always
taking.  Again she agreed and even said that it just feels like it used to but
we even talk less now.

The good news for me is she is on a work trip from this last Monday until
Sunday.  It is just me and the boys.  I sleep better, I feel better, I am not
nervous, I am getting stuff done, and I am just genuinely happier without her
there and it makes me a little sad that this is what it has become.  I have
also noticed that I don't have the fights at night with the kids getting them
to bed and such.  She called two nights ago to say goodnight to the boys but
her and I didn't talk and the same thing last night as well.  Neither of us
really want to talk to the other and we have both openly admitted to it.

The problem is two things need to happen for things to work...

1. Both people need to want to make it work.  This is where I am not on board
and basically because I have just checked out.  She is on board because she
doesn't want to lose the comfort of me just being a warm body around the house.

2. Both people have to be willing to change more and do more than they ever
have before to make it work.  I have no problems with effort and change (my job
changes daily it seems like *laugh*) but this is where she isn't willing to
bend.

It just seems like she is reading all these "saving a marriage" books and just
blindly throwing stuff to see if anything sticks but it is only the stuff that
doesn't require any effort out of her.  For me, I am done and have repeated
that I am done...

Kansas isn't really nice as far as divorces go for guys.  Financially she could

I would rather that she and I could work through this together and come to a
solution where she still gains but I don't get crushed either.  Since I make
2/3rds of our total income and if she decides to just be a b**** about it, I
could be seriously hurting.

I would rather take a few more weeks or whatever and work on getting her used

I've never been through a divorce, but I've been around them.  And one thing
that seems pretty common is that whoever files gets the upper hand.  Putting it
off while making it clear that this is what you want will only give her more
time to file first.

She could ruin you whether you do it now or six months from now.  The courts
always decide, whether it's now or later, if she decides to be a bitch.  If you
think the chances of her being a bitch later are less than now, I'm not sure
you're thinking this through all that clearly (no offense).

If she's "comfortable" in this situation, you're going to be pulling the rug
out from under her when you file (or she files), whenever that is.

If you get custody of the kids she'll have a harder time making extra financial

is her to file and make claims that aren't true, or whatever. At least if you
do it now you get to tell your side of the story first. Agreeable divorces
certainly can happen. My parents divorced when I was 15 and my sister was 12.
best thing they could have done. They works out all the details themselves,
only had the court to do the legal divorce business. That said, my mom did get
screwed on child support, but it was what she agreed to in exchange for keeping
the house (which was paid off), so in the end it all came out ok and everyone
was for the better.

Actually, if both parties agree, one attorney can be used for both.  Basically
all the attorney is doing is filing the paperwork and helping to get some stuff
figured out but nothing more.  At least that is true in the state I live in and
it could be different within different states.

I know some of you are doing the face-palm on my situation on why I haven't
filed yet and I still have my reason in that I would just like to see if she
can be more on board on some stuff.  I figure I know her decently and can tell
if she is going to get on board or not.

At the same time, I know it has to end sooner or later.  We are just limping
along on this and I believe we both realize that it is getting messy at this
point.  We both admitted to each other that we don't like to be around each
other.  I have told her I want out.  She has said that she is comfortable just
staying the way she is and isn't wanting to change.

About 2 months ago, she said we needed to see a marriage consultant.  I said
that was fine and told her that I would tell that person the same thing I told
her which is I wanted out.  So far, she has gone by herself to see this person.
She doesn't tell me what is going on or anything and if I ask how things are
going, all I get back is a one word answer of "fine".

What I am hoping is based on her actions, she knows the end is coming and she
is going to this person to help her through this transition which is why she
isn't saying much to me and why we haven't gone to this person together at any
point.  It is hard to say though.  To her, doing nothing is the best option
most of the time...

I just finalized a divorce that was pretty amicable, so yes it can be done, but
it was nerve wracking as all hell.  The one thing that I think you need to be
absolute on is: DO NOT MOVE OUT!!  As a man, you already have the losing hand
when it comes to the kids.  About the only equalizer in that situation is that
if you stay in the house then you have the children's home.  Oh, and do
whatever you have to to maintain a minimum of 50% custody if there is a
separation of some kind.  I was separated for a couple of years before filing
because I wanted a nice long track record of stable 50/50 custody before I went
before a judge.  Every other weekend and one evening per week wasn't cool with
me.

Oh, and while I wholeheartedly agree that you should consult with an attorney,
I personally, would avoid hiring one to represent you until you know she's
going to.  If you can work out the details yourselves and get it done without
her getting an attorney involved, it's way worth it.

So things continue to be interesting.

My wife continues to check out books about how to fix a marriage, etc. but then
leaves them on the dining room table for me to see but based on what I am
seeing, she isn't reading them.

We don't really talk at all other than about the kids.  We don't fight either;
we more or less just exist in the same area.

She hasn't mentioned "working" on the relationship in a while.

Our son is spending the week with my parents and my brother's family and we are
supposed to pick him up this Sunday.  My wife dropped him off at my brother's
house and made the comment to my brother and his wife that I would pick my our
son on Sunday and that she "would not be coming along at all."  Normally that
wouldn't seem like anything to most people but apparently it was said in such a
way that my brother and his wife really questioned it (they don't know about
the sitaution between my wife and I).

She has been writing stuff in a notebook about me for several weeks now and has
multiple pages of stuff.  It contains everything from how she can't take it
anymore to how I treat her like shit to how I cheated on her with an emotional
affair.  Obviously this has been stored away in her mind for a while...

So I asked her about the stuff she wrote and she said that a book told her to
vent her feelings in writing and so I took a look at the book.  She is correct
that it did but apparently she didn't read the rest of it or decided that she
didn't want to do the other part because the other part was after the comment
or complaint to write what I could do to participate in fixing and what she
could do to participate in helping fix it and find a solution.

fun stuff...I think though she is seeing that it is over and we will be able to
move on soon.

This isn't really a love question, exactly, but more of a friendship question.
I'm thinking it's about time to move away from a "roller-coaster" kind of
friendship that I've had with someone for the past year or so. We were pretty
tight for awhile, but it's been not exactly great for me.  We used to talk via
email or gchat often throughout the week and text from time to time.  I've
stopped emailing and pretty much only contact him now regarding standing events
that we are both attending (we play cards about once a month or so).  I don't
have much of a desire to see him in person either, but since we have several
mutual friends, avoiding social situations isn't exactly feasible or
desireable.
I think he's picked up on the fact that I haven't been as chatty and we haven't
been as close as we were, but I think he chalks it up to me being busy. If he
asks me why we don't talk or hang out as much anymore, what should I say? I
don't want to get into a big discussion about it. I'm tempted to give him the
"I'm busy" line again.

I think there's lweeway involved in ending friendships that isn't allowed in
ending a romantic relationship.  Just stay "busy," and the friendship will
peter out.  If he was your SO, you'd owe him an explanation, some indication of
where things went wrong.  But there's nothing to be gained by either party by
employing brute honesty ("I really have no desire to see you socially, and your
e-mails and texts annoy me.")  He'll either get the drift, or go with human
nature and assume you're just a bitch (I don't think you are - just saying,
that might be the conclusion he comes to; however, even if you gave him an
explanation, he might think you're just being a bitch).

Sometimes it's okay to just let someone fade out of your life.  I've had
numerous friendships end where we just outgrew each other, and there were no
hard feelings, no obsession about where things went wrong, etc.  Sometimes it
just happens.

I actually disagree with that. I had a friend, someone who'd been a close
friend for probably a decade, pull exactly that stunt recently. Now, we both
really had gone through periods of being too busy to get together much over the
years, so I didn't immediately assume she was avoiding me when she spent much
of the past six months claiming to be too busy to see me. So when she suddenly
dropped me from a bunch of social networking sites and I confronted her about
it, I was really hurt to learn she'd made this decision so long ago and not
told me, so that I felt really foolish thinking we were still friends and
treating her exactly the same the few times we'd seen each other. It upsets me
enough that I'm really not interested in trying to fix the friendship with her,
and so now it looks like we'll never talk again over something that's probably
relatively stupid, but her reaction really offended me (just, as, apparently my
reaction to a conflict with a mutual friend offended her enough to start all
this in the first place).

I can see an argument for treating a recent relationship, romantic or
otherwise, differently than a longer-lived one. But I'm not sure I agree that I
deserved less of an explanation from my ex-friend (or less of a chance to
discuss and possibly fix the issues) than some guy one of us might have dated
for a month or two. On the other hand, longevity is not necessarily the best
way to judge a relationship, either. In the end, only the people in the
relationship will probably be able to judge what sort of relationship it is,
and thus, the proper way to end it.

I do not see the difference between a romance and friendship in terms of ending
it.  If it is someone you been friends with for a while they deserve to have an
answer.  To me saying "too busy" is not the best way to approach it.  Sure life
happens but at some point the person will want to hang out again.  Letting them
know you want to cease the friendship gives it closure.  Think about it, then
you don't have to keep coming up with excuses of why you are so busy.

I don't think it would be healthy for either person, to just ignore them so
long until they disappear. It hurts to be ignored by someone you care about and
that you assume cares for you, even if they are wrong. It seems like the
cowards way out, to me. yes, friendships grow apart, but that's something that
happens naturally. That's not the case here, when one person wants out. Of
course, just contacting someone to say "I don't want to be friends with you
anymore" is going to hurt, too. But perhaps instead of taking that route, you
can be honest and say look, I like A B and C about you, but this X Y and Z
stuff bothers me, and I'd like to try to work it out into somethin that workds
for both of us, before it ruins our friendship."

If you like the person at all, then I'd think you can find something to work
out that'll be mutually beneficial. If you really don't like a thing about them
and never want to see them again, at least say something. Tell them you are
doing a major life overhaul and need your space and privacy, or whatever. But
don't just pretend they don't exist when they think you are friends. It sucks.

To clarify:
This friend and I have never dated, as I am married.  He is single.  We've been
friends for about a year, but close friends for about 6-7 months.  We were very
close for awhile - talking online every day, hanging out a couple times a week
in either groups or one on one.  I backed off from that because I felt like he
was beginning to develop a crush on me, which he confirmed.  He told me he
could keep it under control, since he also had crushes on other women. He was
planning on pursuing those, and I figured if any of those worked out for him,
he'd sort of forget about any romantic feelings towards me.  He was able to
keep things under control for awhile, until early last April when he drunkenly
made a pass at me.  I almost ended the friendship at that time, but he seemed
pretty contrite and wanted very much to put the incident behind us and move
forward.  After some consideration, I decided to go that route, as we have many
mutual friends and I did enjoy his company.
-
Now I no longer enjoy his company. A few things have to do with him, his
actions recently and his personality. Some of it has to do with me and my
tolerance/patience level.  I've stopped emailing him and rarely text without a
specific purpose (nothing chatty or "just to say hi").

He is not good with confrontation. He is also pretty self-centered, so he may
not even notice that I'm not as friendly as I once was.  If he has noticed,
he's not mentioning it right now.

Simple way to solve that problem is tell him that you want to focus your energy

Next time he wants to hang out or whatever let him know you want to focus on
your marriage.  Easy solution.  I wouldn't ignore it though by saying "I'm

Call me Freaked
Similar to Karma and I have enjoyed reading her situation. I am very married,
very monogamous, and very in love with my husband. This fellow, Bob, is a work
colleague. He and I had similar jobs that were rather unique from other jobs,
so we were able to share experiences and strategies for success. We've worked
together for roughly 6 years and been friends through that. He and his wife and
my husband and I have had dinner on several occasions. Bob and his wife moved
to London, still with the company, a year ago. We keep in touch through work as
sometimes our work touches each other's world. He was in town and we caught up
over dinner.
And this is where I got freaked.
I knew he had been dealing with depression and had seriously contemplated, and
even started acting on suicide on several occasions over the past couple of
years.
As I asked him how he was doing, how therapy was going, etc, he shared that
little bit too much. That he had an affair with somebody in his organization.
But quickly reassured me that it was ok as his wife was accepting of those
things and supportive of him.
It wasn't that it was one affair, it was the, I guess, open marraige aspect.
And that I had known the guy for 6 years, thought we shared values, and I was
having dinner with him, and concerned he had interpretations that were
absolutely inaccurate. I know if I was receptive or showed interest, he would
have taken me up on it, but he didn't make a pass at me per se as in Karma's
situation. Maybe I was also insulted that he would have thought me interested
in him. Yes, I suppose that plays a role. As does it now strike me that maybe
others known of either his affair or his open lifestyle and have concluded I'm
involved in that from the professional relationship I have with him.
Not looking for advice, really. Just sharing along the lines of Karma of having
a pre-existing relationship and then a curve ball being thrown in.

Well not to be a jerk, but to assume that anyone in an open relationship is
interesting in having a relationship with you just because they spend time with
you, is rather assinine. Perhaps he would have taken you up on it, but don't
assume he would have just because you are a female and there. Even people in
open relationships have friends of the opposite gender. The fact that you were
so uncomfortable about it says more about you, than him. I understand being

Hey.  For reasons I'd rather not discuss, I'm 90% of the way toward deciding
that there's a divorce in my reasonably near future.  Our relationship is not
horrible -- we're pretty good friends -- but there are significant, perhaps
intractable issues regarding stuff like money, sex, and other priorities. 
We've done the counseling thing, and it honestly did work... kind of.  That
which got fixed served to highlight that which is still broken.

Anyway.  My biggest concern right now is our seven-year-old daughter.  I think
that the divorce will likely be as amicable as it can be, and I further think
we both agree that we're both important parts of her life.  Suggestions on
reading about how shared custody is best accomplished would be great; comments
on how shared custody has worked for you would also be welcome.  (Not terribly

I have some other situations going on in my life right now (mostly

Friendships just are weird that way. It's hard to know what the right thing is.
I had a huge fight with a friend (someone I know in person) while we were
chatting on FB, and we are no longer friends because of it. The funny thing,
she wouldn't talk to me on the phone about it, and though the story is too long
to share here, it was very much a "wow, this is not nearly the friendship I
thought we had." Sucks.

Splitting> I have not gone through the divorce/shared custody myself as a
parent, but I went through it as a kid of divorcing parents. It worked out
fine, it took a while (there were hard feelings during the divorce, as it was
brought on by my dad's affair) but they are friends now and get along well
enough. They worked with a mediator to make sure everything was fair to remove
their own selfishness from the procedure (as far as custody and support goes)
nothing was ever court ordered, including the support aspect. We didn't have
specific days/weekends we HAD to be with either parent, unless one of them was
going to be gone of course. Because we were free to see either of them when we
wanted, that was much easier, and as a result we had good relationships with
them both and spent ample time with them. i do know that if my dad had us (we
lived with my mom) for more than a week, my dad paid less child support. My mom
has said several times she wished she hadn't done that, because the amount my
dad paid for 2 kids was really low, and not getting that money when we took
vacations with my dad, hurt her ability to pay bills. But at the time she was
working an $8 an hour job, and my dad was making like $80k a year and only
paying $550 in child support a month. That was also 20 years ago, lol. It's
great to be amicable and understand each other, but I'd still recommend using
someone to help iron out the details who can be objective about the situation.

On a related note, my hubby's best friend gets custody of his kids a year a
time. How sucky is that, for both parents. I mean they do go see the other
parent over longer school breaks, but otherwise, they have to move every year
between Minnesota and WA. I can't imagine going through that as a kid, or a
parent.

Splitting> I can share some insight as a counselor who sometimes works with
young kids whose parents are divorcing. A book I've used with kids is, "I Don't
Want to Talk About It" by Jeanie Franz Ransom. It tells the story of a girl who
doesn't want to talk about the divorce but instead wants to turn into different
animals to avoid the conversations. It moves into what life will be like after
divorce adnd what will change and what will be the same. It ends letting her
know both parent love her very much. Kids have responded well to it.

One thing I always watch for is a kid feeling the need to take care of one or
both of their parents. For example, I had a six year old whose parents were
divorcing. She started to feel the need to take care of her mom because of how
her dad was acting. It is important in those situations to assure children that
you appreciate their concern, but you (or your partner) can take care of
yourselves. Reassure them your still the parent and your job is to take care of
them.

If things are going to be amicable, you'll avoid most of the problems like
trash talking the other parent. Another piece of advice I have is be open to
talking about the divorce and let your daughter know that. Like death,
sometimes get the feeling they aren't supposed to bring it up. They may worry
if they bring it up, it will upset the parents. I would plan ahead of time with
your spouse what information you will share with her and what you will not.
That will help prevent any confusion when she asks questions.

Not exactly what you asked for, but I wanted to share some of the things I've
seen as a counselor.

what sort of general bent the local court system takes on divorce cases.
Unless you actually want the default "One night a week between 5-8pm and every
other weekend" you may need to take steps to protect rights.  It just doesn't
matter what kind of a relationship you have currently, as soon as you start
talking about a divorce, I garuntee that every person that she talks to about
it will start giving her advice ranging from "Fuck him, take everything and
make him pay" to the more reasonable, but still dangerous "kids do better
with their mothers, it's just the way it is."

My divorce was very amicable, and the custody arrangements are too, but one of
the reasons that is so, is that I took the advice of a lawyer early on, didn't
move out of the house, actually increased my involvement with the school
classroom (parent assistant and such), paid without being asked for any
clothing or shoes, or supplies my son needed and arranged a "temporary" custody
agreement that I found acceptable between her moving out and the actual court
actions.  That way, by the time the court hearing actually took place, the
court was content to essentially order that everything "Stays as it is, since
it appears to work"

Other than that, don't get too caught up with feeling like you need to support
her, emotionally or otherwise.  You can really wear yourself out and end up
feeling stupid when you try and remain "the supportive partner" when the
relationship is ending/has ended.  Particularly if she has a historic tendency

two months post-break-up and you're already complaining about how long online
dating takes, you are going waaaaaay too fast. Slow. Down. Figure out YOU
before you dive back into the dating pool. Being with someone isn't going to
make you happy long-term; being happy with yourself WILL. And you won't be able
to make the right decisions for yourself if you're diving back into dating.

Give yourself time. Give yourself energy. Give yourself your attention. Be okay

Reposted without my name in the header, though every user on here's probably

I am a couple months out of what I thought was a committed, 2+yr, live-in
relationship where I found out my girl had been up to serious emotional and
sexual infidelity.  AFAIK, nothing but time heals this sort of thing, and
nothing but a new relationship really helps to get over it; but in the meantime
would be nice to be distracted.  Trying online dating but it seems to be really
slow going.

In the meantime, contacted an ex I hadn't seen in six years.  Talked couple of
days, spent time with her and slept with her 3rd day.  She wants to do fwb,
says she is not able to do a relationship at this point.  I *know* I'm not
ready to do a relationship either.  Problem is I still have strong feelings for
her, and am not usually comfortable with unattached sex.

Any hope here?  I plan to see if the feelings for her disipate as the newness
of this wears off.

If you have strong feelings for her then it might be best to stay out of that
situation of FWB.  What was the reason for your break up to begin with?  You
might just be doing a rebound with her and not know it.  It is hard to say.  I
personally never have rebounded with an ex, but if I did I'm sure one of us
would end up getting hurt again in the long run.  Does this ex live near you?
That could make a difference as well. If you do not see her often then the
attachment might not become as strong as time goes on.

Nothing wrong with being friends with the ex, but I'd try to move on to other
things in life and not really focus on her.  If she is around to help you
release some tension and have fun the all for it.

For what it's worth, I started a new relationship a few weeks after my last one
ended.  It was with someone I'd already known and had a soft spot for.  I know
why my previous relationship ended--it had to do with that person not really
wanting to be with me all along.  I figured that I shouldn't have to waste
weeks or months wondering why some person didn't want to be with me wihle I had
someone in front of me who already did.

That was more luck than anything else, but we're still goign strong.  I don't
know if I'd say I made some of the same mistakes as before, but I nkow I'm a
lot better off.  I guess at the end of the day, I didn't feel like giving up on
something just because the calendar didn't look right.

Rebound here.  I don't think dating anyone will solve anything, no, far from
it.  I think it'll provide distraction and make it a little easier to deal with
day-to-day life for a bit - that is all.

Broke up with this ex a long time ago because she had some issues that are now
addressed.  She lives close enough that we'll probably get to see each other
for an evening or weekend day most weeks, and that's about it.

Today the counselor I've been seeing for a couple months said this is a great
opportunity to practice setting boundaries and sticking to them, and that the
timing's good.  She said do friends or fwb, but keep it there; said there are
roles for every personal relationship in my life, and that those roles need
defined and boundaries set.  So we'll see, as long as I don't focus on her too
much (I *am* working on other things I'd like to change in my life).

I really didn't expect counselor to think it was such a good idea... I *did*
fail to mention on here that this ex has very upfront about everything, which
is why I think she's relatively healthy and safe to try this with.  So at this
point, I'm going to see where it leads.

My company is having an off site Christmas party. The party will be dinner at a
restaurant, going out to a dance/night club, and then people having the option
to stay at a hotel in their own room afterwards. Company would pay for all of
this.

Spouses/SOs are invited but have to pay their own way at the restaurant/dance
club.  They can stay in the hotel room with the employee at no extra charge.

There has not been any insinuation that those who go to the event without a
spouse/SO are expected to "hook up" or anything like that. The hotel is because
the event is over an hour away and people may not want to or be able to drive
home after a night out.

Anyway, point is my wife can't go because of work and doesn't want me to go
"because it sounds weird." I feel like I should be able to enjoy a night out
with friends/coworkers and stay in a fancy hotel for free if I want to (I very
rarely go out and do anything "fun", let alone without my wife/family with me).

Is she being completely unreasonable or should I just go and eat at the
restaurant and then come home?

The fact that your company is providing hotel rooms isn't really odd or weird.
And I don't think your wife would find it odd or weird either, if she were able

party, solo, and then stay in a hotel with all of his co-workers, solo.  It's
unusual, I'll grant that, but I think if you don't have a history of being
untrustworthy, then what the hell, right?  Better that than the alternative of
you drinking and driving.
I would phrase it like that - you'd rather stay in the hotel than drink and
drive. And since this is a holiday celebration, you will be drinking, and you
don't want to take any chances.  Also, be nice to your wife, since she probably
feels a little left out that she can't join you.  Maybe take her out to dinner

A company woman here> My company does many offsites and stay away type of
events. Some of these I find odd and even crossing some lines of familiarity in
the way they are done, and some are compeletely business focused and a hotel
stay is just for logistics.
If you and your wife are not planning to drink much such that you would be
sober enough to drive, why not go to the dinner portion then drive home? If
there's no conversations or discussions planned for the next day, then there's
no real reason to stay. And all kinds of excuses can be brought to the need to
leave early. If your wife cannot attend the entire thing, what about her
driving and joining for dinner, or for dessert, and then both of you heading
out? Many times these corporate dinner event + spouse are as much about helping
the spouse meet coworkers and building rapport and relationship among the
employees. It's sometimes recognition sometimes to thank for the time away from
the spouse at other times, etc.
I do a lot of dinners, and a lot of travel and stay away sort of things.
There's many events that my husband is invited to, and has no interest in
doing. And he's not an extrovert and not comfortable in those kinds of casual
social environemnts where he doesn't have a relationship with others. But he
has no problem with me going to dinner or doing the trips when it fits in with
my career relationships. I have been hit on at some of these, but it isn't that
frequent given how often and over how much time I have participated. He also
trusts me completely and I am careful not to be in compromising situaitons,
either perceived by others or real.
Your priority is your wife, I would assume. Her comfort and needs are prime. SO
beg off the dinner that you have other commitments that you cannot break. That
seems the clear answer to the situation you present. But your wife won't get
comfortable with such things unless she sees what the dinner actually is and is
not. And it sounds like a good opportunity to participate in a company event
with people you need to build relationshis with, and would like your wife to
know some of the players you work with - if only so that when you bitch about
them she can put a face with a name :) So perhaps there is a third way here
where she can join for a tleast part and you don't stay overnight.

It's not the first time something like this has happened and it never ends
well.  I've had company events/a night out with coworkers probably less than
ten times in 14 years and every time that she has not been able to come/didn't
want to come/was not invited due to business reasons she has been IMO very
difficult and unreasonable about it.

Her position is that if it's a party or get together spouses should be invited.
And if spouses are not invited then there's no reason why I should want to
spend an evening away from my family. Seriously, she has told me this.  And I'm
serious when I say it's maybe ten times in more than ten years that this has
happened so it's not like it's a "weekly night out with the guys" type thing.

This is the first time where a possible overnight stay is involved so I KIND OF
get where she's coming from, but I can tell you that if her work had a similar
function and I wasn't able to go I'd have no problem with her attending/staying
the night.  And to be fair, she would probably not want to do such a thing

How does that NOT lead to him getting taken advantage of, all the time?

Let me eludicate.

I think he's right.  But unless my estranged husband has miraculously landed a
fantastic job and joined the bbs, I'm not his wife.  His wife is unhappy.  The
tenet my dad claims is the secret to his long marriage to my mother (37 years
now) is "Happy wife = happy life."

I think the root issue here isn't "office party," it's "couple stuff."  A lot
of women, for a variety of reasons, seem to take issue with guys doing guy
stuff rather than doing couple stuff.  (Don't ask me, I don't get it.)  The
fact that this is work-related for Company Man is almost irrelevant.  It's
"her" guy, wanting to go do guy stuff, from which she feels excluded.  Maybe
there's also a level of "I have to be mom and wife and work and _I_ never get a
night away, so why should HE??" going on here.  I don't know.

Me, I'd be having a conversation about trust, boundaries, and the healthiness
of separate time and space.  But as noted above, my husband and I are separated
(for over 6 years now), and I also have an ex-husband.  So maybe I'm not the
best to be giving relationship advice.

So, Company Man, is this the hill you want to die on?  Do you want to fight for
your right to party?  (Sorry, couldn't resist.)  Do you want to be right?  Or
do you want to compromise?  Do you want to stay with this woman for the long
haul and have mostly good memories?  Do you want to be happy?

So, if there is no one to watch the kids, how is she working on Sunday when you
won't be home yet?
Anyhow, I can tell you how she might be feeling. Left out. Having small kids,
as you know, is no easy chore, and its hard on a relationship when you don't
get time alone. So what she is seeing is that she is stuck home while you get
to go have fun without her, and she's probably feeling a bit left out, and sad
that you coworkers get to spend time with you that she doesn't. My husband has
to go to offsite meetings for his job. I trust him 100%. I don't worry about
what he's doing, and I would never, ever tell him I didn't want him to go. But
I do feel a bit sad, and jealous that I don't get those kind of trips with my
husband because our current life makes it really difficult (we have a diabetic
young child and leaving him overnight with other people is pretty much out of
the question right now). So, I just suck it up. I make plans for me and the
kids while he is gone. I eat what I wanna eat, I watch what I wanna watch, I
hog the bed and turn the thermostat up to 70, and I do all the things that I
compromise on and enjoy myself, lol. He works hard, he is our only wage earner,
and even if I wish I could have weekends alone with him at a nice hotel, I
can't, but that doesn't mean he doesn't deserve to go.

So, perhaps you could do something for her to make her feel special before or
after you go. But you do all the work. Find a sitter for whatever time you can,
and go have a good time with your wife. It's no fun to feel like you are left
behind when your spouse gets to go to a fun night on the town, for free, and
you get left with dirty dishes, screaming children and no husband to cuddle
with at night.

COmpany woman here> Another "third way" might be to find other couples who have
kids and go in together to get a babysitter or two for the event. Kids and
babysitter have a pizza and swimming evening or movies in one of the suites and
it becomes a family thing for some participants, a husband-wife getaway for
others.
I understand the wife needs to work Sunday morning, although perhaps there's
some room for getting out of that, or not staying the night and getting back
home. Making the event even more inclusive for others who are likely also in
teh same boat might build relationships at work among those COmpany Man works
with. And the wife is taken care of, the kids are included, and everybody wins
:)
Yet I think CM said she wasn't interested in going anyways. Maybe there's a
perspective that overcomes this, I don't know. For my introvert husband it
could still be a hard sell, but if I really asked him to go and reassured him
he wouldn't need to make awkward conversation he'd go.
Perhaps the wife is feling unattractive - small kids, recent pregnancy, still
holding on to pregnancy weight? She may not want to be seen at her peak. Or
many she doesn't have something attractive to wear. Or feels like she's
"beneath" the wives of other company men - not as good or accomplished.
It could be two separate driving issues - one being a fear or insecurity and so
she doesn't want to go, and then she may be feeling unappreciated or
undervalued and so she wants him to stay to give her attention.
Either way a conversation is needed, and yet she might not feel secure enough
to share the real root. I like what Artemis and Mama are saying. CM has to
decide if this is a permanent restriction he can live with (seems likely), and
yet if there's something deeper that manifests itself in this issue.

Honestly?  I think there's a legit compromise here.  You go to the holiday
party, but don't spend the night in a hotel.  Also, you and your wife talk
about giving her the opportunity to do fun stuff on her own/with her friends,
so that she doesn't feel so left out during the few times a year you want to do

This is going to require you stepping up to the plate to stay home and take

First, she does it a "few times" not several. Second, she doesn't stay
overnight. If he wants to go for the evening and leave her with the kids, then
no problem. If the overnight thing is the only sticking thing, then why not

I still do not understandy why she can't try and get time off of work so you
both can go together and stay at the hotel.  It is like a mini vacation that
you don't have to pay for.  I can understand how Company Man feels.  If he
never gets to do any of these things for so long and she gets to a few times a
year?  She is beyond selfish and needs to compromise.  I see where Company Man
is coming from that it is a nice hotel and why not enjoy it.  Why not enjoy it
with your wife?  Yes I know she has to work but if you know far enough in
advance then she should at least try and get time off of work.  I know I'd do
that if I was in that position. Marriage is about making each other happy and
she is not doing anything to make you happy in this regard.  If my spouse pull

Company Man> The holiday party was scheduled the day before I originally posted

Frankly, I think the "compromise" is the most appropriate thing to do, although
if she were in my shoes I certainly wouldn't mind if she took advantage of the
opportunity to not have to make an hour+ drive back home late at night and
could stay in a fancy hotel for free.

She is not able to get the time off work; it's the nature of her job.

And we have dealt with this issue before; everytime I have the opportunity to
go out and she can't/won't go. Usually I go and she's mad for 24-48 hours
afterwards and then everything is back to normal. When she's over it, she'll
admit she's a little unreasonable but she always goes back to how she just
can't believe that I'd rather be doing something that's not with my family and
how is she supposed to ecplain to the kids that daddy doesn't want to be at
home tonight and garbage like that.

But you said you would be back in time Sunday to watch the kids while she
works, so, why can't you both go and still be back Sunday in time for her to
work? Yes, it requires getting a babysitter for the night, but there must be
someone you can call. Surely you are not the ONLY married couple with children
at your work place, you can't talk to those you work with and see what they are
doing with their kids? There are even daycares that do overnight care. It's
worth looking into.

I can relate to how she feels, because I've been there. I've never talked to my
kids that way, but I've been mad, in the past and then felt fine afterwards.
The key was eventually I grew up and realized that my feelings were my problem,
and not his, and my feelinsg were the result of things that happened in my
past, and nothing he ever did, so even if I don't like something, I know my
feelings are mine to deal with and that they will pass. So, I give my blessing,
he enjoys his time, and I know how I feel will be better soon. Hopefully your
wife will grow up and figure that out, too.

Another way to think of it though is that she likes spending time with you
enough that she misses you when you are gone. It just seems to me like there is
far more going on than simply she not wanting you to go and not being able to
go with. More that needs relationship work to work out between you, and not
simply an issue/event to figure out.

On a different topic, call it Estranged Sister>

So, I have one full-blood sister and two half-sisters.  My sister J I am on
normal family terms with.  We go to family events, the kids play together, we
visit each other, etc.  Normal stuff.

My two half-sisters, A & K, moved away to Texas with their mom - my ex-step-mom
 - when she divorced my dad.  J kept in contact with them throughout the years.
I didn't.  I had a bit of resentment towards their mom for bankrupting my dad
with the divorce.  Also, the fact that they never (as far as I know) expressed
an interest to continue to have contact with my dad after the move.  They
didn't even come up when he passed.  As far as I know, only K has ever made the
trip up to visit his gravesite.

I've seen them time to time when they've visited my sister and at her wedding.
The wedding was the first time I had seen them in pretty much 10 years.  It was
very awkward.  I didn't know what to say to them and vice versa.  At the very
end, K & I exchanged a big hug...almost of...relief?  I'm not sure.

I'm not opposed to re-establishing contact with them.  I chat sometimes online
with K, but not often.  When I got married a couple of months back, K sent me a
congratulatory email - she had seen it noted on J's Facebook page.  I finally
replied this past weekend and since she had expressed an interest in catching
up, included my yahoo and gmail names.  She added me yesterday and we've
chatted a bit so far.

Last night, she told me she was coming up at the end of the month to visit my
sister here in my town so they could go to my dad's favorite restaurant and
visit his grave.  She offered that I could come too.

Here is where my feelings are conflicted.  I look at how they visit my sister
and how my niece and nephew have their aunts in their lives.  I can only
imagine they are the better for it.  My daughter only has my sister and my
brother, not them.  They've never met my daughter (8 yrs old) nor my wife (been
with her 4 yrs).  I had sent an email early this year asking if they were
interested in establishing some kind of contact and never got a reply.  J told
me that they had been talking about it, but since they never replied, I assumed
they didn't.

I can continue to be relatively estranged from them, or I can try to re-
establish those relationships tentatively and let my daughter have access to
their aunts.  Has anyone else had something like this?  How did it go?  Was it
too awkward?  I'm just at a loss as to how to proceed.  Part of me says to jump
at this chance.  Part of me says, why bother.

In case it matters, A hasn't really contacted me other than asking for some of
my dad's and grandfather's records that I had.  K seems to be the one making
any efforts.

Thanks for any considerations and input you may have to offer.

mention of it. Have you discussed/planned with your wife what would happen if
you went the party and stayed the night, but called her after the party and
before you headed to bed, to let her know you do miss her, that she didn't miss
much (haha) and to reassure her that it's not going to be a wild night where
coworkers party too hard and make some dumb mistakes? That last part is what
came to my mind when you originally said she thought it was "weird" that the
hotel rooms were involved, and maybe she had some insecurity about the slight
chance of things getting out of control. Lord knows I'm not the best to give

I just got the Christmas letter that my mom sends out every year.  And it's
long-winded and boring with a crappy photo of my sister and the typical
mis-information about what my sister and I are doing, because she never bothers
to pay attention to these things.  Whatever, that's par for the course.  Then I
got to the 2nd to last paragraph where she is FINALLY accurate about
something.....only it's to tell everyone in their holiday mailing list the
gender of my 15 week old fetus, which some VERY preliminary tests have shown. 
Needless to say, my husband and I are livid for many reasons.
-
First, when I told them about the test results 2 weeks ago, I also told them
that this was TENTATIVE and not CONFIRMED until the 20 week ultrasound.  And I
told my parents that my husband and I wanted to be the ones to tell people.  My
mom has a terrible memory, so I'd like to think that this was just an honest
error, but seriously?!?  Who in their right mind thinks it's a good idea to
vomit up the gender of their potential grandchild in a damn holiday letter??? 
Especially since the parents of said grandchild have yet to say a word about it
to anyone.
-
Second, this puts my husband and I in a HUGE pickle, because he did not tell
his folks yet about the test results.  So now they've been set up to learn the
gender of their grandchild through my mom's dumb holiday letter.  And we are
swamped with work today, so I'm not sure if my husband will have time to call
his folks to potentially head off the letter.  ::groans::  This is a nightmare.
-
So I've already called my mom to ask if she sent the letter to my in-laws (she
did) and to reiterate that it wasn't kosher to spread the news like this (she
apologized).  I know that ultimately, this is my fault.  I'm really beating
myself up over this.  I don't know when I will ever learn that I can't trust my
mom with anything confidential.
-
I need some help addressing this with her when I've calmed down.  I've always
hated her stupid holiday cards, but I know she likes doing them.  In previous
years, she's let my sister and I proof them before she sends them out, but she
didn't do that this year.  Should I tell her to let us do that?  Should I ask
her to apologize to my in-laws for spilling the beans?  Should I ask her to
stop sending out those holiday letters?  Maybe send a nice card with a family
photo instead?  Halp.

Angry Daughter>  I suspect you are primarily venting, and if not, WORF is
pretty much on the nose as far as I'm concerned.  But to address the unasked
question.  Don't let people give you shit about how you did or did not choose
to tell people anything regarding your upcoming child.  Outside of telling a
spouse pretty damn quick (or the father), no one else has the right to an
opinion.  Obviously, lots of rude and unthinking people like to think they do,
and you can't usually stop them,  but try not to let it stress you out.  His
parents get upset?  They'll get over it.  If they are unkind, your husband can
let them know it's unacceptable.  By all means he can explain the situation,
but if they are unreasonable people, then they are unreasonable people.  By the
time the kid pops out, all should be forgotten unless you really drew the short
end of the stick on in-laws.

And lastly, take advantage of your situation.  You are pregnant, with hormones
raging.  It's one of the only chances you will have to cause an unbelievable
scene if someone fusses at you, and they can't hold it against you when you
apologize the next day because of the hormones.  And I'm willing to bet that
one raging outburst would be enough to get people to walk gingerly around you
throughout the end of the pregnancy.

I know this seems tongue in cheek, and to some extent, maybe it is.  But it's
also true.  My motto has always been (since I experienced one) "Always be wary
of pregnant women."  This is followed closely by my advice to husbands of "Keep

never hesitate before offering to go get one."

Is there an option where you go alone to represent your family, but the kids
get to stay home and stay in school? Especially if you could travel faster
without the kids and maybe be gone for less time? In my family, it is not
uncommon for those of us with younger kids to only send one person to this sort
of event so that the kids don't have to come. If that isn't an option, I'd
probably resort to sending flowers. Depending on their age, funerals can be
very difficult for kids at the best of times. Add in a significant amount of
travel, and things are even worse. Sometimes it's better for the rest of the
family to not also have to deal with cranky kids on top of everything else. At

6 hours away which means 12 hours travel time.  That is a long time for someone
you met once.  I understand this is your step-mom's father but I'm sure she
would understand that you can't pull the kids out of school.  A funeral is no
place for kids if they do not know the decease.  As someone previous stated.
it is typical to send one person to pay respects for the entire family.
Sometimes life happens.  We had some deaths in the family and not everyone was
able to go.  For example my SIL's brother and my other SIL grandparents.  All
of these were in town yet not everyone in our family was able to attend the
funeral.
Send flowers and/or a donation.  I would also do something special for your
step-mom to let her know how much you care.  You being there for the long haul
will mean more in the long run.  Have food ready for them when they get back
from the funeral.  She will ge exhausted and when you are grieving sometimes
you have to force yourself to eat and take care of yourself.

I don't disagree with not going to the funeral, for all the circumstances
listed. Just keep in mind that going to the funeral has little to do with
remembering the person who died (unless you are very close family) and more to
do with providing support to those close people who were left behind.

My mom married my stepdad when I was already 30 something. We see my stepdad's
mom several times a year and she only lives an hour away and when she dies one
day, I imagine we'll go to the funeral but it will be entirely to support my
stepdad and my mom, not because of how well I know, or like my stepdads mom.
But circumstances are different because she lives so close, of course. Funerals
are difficult for kids, but I don't think that keeping them from funerals is a
good way to help them deal with death. There are different ways t explain death
to kids of different ages, so using them as a reason to miss a funeral, I don't
think, is always the right thing to do.

Anyhow, for the poster, I agree with sending flowers. The circumstances just
are beyond what is necessary or prudent. My other comments are directed
generally to other comments i saw, and not to the situation the poster is in.

I was talking in reference of not having the kids go because there is no reason
for them there since they probably didn't know the person anyway.  There is a
time and place for kids during funeral times.  This is not one of them.
When my grandma died I had family that were upset because the great grand kids
were running around the funeral home.  They clearly do not understand that the
kids were trying to process that Great Grandma was gone.  They would go up to
her look at her and then get sad then run away and play.  Sure they should not
have been running around the funeral home but having them there was a way to
help them process. I am in my 30's and I didn't attend a funeral until a parent
oh wait, until my Great Aunt passed away. I went to a visitation but that was
it. Growing up I am grateful that I didn't have to deal with a death.  If I had
I would have liked to know the process.

The support for the family I do understand as I have been on the receiving and
giving support in that situation.  I had a SIL that didn't come to my parent
funeral because she was pregnant but I don't think that is why she didn't come.
She didn't come because it was too hard on her since she lost her mom.  My
other SIL didn't come either, and I'm sure her excuse might have been that she
had to watch the kids, which she had her parents who could have watched. I
don't get hung up on that stuff.  If anything they should be understanding.

The support is there before the funeral and after when they get home. I'm sure
that would be greatly appreciated to have a warm meal when coming home from the
funeral.  All too often people forget the griever after the funeral.

But then if kids are sheltered from it, when a big death comes they are ill
equipped. If no one dies, then that's how it is. I'm not saying you are
agreeing with sheltering them or anything, just discussting in general. Other
than a couple pets, my kids first experience with death was the unexpected
death of their father. It sure would have been easier to deal with such a big
one if there had been minor ones prior. When I was 5, my grandfather died. Over
time, various relatives and others known to us died as well. The one that had
the most impact on my young life was the death of my favorite cat, who was
attacked by my uncles dog. So, you just never know what impacts a kid.

Anyhow, I think it's ok for kids to know that sometimes we do things to make
others feel better, adn to provide support to them in difficult times. My kids
learned about it when many peopel came to support them after their dad died.
They remember that and want to provide hugs and nice words to others who go
through it. Kids really understand more than we think they do, they just need
proper guidance from us.

Yes but there is no need to drag them out of school to drive 12 hours round

suggesting that parents should just take kids to random funerals that they
don't know?  I was lucky enough that I didn't have to attend a funeral until
later in life.  If a person is going to lose a parent suddenly it won't matter
if they have been to several funerals or not.  I have a sibling that attended
several funerals and had just as hard of a time as I did when our parent died.
I'm sorry your kids father died, it is tragic and I'm sorry but going to
funerals before he died wouldn't have made the tragedy any easier.

My SIL mother passed away a few months ago and the kids were bored out of their
mind.  When it wasn't time for the rosary at the visitation or the actual
funeral they were found in the other room playing games and keeping to
themselves.  Sure they were really sad their grandmother died but they are
kids.  I couldn't imagine pulling kids out of school for a 12 hour round trip

First, like I said, I am speakin gernally and not about the poster's situation.
Second, I'm not saying more funerals makes death easier. It makes the process
of understanding what is happening and what to expect, easier. Should kids go
to funerals of people they didn't know? Depending on who that person is, and
the kids age, sometimes, yes they should. Because like I said going to funerals
is about providing support to those left behind, not doing something for the
person who is dead and doesn't know, or care, that people are there weeping
over their casket. We traveled 5.5 hours one way to go to my great grandmothers
funeral. My children had never met her. But it was about providing support to
my dad and his siblings who were very close to her. Kids deal with things just
fine when they have an idea what to expect. Learning that sometimes you do
things for other people whether you want to do them or not is an important
lesson.

case, he probably needed to hear it and maybe he'll realize he is probably
making the woman feel like she is just filling a space in his life for sex
until he finds a better man to be with instead.

My thesis is that sports is a social construction, that women and men differ

that for women to participate in the cultural phenomenon of sports that
construction must be recognized and addressed.  Which may, in practice, mean
different rules for women's teams than for men's teams, and in extremis
(although this hasn't happened) a reconception of sports as an activity for
women.  I would *LOVE*, just fucking *LOVE* to address what that would look

Why does everything have to have a point?

Because there are others in the conversation, and some of them are hung up on
"meaning" as a perceived need, supplying information for consideration, cues
for response, and facts or conclusions for evaluation.

When you make a statement in a room full of people talking about a subject -
let's say "gender issues", for the sake of example - you run the risk of other
participants assuming your statemenet had intention, meaning, and context from
your perspective.  Together those elements are often summarized colloquially as
your "point", and folks might ask you to overtly summarize if your intention is
less than clear.

Now, if you didn't have intention, meaning, or context to contribute, that's
all well and good, but you can underrstand why we might be confused that you
spoke, if that's the case.

It'd also be interesting to see what kind of sports require, rather than

Actually, now that I think of it, I've described some sports that are,

Good point, Bodhi!  You're right that football, basketball, hocky, and
wrestling all privilege strength over endurance and flexibility.  It's also
interesting, though, to note that teamwork isn't the same thing as competition.
Competition is a social construction that is, in some sense, partially
diametrically opposed to teamwork.  Teamwork is cooperation, while competition
is -- um, competition.  In most masculinely coded sports, such as football,
baseball, and basketball, the team works together in the aim of competition. 
In wrestling, of course, you have single competition, and the team works
together only insofar as each member's contribution helps or harms the whole. 
But that's a good point, I'm glad you brought up wrestling.

A purely cooperative sport would be interesting to behold.  I can think of few
examples, except perhaps dance and similar activities, in whcih any competition
must be imported externally -- by, for example, having judges give scores.

Sure, maybe in some places - such as the defensive line.  But a quarterback or
receiver have to be very agile on their feet and a receiver has to be able to
keep giving it 100% even after taking pounding after pounding.
With the exception of wrestling, all of these are team sports.  Teamwork is
fundamental.  Sport dance is highly competitive, by the way.  And there is no
real difference between a judge giving scores and getting scores by crossing
some line or putting some ball in a hoop other than that one is based on
subjective judgement and the other is (relatively) objective.

Yeah, you're right, Bodhi.  There is a difference between scoring by one's own
direct action (hoops, goals) and scoring by means of a panel of independent
judges.  The latter strike me as an attempt to graft competition onto the
nature of the point.

You also bring up a good point that specific members of a football team must be
more flexible than strong, but of course those are the minority of the players
while the majority must be stronger and more massive.  Of course, any physical
activity will require *some* organization of strength, flexibility, and
endurance.  But some sports emphasize some over others.

It occurs to me that there are mental elements, as well.  Men are, at least in
our culture, somewhat better at spatial orientation on average, so it makes
sense that many traditionally masculien sports involve aiming for a hoop or
goal.  Women, on the other hand, in our culture, tend to be better at nonverbal
communication and coordination, which fits again my idea of dance as the
prototype of feminine sports.

Sure, you're right.  Most football players aren't on the defensive line.  Yes,

Well, I'd normally define Hermaphroditic as the biological term and Androgynous
as the cultural/social term.  Both mean "having both characteristics" but you
can be one without being the other.

My particular feeling is that a sport (or sporting organization, such as the
IOC) needs to codify what their specific definition of a group is, if they
choose to distinguish records within that group.  If they define female as
having XX chromosones, that's OK, if they define it as having no testes, OK.
If no such distinction exists now that would disqualify Semenya, her records
should stand, and if they later prohibit her, she'll probably get the
much-maligned "asterisk" but it is more fair than stipping her of the
titles/records, IMHO.

No posts in here for over a year? HOLY CRAP.

Well, I'm reading some equal protection law on gender discrimination, and ran
across some tidbits worth at least mentioning.

1) When the ERA was proposed, the 14th Amendment was not interpreted so as to
protect gender discrimination  beyond having some sort of conceivable rational
basis to do so. Given that fact, that people voted against the ERA just
flabbergasts me. Thankfully, the Court seems to have taken the equal protection
clause at face value instead to do much the same thing, since people are
apparently twits.

2) REading the case about integration of the Virginia Military Institute. The
courts originally found that it was unfairly discriminatory because there was
no similar military-style option for women to use, and told the government to
fix it. The state decided to make a similar program at a private school, and
had a Task Force design it. The Task Force thought that a military model would
be "wholly inappropriate," and decided that there needed to be a "cooperative
method which reinforced self-esteem."

In other words, the state was told to come up with a military-style option for
women, and ended up with a "cooperative method," because they're WOMEN after
all, so they didn't REALLY want a military option. And they thought this was a
reasonable alternative.

I was wondering if you'd call me on that, though. On reflection, it's not
_necessarily_ paternalism if it's male, though, at least not to the same

everyone in a certain class _really_ wants the same thing. But there are
potentially sexism issues if it's a male as well.

Why are separate bathrooms for women and men considered OK but separate
bathrooms for straight women and lesbians as well as straight men and gay men

Does the logic that allows for one, not allow for the other?

And if one is discriminatory, shouldn't both be?


There is actually a debate about this going on right now in a South American
country (I want to say Brazil or Venezuela, but can't remember offhand, would
have to google the article) because of an upcoming major event where segregated
bathrooms were setup at a stadium.

In all honesty, my first thought wasn't paternalism at all, but the complete

Hee hee hee. I'd say that there are two competing reasons for segregation:
1) Sex-based differences based on the desire to keep people separate when they
are unclothed, in order to avoid sexual arousal and its attendant dangers;

2) Keeping people out of one's bathroom because one doesn't like, or fears, the
other person.

The first is at least moderately reasonable, the second is bad.

The problem is that when people propose the idea, it's tough to tell what their
logic is... which reason they're using.

If you believe the first, then you should, by extension want to see completely
separate facilities for all four gender identities.

The same is oddly true of the second argument, which can make for some odd
bedfellows.

The simplest solution is just to have "generic bathrooms" which can be used by
all, but you rarely see many openly argue for that. Even those who push for
full equality still typically have a level of ingrained sexism when it comes to
the bathroom.

The question wasn't posed to trap anyone, but mostly because I think it could
be an interesting starting point for a discussion. We could even look to the US
Military for examples.

After all, with Don't Ask, Don't Tell officially repealed, the military would
be a prime candidate for simply having unified bathroom and shower facilities.
After all, all soldiers are created equal, right?

The pros behind this would be a much simplified deployment structure and
flexibility in housing.

So, I'm a Freemason, which is a fraternity and hence a Men's only club.  A good
friend of mine considers himself to be a feminist, and views any single gender
organization as descriminatory.

Personally, I think this is kind of a sad way to view the world.  I take part
in all kinds of mixed gender activities and groups/clubs, but sometimes having
an all men or all women group has benefits as well.  I know lots of ladies who
get a LOT out of girls night out with their friends, or who work out at ladies
only gums.

What do peole here think? Is there a place in the world for organizations that
are single gender by nature?

Certainly.. how about the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts?  Those are pretty
commonly accepted organizations.  There are a lot of others out there, too.

I'm not exactly sure what Masons do that women would want to do.. I thought
they mostly just studied artifacts, drank beer and maybe had an occasional
swordfight, but that's just a wild guess.  :)  Ask your friend if he knows any
women who have been excluded from the organization.  If not, sounds like he's
just making juggies out of raisins.

I think there's a difference between organizations that simply discriminate out
of tradition (not to mention sexism) and those who discriminate because there
exists a difference in the cultural discourse of genders and there is something
valuable to accepting all of those.

The first is bad, at least to my mind; the second is good. The problem is that
a whole bunch of people who discriminated for the first reason used the second
as an excuse, which explains a whole lot of suspicion on the part of people who
were discriminated against.

It was a big theme in '70s feminism especially, and it's still an undercurrent
in a lot of feminist thought. The idea is pretty simple, really: as long as you
insist that the genders are different, then one group (probably the men) would
end up with more power. The only way to ensure that the groups are to be
treated equally is to make sure there is no discrimination whatsoever.

The problem for feminists, of course, is that they can't talk about how special
women are and at the same time insist on gender-blind equality.  Thus (and
correctly in my view) the shift to seeing differences and allowing both genders
to express them in their own ways.

Just a quick reminder about companies like Curves:

That gym exists in order to address problems many women have had when
attempting to attend conventional gyms.  Writing as a woman who goes to a rec
center populated primarily by younger individuals and dominated by young men, I
can see the problem.

When women attend a gym populated by only other women - particularly older
women - they won't feel as out of place.  I feel intimidated at the prospect of
using the weight machines, where all the would-be male athletes hang out, and
some sections of the gym seem unavailable to me.  An all-female gym also lets
out much of the ogling factor - although younger women might find hook-ups
through gym memberships interesting, older women will not, and will prefer to
take aerobics and swimming classs away from the male gaze.  Curves also
advertises trainers with experience in helping older, out of shape women with
workouts that allow them to ramp up gradually without too much pain, and they
specialize in weight loss programs.  I have known several women who started up
at Curves after having babies to get rid of that baby tummy.  With experienced
trainers on staff to help with targeted workouts, they felt much more
comfortable than they would be if they just attended a local rec center.

I do not have a membership at such a gym - I typically don't find myself as
troubled by exercizing next to buff young men in their 20s - and I'm starting
to see more women in their 60s attending to use the bikes and treadmills, but
this is fairly new.  Eventually, I would hope the novelty of co-ed workouts
will end the need for separate facilities, whether we're talking about tacitly
all-male companies or those marketed specifically for women.

If there's any career advancement going on over treadmills at this rec center,
it would only be passed along through iPod headphones.  As far as I can tell,
this place is JUST about the sweat.  Which is as it should be.

Boy Scouts/Girl Scouts - I am the mother of a Boy Scout.  There are differences
between the two orgaizations, and they aren't good.  While my son goes to camp
every summer and learns to canoe, build a cabin, fish, shoot a .22 caliber
rifle, and cook over a camp fire, girls his age are relegated to light camping,
crafts, and cookery.  It's a crock.

My son sold over $5000 in Boy Scout popcorn last year.  In return, he got $900
in gift cards and $1500 for his own personal account with the scouts.  That
account will pay for equipment, camps, activities, badges, trips, etc.  Girl
Scouts sell cookies, and get on average $.40 per box.  All that money goes to
the council, not to the local troops.  None of it benefits the girls who sell
it directly, and their prizes are along the line of highlighter pens, pink
notebooks, pencil sets.

The disparity between the groups bothers me a lot.  Girls craft; boys learn
archery.  Gee - which one would be more fun?  Next year, Max can go to a camp
and learn to ride a horse.  11 year old Girl Scouts can go to a camp where they
stay in cabins and go on limited hikes.

I'm so glad I don't have a girl.

one goes through the trouble of deflating it of all the hot air.  But, it's
value is largely around the idea of it's emphasis on positioned subjects and
metanarratives.  And neither of those are new ideas that postmodernism brought
to the table.  Those ideas were floating around for decades in the social

Curves is not about shutting men out for the sake of power or money.  I have

I have, though, known several women who did attend Curves.  They tend to be

had anything in the way of economic favors to give.  Could it be a pick-up
place for lesbians?  Hell, yeah.  Hard to see how that's any better than the
leering men.

All I'm saying is, recognize that some women (not all) have difficulty with the
prospect of exercising next to sweating and, often, leering men.  Even if they
don't leer, many will still feel intimidated and alienated.  Whether or not
they should, they do feel as though the aren't welcome or aren't recognized as
legitimate users of the equipment.  Curves meets that need.  I don't know if
power and favors trade hands between women there, but I will say this...

In general, women still have less in the way of favors to trade.  Fewer female
CEOs, department chairs, medical chiefs, etc.  Less power to trade typically
means they're less likely to be passing favors back and forth.

That's all I'm saying.

Curves caters to non-physically fit women who have previously been inactive and
the simple circuit training regime followed there is a means to ease women into
working out at the gym.  As a former member of Curves a few years ago, I can
say it was for women who were wary of joining a real gym because they would
feel intimidated by men AND women who were more physically fit then they were
and felt out of place in higher level exercise classes and with more
complicated fitness equipment.  Curves allows women to earn Curves Cash on
their visits too which they can trade in for water bottles, towels, tote bags
etc. as extra motivation to workout.  It is not meant to be a lifetime gym for
women but an introduction to fitness in a non-pressure, non-intimidating
environment.  As a member becomes more comfortable with a physical fitness
routine, they will eventually outgrow Curves and be ready to move on to a
bigger gym with exercise classes and better fitness equipment.  They will feel
less intimidated by the others around them and self-conscious about how they
look and be able to just be focused on their workout and not those superficial
factors.

before schlepping from their own non-gay-marrying state to a place two

That way they won't make the faux pas of asking for a free announcement

Nov 12, 2010 12:58 from Okracoke
WASHINGTON (AP) . The Supreme Court on Friday allowed the "don't ask, don't
tell" policy on gays in the military to remain in place while a federal appeals
court considers the issue.

The court did not comment in denying a request from the Log Cabin Republicans,
a gay rights group, to step into the ongoing federal court review of "don't
ask, don't tell." The Obama administration urged the high court not to get
involved at this point.

Last month, a federal judge ruled that the policy violates the civil rights of
gay Americans and she issued an injunction barring the Pentagon from applying
it. But the San Francisco-based appeals court said the policy could remain in
effect while it considers the administration's appeal.

President Barack Obama has pledged to push lawmakers to repeal the law in the
lame-duck session before a new Congress is sworn in. But administration lawyers
have in the meantime defended "don't ask, don't tell" in court.

The policy, which prohibits gays and lesbians from serving openly in the
military, was lifted for eight days in October after U.S. District Judge
Virginia Phillips ruled that it is unconstitutional. The Obama administration
asked the appeals court to reinstate the ban until it could hear arguments on
the broader constitutional issues next year.

Justice Elena Kagan did not take part in the court's consideration of the
issue. Kagan served as the administration's chief Supreme Court lawyer before
she became a justice in August.

Illinois signs civil unions bill into law

(CNN) -- Illinois joined five other states Monday in legalizing civil unions, a
move that will give same sex couples many of the legal protections that are now
granted to married couples.

Governor Pat Quinn signed the law in front a crowd of cheering residents during
a ceremony in a Chicago auditorium.

"Today is an important day in the history of our state because today we are
showing the world that the people of Illinois believe in equality for all,"
Quinn said. "We look forward to individuals and businesses from across the
country choosing to move to Illinois where we believe that everyone is entitled
to the same rights."

The provision which goes in effect on June 1 is calledSenate Bill 1716 and
creates the Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act.

The new law will allow same sex and heterosexual couples to enter into civil
unions granting them many rights given to married couples.

These rights include automatic hospital visitation rights, the ability to make
emergency medical decisions for partners, the ability to share a room in a
nursing home, adoption and parental rights, pension benefits, inheritance
rights, and the right to dispose of a partner's remains, the governor's office
said.

"In addition to Illinois, five other states and the District of Columbia have
civil unions or similar laws on the books. Those states include California,
Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington," the governor's office said.

But some groups in Illinois object to the new law

Illinois Family Institute, a non-profit group that says it wants to reaffirm
marriage in the state, called the law "divisive."

"Gov. Quinn should reject this anti-family bill and reject the efforts of the
homosexual lobby to impose this highly contentious and controversial policy on
the people of Illinois," said David E. Smith, executive director of the group.

But couples like Mercedes Santos and Theresa Volpe said the new law will
dramatically change their lives.

It gives them the rights that other families have when it comes to their
six-year-old daughter and two-year-old son, they told CNN affiliate WLS.

"Our son actually has some illnesses, so going into the hospital, being able to
say that we can both be in the room with him and make decisions without too
many questions, just makes it easier for us," Santos told the affiliate.

I understand the concerns with complications getting new IDs and being flagged

Sorry for the double, this just arrived

Dear Steve,

Amazing! After more than 150,000 petition signatures from Change.org members
and saturation media coverage, news outlets worldwide are reporting that Apple
has pulled an iPhone application launched by Exodus International that claimed
to help "cure" gay and lesbian people.

This is a huge, public victory against the dangerous myth that gay young people
can and should be "turned straight" -- a falsehood that contributes to the
plague of depression and suicide afflicting these kids and young adults. Our
friends at Truth Wins Out, the organization that started the petition on
Change.org, are absolutely thrilled.

Apple did the right thing because an incredible 151,125 Change.org members --
including you -- stood together to demand it. We spread the word on Facebook
more than 55,000 times. And together we attracted the attention of media around
the globe, including CNN, MSNBC, Fox, ABC, CBS, and hundreds of newspapers and
blogs.

It's simply amazing. Thank you for making this victory possible.

- Eden and the Change.org team

P.S. In the past few months, Change.org members have won dozens of victories
like this one, from freeing tortured human rights activists in Bahrain to
pushing the world's largest florist to start selling Fair Trade flowers.
They're all possible because someone, somewhere takes the initiative to start a
campaign to change something important.

Wow. We won!

Tuesday night, Apple dumped Exodus International's "gay cure" iPhone app after
more than 150,000 people joined Truth Wins Out and Change.org in calling for
its removal. The app was pulled by Apple, as they apparently recognized that
Exodus demonizes LGBT people, calling them perverse and saying that
homosexuality will "make your heart sick."

To make this moment possible, Truth Wins Out applied tremendous pressure in the
form of a sustained, two-week-long multimedia campaign that caught the
attention of media outlets around the world, from CNN and MSNBC to the Wall
Street Journal and Guardian UK.

This major victory for the Truth Wins Out community means that Exodus has one
less platform through which to expose LGBT youth to their dangerous, hateful,
and scientifically bankrupt message.

The thing is this isn't accounting.   The problem with birth
certificates, is that they are not really used as "records of
birth".   They used for identification, citizenship status, etc.

There is a long history of the court sealing records for
privacy purposes in many types of cases.

Having an "amended birth certificate" only serves to
"out" sally.  There's no real compelling reason to keep
the old information around, all it does is serve to hamper.

The record itself has no effect on anyone other than the individual.

The main consideration would be fraud, the process and procedure of
gender transition would prevent people from abusing the system and
changing things for fraud purposes.  There is a paper trail (that
doesn't have to be presented to anyone)

There are other information trails that can be used to trace someone,
trails that are more common to look at than birth certificates,
(court ordered changes of name would be one of the first places
someone would look in such instances)

Probably, but my point is that it's not really form of "identification" in the

Why should it be changed if somebody changes genders?  Your sex doesn't change,
even if you go through gender re-assignment procedures.

If the concern is that the person no longer identifies with their birth sex, I
get that, but the birth certificate is not the right place to reinforce the
sense of self.  It's a record, not an ID.

Mississauga high school bans gay-straight alliance
TAMARA BALUJA AND KATE HAMMER
From Friday's Globe and Mail
Published Friday, Mar. 18, 2011 3:00AM EDT
Last updated Friday, Mar. 18, 2011 5:15AM EDT

Fresh on the heels of a neighbouring GTA school board's decision to ban
gay-straight alliances, a group of Mississauga teens were also barred from
launching a gay-straight alliance (GSA) at their Catholic high school.

The group's founder, 16-year-old Leanne Iskander, approached St. Joseph's
Catholic Secondary School principal Frances Jacques to start a gay-straight
alliance recently and was flatly turned down, Xtra! reported Thursday.

The gay and lesbian newspaper reported that Ms. Iskander was told, "There's
already supports in place at the school, such as guidance counsellors. Also, a
GSA is premature for your age."

However, Bruce Campbell, spokesman for Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School
Board told The Globe and Mail Thursday that "the principal did not say that
students could not meet for discussion, but rather asked her [Ms. Iskander] to
work within the many structures in place to meet their needs."

It's a decision that Mr. Campbell said "the board wholeheartedly supports."

It's an approach that brings Catholic Church doctrine more and more into
conflict with the new equity and inclusion policy of Ontario's Ministry of
Education, which says GSAs should be allowed to form.

So far, individual school boards have been allowed to amend the policy as they
see fit, so long as alternative forms of support are offered. The Catholic
boards contend broader groups that support student spirit are suitable
alternatives.

In neighbouring Halton Catholic District School Board, chairwoman Alice LeMay
came under fire recently when she told Xtra! the board "doesn't allow Nazi
groups either. Gay-straight alliances are banned because they are not within
the teachings of the Catholic Church." Public outrage forced the HCDSB to lift
the ban on GSAs, but it still does not allow any student group with the word
"gay" in its title.

Mr. Campbell said the St. Joseph's principal offered to help the 30 interested
students by arranging discussions with the school's chaplain and social worker,
and suggested they join other equity groups already existing in the school or
refer to Courage Toronto, an Archdiocese-supported organization that supports
young people with same-sex orientation.

"The student indicated that she was not interested in faith-based resources,"
Mr. Campbell said. "The principal indicated that, as a Catholic school,
however, it is from a faith-based perspective that we would approach
discussions if this is to move forward, just as a faith perspective is part of
any club or activity at a Catholic school."

In defiance of the school's decision, Ms. Iskander has launched a Facebook
group called St. Joes Gay-Straight Alliance.

Posted on the webpage is a letter sent by Ms. Iskander to the school principal,
in which she writes, "I would like to make it clear that groups such as these
do not in any way impose upon the religious freedom or denominational rights of
the Catholic School Board."

John Martin Tabilin, 18, is an openly gay student at St. Joseph's Secondary
School. He is part of a group of about 30 students who support starting a GSA
at the school.

"It think it's kind of pointless [banning GSAs] because the religion may not
support us [gay and lesbian youth], but we're part of the school community and
they should be creating a more safe environment for us," Mr. Tabilin said. "For
me personally, I've experienced a lot of homophobia, like, I've been bullied.
They don't bully physically but they give you stares, they use discriminatory
words, like they call you 'fag.'"

Ms. Iskander said the group's next move will be to call the Canadian Civil
Liberties Association.

With the exception of abuse, I find it hard to fathom why would anyone
object.

Why should it be changed?   For the protection and privacy of the
individual that this information affects.

This is the same reason that other certificates have birth information
changed.

Look at birth certificates for adopted children.  They often have
the adoptive parents listed, not the original birth parents.

The original certificate may still exist, and be sealed by the court.
This is done for privacy reasons.    They change them for the protection
of the individuals that this information reflects.

Recently there was an incident where an individual was publically mocked
and humiliated by an entire office of DMV workers because they had an 'M'
on their records and looked like an 'F'.  They were made to "male up"
and get the picture taken looking like a man..    And that's just the
tip of the iceberg.   I can come up with a huge list of incidents, where
when one has to present official information and ends up harassed
when outed.     It's not safe to be trans...  And not all of us can
simply blow mistaken records of with "well that is obviously an error".

The court has a long history of changing birth certificates for the
protection of individuals, and even for the convenience of the
individuals (in the case of simple name changes)

There is a paper trail if needed, but not one that needs to be presented
alongside the certificate.

Allowing name changes to "making searches easier" isn't the reason.
You can search off any other info...  Birthdate location, and one other
bit of info will find nearly any certificate without even knowing the
person's name.      It just makes it easier when you have to present
the certificate for something, you don't have to carry along a lot of
other supporting information along with it, and then h ope that
the individual looking at this info thinks it's valid.

Let the court settle it in one place, seal the records, and be done.

"Why should it be changed if somebody changes genders?  Your sex doesn't
change, even if you go through gender re-assignment procedures."

That made me cringe, I'd be hard pressed to come up with something more
insulting there.

Two ways to look at it.
It sounds like you are arguing that a certificate means "a person was born
here with this information".

In reality, what the certificate is most often used to mean is "this person
was born here with this information."

If it were simply a record in a database never to be looked at again
except by a statistician - then it wouldn't matter to anyone at all.

Birth certificates aren't simple historical documents, and they are a form of
identification.  You may have to present your birth certificate in order to
obtain a drivers license.  In Ohio, you need your birth certificate in order to
apply for public assistance programs.  Birth certificates are considered proof
of citizenship in that you were born in the U.S.

When Jennifer Smith goes to Job and Family services for her face-to-face
appointment (required in Ohio) to apply for Medicaid and presents a birth
certificate that identifies her as John Smith, that's a problem.  Even if you
present records of your legal name change, you're still in legal limbo for some
programs.  For example, can Jennifer apply for WIC benefits for herself and her
2 year old son?  (WIC = Women Infants and Children)  She may not qualify since
her birth certificate identifies her as male, and at the very least it's going
to turn an already unpleasant process of trying to get help into a nightmare as
she has to justify her appearance and conflicting documents over and over
again.

If Jennifer Smith is arrested, does she wind up in lock up with men or women?
Her photo ID is likely to list her as male if she resides in a state which
doesn't allow the birth record to be amended.

The reality is this - birth certificates force families into choosing between a
false dichotomy of male vs. female...even in cases which an infant is not
clearly either.  About 1 in 100 children are born with some level of
chromosomal or physical abnormality that results in the child not clearly
meeting the traditional definition of "male" or "female".  Some of these
situations are evident based on the infant's appearance, while other issues may
be at the chromosomal level and not have major impact on physical appearance.

Why insist that the birth record is accurate when an argument can be made that
in about 1% of cases we know that it isn't?  That sometimes it's really just
the physician and parents' best guess?  This is the standard we want to cling
to in order to deny transgender individuals the ability to have their
documentation match the gender they identify with in their work, personal
lives, legal records, and so on?  C'mon.

She is talking about both 2 and 3 I think. The folks in category 2 get royally
screwed across the board - by doctors with god complexes, by bigoted states
which refuse to update the birth certificate's accuracy, by parents who were
pressured by doctors to push the child in one role or another, again by doctors
who make documentation in medical records vague so they are "legally"
accurate but intellectually dishonest (i.e., referring to abnormal genitalia as
"benign tumors" or hypospadias as a "hernia" - /technically/ accurate perhaps,
but isn't a specific description), and then we get screwed by health providers
who will treat TG folk but not cover IS folk - why? Because transsexualism is a
mental disorder and the treatment is HRT and surgery, but for IS folk it's
cosmetic and therefore elective.    Then, we're getting screwed by so called
"marriage protection" laws, where if the legislation is enforced as written
(much of that legislation is "a woman born a woman may marry a man born a man"
or phrasing to that effect) then we intersex folk would not be able to legally
marry anyone.

Where a simple M or F is inaccurate it should be fixed. Not amended as in added
on but the original document updated/replaced with the accurate information,
especially where doctors fucked up. Or, perhaps an I or H (intersex or
hermaphrodite) classification needs to be added - but then bigots will be
bigots and will discriminate based on that classification.

It sucks.

TL pretty much summed up what I mean.  I'm not talking about clerical errors.
Those can be amended.

Rather, about 1% of children do not fall into what we typically may think of as
"male" or "female".  This may be a function of anatomical ambiguity (basically,
the doctor can't define sex by looking), or it may be a function of chromosomal
differences which result in a child who does not - at the genetic level - have
a clear "XY" or "XX" designation.  Perhaps they are XXY.  Perhaps there are
just some mutations on one leg of an "X" that transforms an "XY" or an "XX"
into neither an "XX" nor an "XY".

In any case, those situations occur in about 1 in 100 births in the U.S.  In
many cases, if the difference is at the chromosomal level but external
genitalia appears clearly male or female -- the difference may never really be
known.  In other cases, it is quite clear from birth.

Personally, I disagree with Lady Gaga. I think God makes mistakes all the time.

would probably contribute to these charities (probably without even realizing
the cognitive dissonance).
The problem is that Lady Gaga didn't think her logic through. her silly
ideology brings up a schism. If being gay is biological, and perfectly
acceptable as is, and has no need to be "fixed" by a heterosexual majority
society, then isn't the transgender state the same? should transgender
individuals be "happy" with their biology? why have gender reassignment
surgery? Transgender idenity is biological, and not a choice. Homosexuality is
(by the majority of gays) considered biological, and not a choice.

That argument either tears the community apart, for forces a reconsideration on
the nature of homosexuality and free will.

When I had sex ed in school, homosexuality wasn't brought up either.  We saw a
diagram of a penis, a diagram of a vagina, and were then inundated with STD
information.  I can't say it was all that useful, honestly.  They could've at
least explained the G-spot, or what kind of lubrication works best.

Has sexual education changed to include culture since the early 90's?  I also
wonder if Ms. Campfield is concerned about the age at which these topics can
come up in school, or if teachers will be sharing their opinion on the subject.

That's a fallacy of category. anatomical is biological intrinsically.

More importantly, transgender person who want gender reassignment have a gender
preference, which is biological in nature. If there wasn't a pyschological urge
to be a specific gender, they wouldn't be paying to have gender reassignment
surgery. If it wasn't biological, then it's a matter of free will.

Aug 9, 2011 20:54 from Okracoke
from the SF Chronicle:

Citing the Defense of Marriage Act, the Obama administration denied immigration
benefits to a married gay couple from San Francisco and ordered the expulsion
of a man who is the primary caregiver to his AIDS-afflicted spouse.

Bradford Wells, a U.S. citizen, and Anthony John Makk, a citizen of Australia,
were married seven years ago in Massachusetts. They have lived together 19
years, mostly in an apartment in the Castro district. The U.S. Citizenship and
Immigration Services denied Makk's application to be considered for permanent
residency as a spouse of an American citizen, citing the 1996 law that denies
all federal benefits to same-sex couples.

The decision was issued July 26. Immigration Equality, a gay-rights group that
is working with the couple, received the notice Friday and made it public
Monday. Makk was ordered to depart the United States by Aug. 25. Makk is the
sole caregiver for Wells, who has severe health problems.

"I'm married just like any other married person in this country," Wells said.
"At this point, the government can come in and take my husband and deport him.
It's infuriating. It's upsetting. I have no power, no right to keep my husband
in this country. I love this country, I live here, I pay taxes and I have no
right to share my home with the person I married."
Husband's pleas

Wells pleaded with Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and President
Obama to intervene.

"Anyone can identify with the horror of having the government come in and
destroy your family when you've done nothing wrong, and you've done everything
right, followed every law," Wells said.

The agency's decision cited the Defense of Marriage Act as the reason for the
denial of an I-130 visa, or spousal petition that could allow Makk to apply for
permanent U.S. residency. "The claimed relationship between the petitioner and
the beneficiary is not a petitionable relationship," the decision said. "For a
relationship to qualify as a marriage for purposes of federal law, one partner
must be a man and the other a woman."

Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder decided earlier this year that the law,
commonly known as DOMA, is unconstitutional on equal protection grounds and
that the administration would no longer defend it in court. House Republicans
hired an outside counsel to defend it instead. However, the administration said
it would continue to enforce the law, while exercising discretion on a
case-by-case basis.

ICE's director, John Morton, issued a memorandum in June that offered guidance
to agents in making enforcement decisions. Because no law enforcement agency
can pursue every case, they routinely prioritize where to commit the
government's limited resources.

The memorandum said prosecutions should seek to promote "national security,
border security, public safety and the integrity of the immigration system."

Makk meets several of the circumstances specified in the memorandum. Aside from
being a spouse of an American citizen, he is also the primary caretaker of a
citizen, has no criminal history, and has legally resided in the country under
various visas for many years.

The couple said they spent nearly $2,000 to file the petition that was denied,
and now must decide whether to file a motion to reconsider the decision, which
Wells said would almost certainly be denied, giving the couple at most another
30 days of residency.

Makk gave up a professional career in Australia to be with Wells, and started a
business in San Francisco and invested in rental property to meet various visa
requirements. He said he has never remained in the country illegally.
Poor alternatives

Wells could move to Australia, but he said doing so would require him to give
up his extensive medical care and insurance in the United States.

"We are appealing to the Obama administration to begin to put into action what
they've said repeatedly they can do," said Immigration Equality spokesman Steve
Ralls. "The Department of Homeland Security and ICE have said again and again
that they can exercise discretion in individual cases, but they have not done
so for a single gay or lesbian couple yet."

In rare cases, lawmakers can introduce so-called private bills to shield
specific immigrants from deportation, but only after deportation proceedings
have begun. Such bills are considered a last resort.

Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, said Pelosi
has contacted immigration officials on behalf of the couple and "will be
working to exhaust all appropriate immigration remedies that are open to
pursue."

Seven Views of Coming Out at Work

By Dennis McCafferty on 2011-11-02

The vast majority of Americans feel that employees should be evaluated based on
performance and not their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to a
survey from Out & Equal Workplace Advocates. While gay, lesbian, bisexual and
transgender (GLBT) adults are more open than in years past with co-workers and
supervisors, their comfort level at work lags in comparison to that felt with
family and friends. Bisexuals have considerably more difficulty with this issue
in the workplace than gays and lesbians. "These numbers show us that there is
still work to do before people are comfortable being open about their sexual
orientation at work," says Selisse Berry, executive director of Out & Equal
Workplace Advocates. "In particular, more needs to be done to ensure that
bisexuals can disclose their identities safely. The discrimination that
bisexual people face in the workplace is sometimes overlooked or dismissed."
More than 2,600 U.S. adults (including 304 who identified themselves as LGBT)
took part in the research, which was conducted by Harris Interactive.

least a pseudo-public good, ought to be subject to stricter regulations, such

My personal opinion is, "no," because programming choices get too much into
what amounts to a pure business decision, and I think it's fundamentally

"I don't know what you mean by "clearly derogatory racial statement"."

  Are you sure?  Those are all English terms with well-known meanings.

  No matter, I'll break it down for you:

  I assume you know what a statement is.  If not, please correct me.

  By "derrogatory" I mean that the speaker intended that statement to be
  insulting, unflattering, or otherwise impart to the listener a negative
  connotation about the subject of the statement.

  By "racially" I mean that the statement pertained or related to, or in
  some fashion invoked the race of, the subject of the statement.

  By "clearly" I mean that the nature of the statement as being both
  derrogatory and racial is patent, not latent.

  Does that clear up your confusion about the meaning of that phrase?

I can believe that Imus genuinely believes he was not being racially insulting,

"What you claim to be an easy statement to understand turns out to be a pretty

  It is a very easy statement to understand.  It only becomes complex when

  I agree that reasonable minds can differ as to whether a given statement
  is intended by its author to be racially derrogatory.

  I'm telling you that when a guy refers to a team of mostly black female
  basketball players as "nappy-headed hos," there would be little reasonable
  disagreement as to whether this statement is perceived as racially
  derrogatory.  And I further submit that there would be little reasonable
  disagreement over whether the person making that statement intended to be
  racially derrogatory, or at least made the statement in utter disregard of
  whether it was racially derrogatory.

"In other words, what is a "clearly derogatory statement" (dropping the
"racial" so as to make the discussion on topic for the forum) is unknown and,
at best, simply guessed at."

  Obviously, what a person meant or thought can be never known as a fact.
  Even if the person admits he meant a particular thing, he could be lying.
  It can never be known.

  But it can be reasonably surmised, given the statement, context, subject,
  and history of the speaker, what was meant, and the law routinely makes
  inferences about what people "meant."

  If you put this to 100 different juries, at least 90 of them are going to
  decide he meant to be racially insulting.

  Your hand-waving to the contrary here is hypertechnical blatherskite
  obscuring plain meaning in overwrought rhetorical analysis to draw what
  looks to be a strained comparison.  We are, after all, in LesBiGayTrans
  and are discussing race.

If the producers of Snoop Dogg albums were concerned about their image, they

On top of that, what Snoop Dogg (or any hip hop artist) says in their work is
quite a different story from what a broadcaster says on sports radio.

Those that are offended by Snoop's statements on women have the choice to not
buy his music.  If enough people don't, he doesn't sell, and his record label
drops him.

When a white man, talking about a COLLEGE sports team, makes the 'nappy headed
hos' comment, he's denigrating (pun intended) them as blacks and as women.  Why
do we need to hear that when you're doing color commentary for a basketball
game?

"Does "clearly derogatory" mean "the speaker meant it to be offensive" or does
it mean "the majority of people think he meant to be offensive"?"

  You're into theories of language now, and I'm a firm believer in the
  Hayakawa theory of language.  As such, by definition a statement is offensive
  if people who hear it find it offensive.  I'll argue that a statement is
  clearly offensive is the majority of people who hear it are offended.

  Whether the speaker believed or intended it to be offensive has to do with
  our assessment of what kind of person he is and context of its use, I'd
  say, but it's not otherwise pertinent to whether the statement is offensive.

  That said, a person's intent, when clear enough, can render an offensive
  statement inoffensive.  For example, when I walk into a gay friend's
  apartment, look around, and say, "This place is so queer" with a bit
  shiteating grin, even though that statement is offensive, my friends is not
  offended because of the context.  That is, he can infer something from
  context that makes the statement not offensive.

  So, intent bears on whether the listener finds the statement offensive,
  but the question is what a reasonable listener would infer from the
  behavior of the speaker, not what the speaker meant in his heart of hearts.

"How does the speaker know if the majority of people think he meant it to be
offensive until after he says it?  And was a poll taken?"

  He doesn't, necessarily.  That's why people sometimes say things that are
  offensive without intending to offend anybody.

"The fact is that our society is schizophrenic with regards to what is "clearly
derogatory" and what isn't."

  If so, it's because what we perceive as offensive is not based on rationality
  or logic, but primarily on emotional responses to words, which I argue are
  inherently irrational.  When we hear a statement, which is no more than
  mechanical waves hitting our eardrums, those waves are translated into
  auditory information that is processed by the brain, and associated with
  an emotional response.  Base emotional responses, like anger, generally
  originate in lower-levels of brain activity, such as the brain stem, which
  sidesteps all of our rational thought processes.

  It's not a failing with "society" so much as human cognition.

""nappy headed hoes" can end a career, but "Bitches ain't **** but ho's and
tricks, lick on these balls and suck the dick" (snoop dogg) is money making."

  Again, context matters.  Look at how much racially offensive nonsense
  Daniel Tosh offers up on his show each week, yet very few people appear
  to be genuinely offended because of the context -- they know it's all
  tongue-in-cheek.  His show is insanely popular with black viewers
  specifically because he takes cheap shots at black culture in a playful
  manner.

  Yet Bill Cosby takes shots at black culture, and he catches some
  flak for it, because he genuinely intended to be critical.

"Does that make it okay - because the majority of people didn't protest it?"

  Yes, by definition.  If you're talking about what is acceptable as free
  expression, then yes, absolutely, by definition.

"I'm not defending Imus.  I'm saying that the whole "'clearly derogatory' is
simple" claim is bull."

  Well, I disagree.  It's clearly a derrogatory statement.  So is Snoop
  Dogg's statement.  The question is whether it's offensive.

  If I call Steppenwolf an ivory tower intellectual dork, he's not likely
  to take offense.  For one, he knows that I am also an ivory tower
  intellectual dork, and that I mean the chide affectionately.

  But you can imagine a number of other people who, if they made that same
  charge, would be offensive saying the same thing.

  You are basically trying to come up with parsing rule whereby a word
  can be determined to be patently offensive and my opinion is that
  language is not subject to such interpretation.

  Even words like 'cunt' and 'fuck' can be rendered unoffensive in
  context.

Lochner> I've been basing my comments in this discussion on theories of

None of what you said in your last post indicates that "clearly derogatory" is
simple.  It shows the opposite.  People decide what is "clearly derogatory"
based on the speaker, the message, the environment, and other factors which
interact with each other in very complicated ways.  People have different
opinions of what is "clearly derogatory".  You claim that "reasonable people"
tend to agree with each other.  I think, in praxis, we tend to define
"reasonable people" as "people who agree with us".
And the fact that everything changes over time is pretty significant because it
means that some statement made by some speaker in some environment will move
from being perceived as derogatory to not derogatory to derogatory again.  How
exactly is that that "that's so gay" became a casual statement that most people
didn't think of as derogatory to a statement which more and more people see as
derogatory?  Its not simple.  Its far from simple.  Its pretty damn complex and
has no one right answer.  You claim that rappers aren't thought of as being
serious when they make misogynistic remarks, but how many rappers have had
assault charges brought against them?

"None of what you said in your last post indicates that "clearly derogatory" is

  It is simple.  A statement is not inherently derragotory or note.

  Whether it's derrogatory is a function of the listener's perception.

  The speaker's apparent intent is a factor that may influences the listener's
  perception.

  It's derrogatory if the listener thinks it is.
  It's clearly derrogatory if most listeners think it is.

  If you don't mind, can you tell me what your larger point is.  In typical
  Bodhi Dharma fashion, you've not only lost the forest while copping a feel

  Is there a "double standard" out there in what is tolerable speech?

  Of course there is, because our standards are not rational.

  If that's your point, I agree.

  Regardless, Don Imus's comments were clearly derrogatory.

  You're wrong.

Chicago Archbishop Cardinal Francis George just apologized for comparing the
LGBT community to the Ku Klux Klan.

"I am truly sorry for the hurt my remarks have caused," George said in an
interview with the Chicago Tribune. "Particularly because we all have friends
or family members who are gay and lesbian. This has evidently wounded a good
number of people.  I  have family members myself who are gay and lesbian, so
it's part of our lives. So I'm sorry for the hurt. When I was talking I was
speaking out of fear that I have for the church's liberty and I was reaching
for an analogy which was very inappropriate for which I'm sorry. I didn't
realize the impact of what I was saying...Sometimes fear is a bad motivation."

While we called for Cardinal George's resignation, we think remorse is a
positive step in the right direction. It is gratifying to see the Cardinal take
personal responsibility for the hurt he has caused and we hope this incident
leads to improving relations with the LGBT community.

Truth Wins Out would like to thank our readers for signing our petition (5,400
people signed) that called on Cardinal George to resign. We are also grateful
to those who contributed financially to help us place a full-page ad in last
Sunday's Chicago Tribune headlined, "Hey, Cardinal Francis George, Gay is not
like the KKK." This ad played a critical role because it kept the controversy
-- thus the public pressure -- alive during the holidays.

When we work together, we can create lasting change and achieve real progress.

This is infuriating and makes my blood boil.

In Brownsville, Tenn., Haywood High School principal Dorothy Bond told gay
students that they were "not on God's path." According to reports, the
obnoxious and offensive comments were made at a school assembly. Bond allegedly
told students that gay people are "ruining their lives," and she said public
displays of affection among gay students could result in 60-day suspensions and
even expulsion.

The ACLU says that this is not the first time Bond has made homophobic remarks,
once telling a lesbian student that she would "go to hell" for being gay. Bond
also reportedly has incorporated prayers and proselytizing into school events.

This unconstitutional, anti-gay abuse has no place in America's public schools.
Instead of doing her job by nurturing and protecting all students, Bond is
singling out LGBT teenagers for ridicule and acting like a schoolyard bully.

Now is your chance to tell Bond to "Go to hell."

Please tell the school board that Bond must be immediately fired for her
outrageous comments and unprofessional, if not illegal, conduct. Clearly, she
is unfit to serve in a neutral environment without forcing her backward views
down the throats of vulnerable children.

TWO Echoes GLAAD's Call For Station To Discipline Morning Radio Personality

CLEVELAND - Truth Wins Out called on WMMS, a Clear Channel radio station in
Cleveland, to suspend or fire radio personality DJ Dominic Dieter for
reportedly telling a father he should arrange to have his daughter raped to
turn her heterosexual. The noxious comments on the Rover's Morning Glory show
came in response to an email from a father who was upset when he came across
his daughter kissing a girl. DJ Dominic Deiter declared on the air, "You should
get one of your friends to screw your daughter straight."
"These comments are as unfunny as they are unconscionable," said Truth Wins
Out's Executive Director Wayne Besen. "We call on WMMS and Clear Channel to
immediately take action and hold DJ Deiter accountable for his grotesque and
unprofessional actions. Deiter's remarks were particularly troubling because
so-called  'corrective rape' is actually an 'ex-gay' technique used on lesbians
in some countries."
Earlier, The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) called on
Clear Channel to hold Dieter accountable for his comment.
"It was appalling and dangerous for this show to tell a father that he should
have one of his friends rape his daughter," said Aaron McQuade, director of
News & Field Media at GLAAD. "That's essentially how Dieter responded to this
listener, and this is no laughing matter in a world where people are too often
the victims of violence and sexual assault based on their actual or perceived
sexual orientation. And Dieter gave this vile advice to everyone who was
listening, including educators, parents and children - sending the message that
it's okay to physically or sexually abuse people who are perceived to be gay."
Truth Wins Out is a nonprofit organization that fights anti-LGBT extremism. TWO
specializes in turning information into action by organizing, advocating and
fighting for LGBT equality.

The bigots win: North Carolina passes Amendment One
byKaili Joy Gray

Sadly, as predicted, voters in North Carolina passed Amendment One, the law
that bans already-banned same-sex marriage and tacks on a gratuitous "and no
civil unions, either." As Joan McCarter explained:
There would be no more legal unions between unmarried people, gay or straight.
It could take health care benefits away from families, it could take away
domestic violence protections, hospital visitation rights, and all the very
basic protections of civil unions.
That's why just about everyone--including North Carolina Gov. Bev Perdue,
former President Bill Clinton (and his daughter), Episcopal bishops, hundreds
of business leaders, religious leaders, and members of both parties--opposed
it. Because it's hateful and wrong. But apparently, the state's voters
disagreed.
Way to go, North Carolina. You must be so proud.

TWO Sickened By Brutal Shooting of Lesbian Couple In Portland, Texas

Heartbreak and Horror in Texas Shocks Nation, Says TWO

Burlington, Vt. - Truth Wins Out called for swift justice today after two
teenage girls in a five-month relationship were shot in a Portland, Texas park
with one of the girls dying from head injuries.

Mollie Judith Olgin, 19, and Mary Christine Chapa, 18, were found in knee-deep
grass in a nature area in Portland on Saturday. Olgin, who recently moved to
Corpus Christi, died; Chapa, of Sinton, was taken to the hospital where she had
surgery and is listed in serious but stable condition, according to local NBC
affiliate kristv.com.

"We call on the police and public officials in Portland to ensure that justice
is served and the savages behind this sadistic slaying are placed behind bars,"
said Truth Wins Out Executive Director Wayne Besen. "We are deeply saddened by
the heartbreak and horror that just occurred in Texas. We hope that Chapa fully
recovers and our thoughts are with both families in this tragic time."

Truth Wins Out is a nonprofit organization that fights anti-LGBT extremism. TWO
specializes in turning information into action by organizing, advocating and
fighting for LGBT equality.

gets into everything, or can at least. JL mentioned science, there's another
place you get it if you really think about it, the popular books on quantum
mechanics being a good example. So you know, I'm not so much thinking of,
"here's why I read Kant, he's awesome because ...", though if you've got
something like that, that's cool too. Nor am I thinking specifically of "first
I read this, then I got into that, and then ..."

It doesn't really matter to me if you can figure out where or how you got into
this stuff. I'm kind of going more for, what inspired you? What were really
awesome ideas when you found them? Got any good quotes you think need sharing?
Of course we're getting some good reading recommendations too, and that's
awesome. But I'm definitely thinking of the most expansive version of the
question here. Did linguistics make you think about something else in the
world? Cool, I'd love to hear about it. Because clearly, there are
philosophical extrapolations to be made from linguistics, for example.

It seems to me that philosophical thought is the natural result of an
inquisitive mind. No matter which direction you come from, if you keep asking
questions, you arrive at philosophy.

There is a quote to that extend, but I can't remember or find it. It's
something about philosophy being something you arrive at because your
experience demands it. Maybe it was in the Black Swan? I forget.


Personally, I came from a fundamentalist religious background, but my
scientific mind caused me to question everything. At some point, I realized
that I could question what was being taught, which opened up my mind to be able
to question EVERYTHING. I have a scientific mind by nature, so my interest in
math, science, physics, etc dug me deep into the hole of lots of fundamental
questions, which eventually leads to philosophy. Although I took a few
philosophy classes in college (lame), they focused more on memorizing the views
of Kant, etc, and not really THINKING. So once I came back around to it from a
different angle, I read more of that stuff. I have read bits and pieces of
classical stuff, and modern stuff, but my views are mainly driven by thinking
and exploring ideas, not by reading what someone else wrote.

Can we transcend our human mind and become aware of, participate in, and

I'm not talking about religion, though that might be seen as a way to approach
this.

I'm thinking more along the lines of a consciousness that is at a higher level,
formed through our individual interactions and connections. As if each of our
brains is a neuron in a larger brain. Or life itself can "think" at a level
beyond what we observe. As if we are an intelligent micro-chip that could
somehow figure out that it's part of a computer, and maybe start to grasp the
idea that our individual processes are part of a bigger calculation.


Could we even comprehend a higher level of consciousness, or is it forever
hidden from our perspective?
When we feel part of something bigger, are we actually experiencing it, or are
we deluding ourselves?


I've been thinking and reading more on this topic, and it really seems like a

of ideas or thoughts or insights othes may have had on these kinds of

I suppose this is ultimately unknowable, but seems unlikely.

Hilariously, though: what if we were able to _deduce_ we were in a higher
consciousness without actively taking part in it? And would that deduction
itself be part of the analogue to electronic activity in its own brain?

I sense a book. MEanining someone has already written it. But "neuron analogues

Why dismiss religion? I'm not suggesting you go convert to something. I'm just
suggesting that religion, mysticism specifically, has been talking about what
you're talking about for quite a long time now. Also shamanism. You might get
nothing whatsoever out of that, you seem to have a real thing for expressing
everything in terms of computers. But it seems like it would at least be worth
a look. In fact, I'll go one better and say I swear I've seen stuff like what
you're talking about connected to both, unfortunately, I have no idea where.
That sort of thing doesn't interest me at all. I'm not a microchip, so I don't
care to attempt to think like one. You might take a look at technopaganism
though, if any of them have bothered getting off their asses and writing any
coherent philosophy, they hadn't last time I checked, but that was ages ago
and, to be fair to them, probably right around when the whole thing was coming
together from the stage of "here are a bunch of random people who just found
out they share similar ideas".



I suggest something like this for two reasons. One is, of course, you don't
have to reinvent the wheel. The other is that they might actually have some
sort of technique for achieving this, or at least, attempting to achieve it. I
figure even if I end up inventing my own thing and not going in somebody else's
direction, it's always worth finding out what's going on with other people
first. That's primarily because I've discovered, over the years, that there's
no way in hell I can think of everything all by myself. But I also ahve enough
of an independent mind that I don't feel bound to whatever somebody's come up
with first.

For instance, I've been tackling Native American flute again. A friend has one,
and he plays with a bunch of slides. The instrument's actually really good for
slides, but I don't particularly enjoy his use of them, it's not really what
you hear in a lot of traditional music. Similarly, one thing you do hear in a
fair number of traditional players is vibrato, as soon as a note gets held for
any length of time, people will start doing vibrato on it. I actually don't
like that either, I think it's way overused. However, I know how to use both
techniques, even though I rarely do.

So I look at things in terms of music. I can't come up with every musical thing
ever done on an instrument, even something that "seems" restricted like the
Native American flute, typically you have six notes, pentatonic minor plus the
octave, many flutes don't go past that. So you literally are playing within six
notes, seven if you're lucky. But I'm still hearing players who are doing
things I never would have come up with on my own.

Now obviously I have to have an interest in some new sound/technique to learn
it, so I'm not suggesting you pursue something you have no interest in just for
the hell of it. I'm just trying to articulate where my approach is coming from.
It seems to me that many places might TALK about the kind of thing you're
discussing, maybe we can do it, but won't really talk about HOW we might end up
doing it. And if you're not at least trying, what's the point? Because sure,
it's possible that some day we could become aware that we're part of a larger
consciousness. If you think it isn't you'll have to do some heavy lifting to
convince me to deny the possibility. I think just about anything's "possible".
It's possible we'll be able to genetically engineer humans with wings who can
fly around unaided. But I'm not sure what that possibility does for me, unless
it's inspiring me to investigate it or create art with it or investigate
something else that arises as a tangential consideration or ... you get the
idea.

Gwynn> I dismiss religion because I think it adds lots of flavor to the
concepts which aren't necessary or fundamental. Like I said, it seems like
religion is one way people approach this concept, but I'm not inspired by most
of it. I prefer to think about it in a more purified form, not as a human
ritual type thing. I don't think religion or mysticism is worthless. I just
think of it like an old black and white photo of the concept, whereas I'm
trying to see it in HD. Or something.

I do like reading alternate ideas, though. That's how I came around to
accepting and kind of understanding religion from a different direction,
actually. Instead of thinking "oh, that's wrong, how stupid!", I can think,
"oh, that might actually be a low-resolution approximation of something
fundamentally true!"
Like an optical illusion. There are two ways to see it, but it's the same
picture. Some people just don't realize that there are two ways, or that they
ARE the same thing.


When I think about the idea of a larger consciousness, I find my mind
'snapping' back and forth between perspectives. I feel like I get glimpses of
the bigger picture, but I snap back to my own perspective and can't sustain the
other view.


To stick with music rather than optical illusions (better for you I suppose,
Gwynn), it's like we are stuck in the perspective of one instrument. We are a
french horn, playing repetitive tunes. We are compelled to follow a pattern,
and it seems like we are choosing which notes we play.

But when we really examine it, we wonder if we are part of a bigger orchestra.
We start to imagine that there *could* be trumpets, because that would
compliment our part so well. We close our eyes and play our part, and imagine
several instruments playing with us. Maybe we *are* part of a bigger song!
Maybe there is a melody! Maybe there are other instruments! Maybe there *is* a
conductor!

But then we snap back, because we can only really comprehend french horns,
because that's all we have ever known. We don't even know what a trumpet would
be. We can suppose there might be one, but how can we know the melody of the
orchestra if we can only ever hear our french horn?

Can we somehow listen to the whole piece? Can we infer the rest of the
orchestra? Can we play as if we are a part of a whole, rather than a lone
instrument? Does our part make so much more sense when viewed as part of the
whole?


So for me, instruments = thoughts. There is a melody of consciousness that's
out there, I'm pretty sure. But all I can hear are human thoughts, so it's hard
to listen outside myself. And whatever I think may end up being my own
insanity, rather than truly seeing something bigger :)

This is an honest question. If religion is the grainy old-timy photograph, and
computers and microchip analogies, or whatever you like, are the HD TV of this
discussion, what's coming from HD TV land to get you there? Because I've read
at least some of the stuff you've mentioned. So I mean, I've seen some of those
same ideas. But I don't see any practical instruction coming out fo that stuff.
I don't see any method for even accessing that state, let alone sustaining it.
BTW I'd argue that sustaining it would probably not be very good, it's probably
hard to do every day things if you're zoned out on being a part of the entire
universe. But sustaining it for more than a minute or something? Sure.

Again, I'm not pushing religion as such. I'm just saying that it's the only
place I've seen techniques, e.g. let's say Buddhist meditation, for getting at
the sort of thing you're talking about. So it sort of seems to me like you're
going, "I want to understand orchestral composition, but I don't want any of
that boring old classical music. Give me music generated by holograms, that's
cool". But I'm not sure the music generated by holograms is out there for you
to find. But it also shouldn't have to be. You can learn what you choose from
classical stuff, then apply that to touch-activated midi controllers driving a
synth whose tones are governed by fractals, or whatever you want to do.

Your music analogy is interesting, so I'll respond with a musical story of my
own, though I confess I'm not sure where it fits in your analogy. I don't
really like orchestras. Or most choirs. To take choirs, I generally find that
the more voices you have singing, the less intelligible they become. I'm not
talking multiple conflicting parts here either. I'm saying that 500 people
singing "Happy Birthday" is less intelligible to me than 5 people singing it.
To be fair, I'd probably get HB because it's so recognizable I could get it
from the melody. But you get the point I hope. So I've been pretty into solo
stuff, or really small groups. Recently I've gotten into minimalism, lots of
drones and stuff. So I was talking to a friend about guitar one day.

  Me: I've been playing around and I think it's interesting that you hear
dissonance differently depending on pitch.
  Him: Like what?
  Me: If I play a D and an E, they sound different depending on the pitch. You
hear more clashing if the pitch is lower.
  Him: I still don't get it.
  Me: hang on, here's a recording.
  Him: Oh wow. I didn't know about that. Well I mean I did but I thought you
only used that for tuning, I didn't think you could actually DO anything with
it.

you can do this experiment pretty easily yourself, I'll bet you can find a
virtual piano online. Play a C and a C#, i.e. the black key just to the right
of C. Play them really low down, then go up an octave, then another, then
another. What you want to listen for are the beat frequencies, i.e. that wobbly
clashing sound. It will sound different as you change octaves. I guess I'd say
I'm kind of taking the position of Confucius when somebody asked him about life
after death or such. He basically said "you don't even understand this life,
why are you worried about the next one"? I guess I wonder how well we even
understand our own consciousness, and/or interactions between it and other
consciousnesses, that we should be going, "yeah, what's next"?

I guess my analogy with sound would be something like, we've been looking for
flashy stuff like the orchestra, it's gotta be bigger and better and faster and
louder, (thank you Dennis Leary), but in focusing on that, we often miss things
about that French horn we think we've been playing well enough all these years.
That's not to say we should go focus on that and ignore everything else, of
course. But I'd argue there's a real danger that we'll head off to orchestra
land before we've got a decent understanding of our French horn, to use your
analogy. BTW, feel free to go with visual stuff if you're more comfortable,
it's a challenge for me, and that's good too.

Gwynn, I don't really have a rebuttal, as I don't see this as a debate as much
as an opportunity to express different views :)

I see your questions as kind of asking where we should focus between wholism
and reductionism. The orchestra can play a beautiful song, but the song is just
made out of individual notes. The notes know nothing of the song, yet the song
cannot exist without them. Does the song not exist, then? Sure it does. It's
just a unique arrangement of notes, which has its own purpose.

I think we can view our own existence from either perspective. We are a
complex sum of our parts. We don't know about all of our cells, but they are
what make us.

Surely we are also just a part of something bigger, which cannot exist without
us. But we know not of it, nor it of us. We are separated by a void of
perspective.


I think also about those 3D artworks, where you cross your eyes and a picture
emerges. The picture was there all along, wasn't it? You just can't see it
until you change your perspective. When you see it, it 'snaps in', and suddenly
you are aware of it. But that's not your natural state, and you can easily
'snap back' to the normal view of the art, which seems like it has no order.
You've gotten a glimpse of something that was there all along, but it's not
your natural perspective, and you can't sustain it long.


Btw, I'm not saying technology are computers are a fair analogy for
consciousness. I just relate to that. I do find it more useful than religion,
though, because it *does* create useful things.

For example, there is a lot of research going on about sentiment analysis, and
using Big Data like all the social media traffic to get a glimpse of what the
world "thinks" about things. Some hedge funds even use this to predict markets,
because they say they know what the world is thinking before the individuals
even realize it, based on the sum of all the little communications happening.

They are listening to all the individual parts, and deriving the melody. Then
profiting from it, of course, because they know which notes come next :)


A lot of science is actually benefiting from this wholistic approach. Many
health issues are better understood when the whole body is taken into
consideration, along with environment, psychology, etc. The more factors we
consider, the bigger umbrella we need to use to cover it all, and before you
know it we're factoring in the world! Could this not be seen as one big
organism?


Anyway, I'm rambling, which is basically how my chaotic brain works :)  I'd
like to hear more thoughts, especially from others.

Your post, Gwynn, made me think of a discussion I had with a friend over lunch
yesterday. It goes back to things I've said here in the past.

There are multiple ways to view the world. We all put our observations into
some box, some model, and think of the world that way. For any given
phenomenon, there may be many ways to "explain" it. Science, religion,
mysticism, philosophy, etc.

So, given so many perspectives and so many models, how does a person go about
picking one?

Clearly, they are not all the same. Is there a way to evaluate the models and
pick one to accept or work from? And if so, what is the criteria for picking a
model?

When I see a rainbow, I may explain it in terms of light scattering.
When someone else sees a rainbow, they may explain it in terms of God promising
them something.

Which one do we pick?
Do we accept ALL models?

I say your chid has cancer and needs treatment. You say your child doesn't pray
enough, and God is making him sick.

Is one model better? Should we accept ALL explanations of everything?

Okay, read the whole article. I don't think it really said much.

* Science thinks it knows more than it does
  Okay, I think many scientists admit that already. I just read something
  yesterday about how scientific papers are fundamentally flawed, and the whole
  peer-review process isn't what people think it is. Luckily, the scientific
  process applies to *science itself*, so the process continues to evolve.


I think one of the root problems is the desire to distinguish between
Philosophy and Science.

IMO, Science is Philosophy 2.0. They are just two versions of the same thing,
and a lot of good science is philosophical in nature. Why is there a need to
put them against each other?

I think that what science does it take some of the questions of philosophy that
seemed unanswerable before, and starts to give some clarity to the answers. We
can start ruling out some answers, because we know more.


The whole article seems to just be irrelevant to me. It's trying to defend one
thing and punch holes in another, when there is no need to do either. It just
seems misguided.

I meant the article it linked to, yes. I included the original because he
referenced another post, which may or may not be useful.

Jl:

But see, I think you're missing the point. It's not just that science knows
more than it thinks it knows. It's that science thinks it's answering these
questions when it isn't, or ignoring them entirely. E.g. if I say "God created
stuff", that's bad because I just have another question, whence God? But if I
say "oh the quantum vacuum did it", that's fine because that's just what the
quantum vacuum does yo. Except it's not fine at all, for the same reason.
Whence the quantum vacuum? Why does it just DO that?

Each answer actually suffers from the same philosophical problem, assuming of
course you think that sort of thing is actually a problem. But if you have an
issue with infinite regression, than so far as I can tell, you ultimately have
an issue with causation, as most people understand it, including the people who
object to God as an answer.

Now maybe the difference for you is that the scientist is saying "well we don't
know now, but maybe we will", while you feel the theologian says "we can never
know". But that doesn't change the fact that, at present, each answer ends in
the exact same sort of unknowability. You can literally swap "God" and "the
singularity" or "the quantum vacuum" Etc. and change nothing whatsoever. So
those scientists complaining that God isn't an answer, because we immediately
have to ask "whence God", have theories that suffer from the exact same issue.
But they don't see that. The article gave other examples, and maybe you'll like
those better.

But again, I don't think it's saying science knows more than it thinks it does.
It's actually raising a lot more issues about institutional science, what's
coming out of scientists, e.g. the evolutionary psychology "just so" stories,
how some people think science is the hammer for every nail, how some scientists
feel that because they have knowledge in one area they can speak out about ALL
areas, Etc. Let me put it this way. I'm going to the doctor today to see if
there's something wrong with my lungs. Should I ask that doctor to fix my car?
Of course not, because that's not their area of expertese. If I want my car
fixed, I should go to a mechanic. So why should I just blithely accept what a
biologist has to say about ethics? Ethics isn't their area of expertese,
biology is.

"Science is Philosophy 2.0" does not mean that science has all the answers, or
is capable of such. I think it faces the same problems of infinite regression,
obviously. It's just a more refined, informed version of philosophy. Science
offers more resolution to philosophy.

Yes, you can label the infinite regression "God" if you want to. I can also
label is "Foo". Are they exactly the same thing? Or is the term "God" loaded
with other unstated assumptions? I think that's the objection to the term, from
scientists. The word "God" implies other things for most people.

Rather than labeling it God, it's just best to leave it unlabeled, so it
doesn't inherit the qualities of something else via analogy.


Again, I ask - Given different explanations for a phenomenon, how should a
person choose which one to use as their mental model? What is the criteria or
process to decide?


Ethics> I'm not sure ethics are relevant to anything. Philosophy can address it
because I think old school philosophy is flawed by even asking the
question. I choose to un-ask the question of what is ethical, and cast it into
the realm of irrelevant questions, along with "what does Red sound like?"

I know a number of scientists (in the truest sense, like several who work at

its flaws, and that the whole are of "Published Science" is not as pure as what
they practice or what they hope science can be. It's an institution with flaws
that re recognized by those within it.

Luckily, those who speak out about the flaws are not beaten to death or locked

Oh also, Jl, you're the one getting hung up on labels. Because the argument I
hear isn't "well you say God, but then what IS God? Because if God's like a

then it might work ... but if God's ..." I hear, "you can't say 'God' to where
does the universe/life on earth come from, because that's not an answer. I'll
just want to know where God came from, and then where the thing that made God
came from, and where the thing that made that came from, and so on". That exact
same argument owrks for any causal chain. Where did life come from? Oh
chemicals got together ... whence the chemicals? Oh the stars exploded ...
whence the stars? Oh the universe ... Whence the universe? Oh the quantum
vacuum ... Whence the quantum vacuum?

It has nothing to do with "God" being more problematic than "quantum vacuum".
It has to do with the fact that we're dealing with a causal chain. If every
effect needs a cause, then you can pick ANY link in that chain and play a three
year old and keep on asking "why?" But if that example's an issue for you, the

I don't care what you label it - I agree that it's there from the God side and
the Science side (unless you decide there was no start, like a circle).

I object to calling it "God" only because that is a loaded term. And people
often pretend like they are just using "God" as a label for our ignorance, when
in reality a lot of other assumptions are being carried along with it.


> So tell me, why shouldn't I take all your money?

I have no answer to that, because there isn't a "shouldn't". There are just
effects of this action which you will most likely find unpleasant.

To talk about a "shouldn't" requires some context. As in, why shouldn't you
steal my money, in the context of yourself? Or society in general? Or from the
perspective of the financial system?

If you don't provide context, then you must appeal to a higher absolute, which
I don't think exists. I don't think there is fundamental right and wrong, and
more than an ant has right or wrong actions.

I'm not doing your homework for you. You can check out the popular books and
websites of atheists yourself. As for ethics, it's weird that you think a
context negates them. I'm pretty sure not every philosopher who deals with
ethics claims they're some sort of fundamental part of the universe or
something. So fine, let's provide a context. I want your money. There you go.

Now let's start looking at it. I want your money. You don't want me to have it,
because it's yours. But I can take it from you. Then you might say that the
consequences are that you'd take it back and/or defend yourself, possibly
injuring me. I conclude that I'm stronger than you, or maybe I conclude that I
really want your money and no repercussions, so I kill you for it. Your
suggestion leads to the following conclusion:  if I pick a context or contexts,
and decide I can deal with or avoid the potentially unpleasant consequences, I
should decide to take your money.

But see, ethics is just the philosophy of how you treat other people, gods, now
I sound like a damned Objectivist! So even your conclusion, assuming that's
what you were going for, is ethics. So i'm not sure how or why you conclude
that it's meaningless. And I think this is EXACTLY what the article is getting
at, it's outside of the way science deals with things, so who cares? It's
completely meaningless. Oh and, BTW, I'm seriously not trying to be a dick
here, but "what does red sound like?", might be a very meaningful question to
synesthetes, and hence, something science might in fact deal with. Or then
again, we might apply some way of converting red's wavelength range into the
audible range, and there you go. I know they've done that with the sun,
black holes, Etc. I can't swear to this, but I think they're actually doing
something like that with ... I don't remember what, but some set of data,
converting it to sounds, to try to find patterns in it that we might miss. So I
guess that doesn't seem like such a meaningless question either.

I'll read the thread in a minute, but I first wanted to post my reaction to the
article that Gwynn linked to (indirectly).

It's... okay. I couldn't shake the feeling, however, that it tried to prove
that "scientism" was bad by cherry-picking the worst of its fruit rather than
attacking the core. For example, the stuff about epistemology: the author first
spends a very little time on "Einstein's pardox," that is, why the universe is
comprehensible (which would be a very fun discussion) but then turns to those
few people who analogize evolution to the survival of scientific ideals. Sure,
van Fraassen and Quine are wrong on this one, and the author has a point. But
one could write a "scientistic" epistemology that was just as problematic, yet
completely avoid the erroneous metaphor. In other words, the problem with
scientism vis-a-vis epistemology is NOT relying on Darwinism to say that we
should find truth. But that's what the author spends time on, because it's
easier.

Same with ethics. The real problem with scientism and ethics is that the
absolutist naturalists turn to moral relativism and insist that philosophy, for
its lack of ability to derive an ought from an is, is EQUALLY empty as science
when it comes to ethics. There's an interesting argument to be had there. But
instead he takes on one guy, Sam Harris, who is really very bad at recognizing
where he's engaging in solid philsophy. Again, the author doesn't get to the
core of the problem, but plays around the outside.

The section on metaphysics is better. No complaints there.

But the stuff in the beginning, on falsifiability versus institutional science,
is more of the same. He sets up institutional science as pretty much a straw
man, claiming that the scientistic view is that because science is an
institution, it inevitably goes towards truth. After doing so, it's easy enough
to trash down. He misses two key premises of the scientistic worldview, though:

1) All true statements are in principle falsifiable;
2) Institutional science is more likely to lead to truth than other forms of
learning PROVIDED that it's infused with the belief in the scientific method.

These are both debatable, of course, but again the author doesn't debate
them--he just complains about people forgetting that philosophy helped develop
the scientific method (which doesn't mean it has continued efficacy) and then
attacking his straw man.

So, while I've argued in here before that I don't really believe science has
all the answers, I think this guy does a fairly poor job of it.

I'd agree, but I think that's because he was trying to cram too much into an
essay. He seems to want to have a discussion about the history of scientism and
bring up examples as well, and I think it made him a bit slipshod at both. I
mean, I agree with what he's saying, more or less, but I think he could have
picked better examples. I also think he's too stuck in his own head. He thinks
this stuff is obvious, which is why I think he glosses over the discussion of
the Einstein paradox, for instance. He assumes everybody knows it and will come
to the same conclusion he does.

I still think the article's decent, but I guess I should have said more about
where I disagreed with it, and also that I posted it here because it seemed to
directly follow on from discussions we were having here, in Spiritual, and
maybe in Atheism. As an example, I thought his discussion of "just so stories"
in evolutionary psychology was true, if limited, and that, for me, directly
ties into Jl's attacks on story as a poor man's method of understanding. But
rather than completely agree with the author, though I do agree they're not
necessarily science, or rather that they don't tell us much, I think it also
highlights the point I and several others made, you can't NOT tell stories,
it's how we work.

However, saying something like "evolutionarily men were programmed to screw
multiple partners to spread those genes baby!" doesn't tell us much, and I
agree with the author. It's weird that they trot these stories out as "how we
are" but then castigate that behavior. Because it seems obvious, Esp. from
those who hold to scientism, that science is telling us how to act, except in
these cases where it can't because the people know they'd be breaking lots of
societal norms.

Anyway, I should have been a bit more clear about all of that stuff, those
connections and such.

Huh? I said there are no ethics without context. In order to have a "should",
you have to have a goal. The action you "should" take is the one that best
achieves the goal. So, pick a goal, and try to figure out what you "should"
do. If you are starving and your kids will die soon, and my money will save
their lives, then you "should" steal my money. If you're greedy and I have a
gun, then you "should not" steal my money.

There is no "should" outside of a goal, or context. There is no absolute right
or wrong, in any sense. IMO.

That's why I think ethics is kind of irrelevant, because it just becomes a
matter of finding the most beneficial path to follow, which is a scientific
question. Or can be. And I do believe that ethics boils down to that.


I would still be interested in your answer to my root question:

I don't understand. Certainly you decide between alternate explanations all the
time. It's not theory - you actually do it. I'm asking you to introspect, and
figure out what means you use to choose, assuming you believe that you choose.

Make it easy: Newtonian physics and Relativity are both models for explaining
what we see around us. Do you think they are equally true?

or: Modern medicine recognizes germs, but other explanations propose that there
are little demons and spirits which are affecting a person's health. Do you
accept both explanations without a preference for one over the other?

My point is that different explanations have different degrees of value, even

Personally, given that it's almost impossible to write laws and advocate for
social action if we truly believe in determinism, I think it's necessary to
provisionally believe in free will for those purposes. Therefore, ethical
philosophy is a must.

Of course, free will doesn't necessarily get you over the is-ought distinction

Indeed, though free will is an illusion of sorts, we are still part of the
illusion, so we act as if we are determining our own destiny.

I'm not sure what kind of ethics evolves out of this worldview, to be honest. I
think ethics are a necessary part of a civil society, but they are probably the
result, rather than the cause. That is, ethics are not prescriptions for how to
act, but descriptions of how we do act, in general.

It might all boil down to utilitarianism in the end, I guess. Even if you act
out of selfish desire, that's still utilitarian because society needs that and
can only move forward as a whole if people practice selfish behavior.

I've always been at a loss to find any "black and white" ethical statements
which I agree with. It's all shades of gray, and depends on the situation. So
when we look for what ethics people "should" follow, I just don't really know
how to answer that question. I can talk about laws and rules and punishment and
all that, but none of it stems from "right" or "wrong".

humans, any more than I could address the ethics of ants. Or dogs. Or
chimpanzees. Etc.

But I admit, I'm not fully comfortable with this, because I *do* have a sense
of free will, and I *do* think there are some ways that people should and
should not act (generally speaking). I just don't think those opinions are

mechanical brain. Saving somebody's life is just the output of my mechanical
brain. Rape is just the output of my mechanical brain. And so on.

See, on the one hand, responding to my question, you say that's exactly what
you mean, ethics has to have some context to act in. But now again, you're
talking about it like ethics == universally right or wrong, sans context. Which
is it? Similarly, I don't think we have to comment on ALL of human ethics to
have a valid ethics.

Let's put it this way. Suppose we got to the point where we never murdered
another human being, because we decided murder was wrong, and more
specifically, murdering another human being was wrong. Suddenly, and all of a
sudden, we're invaded by aliens bent on killing every last one of us. If we
decide that we need to kill the aliens because nothing else is working, not
even lesser violence as a method of driving them off, does that suddenly make
our ethics about killing invalid? I'd say no, even leaving out the human
species part. Because we're living in a different context now. Others might
argue that we should indeed allow ourselves to get killed, and that's the only
way to uphold our ethics.

As for your question about how I decide between alternatives, in case you
haven't figured it out, I'm tossing your own answer right back at you. You gave
no context, and I don't think there's a universal way to figure out which
alternative is "better", or that it's even the case that one alternative is
always somehow "better" than another. What does "better" mean anyway, BTW? And
I also see you're making it easy on yourself. Ooo .. your kid has cancer, you
gonna go with germs or little demon creatures, huh buddy? Which one's gonna
help your kid?

That's nice, but let's take it a step further. You're assuming that I'm picking
between treatment alternatives, and hence, modern medicine's view will always
win, since we can show it to be more effective. Suppose I think it shouldn't be
"treated" at all? Suppose my alternative is, this is how the universe works? If
an animal or plant gets sick, it either fights off the sickness or dies.
Suppose I view humans the exact same way, and just let my putative kid's cancer
run its course? Now what? How do I decide between treatment and not treatment?

But fine, let's get back to your version. Germs or demons, never mind that
cancer isn't caused by germs, and germs really are a lot like the demons, e.g.
they both invade the body and so on. So you want to say, well clearly one's
better than the other, you cast out the demons and it ain't gonna do shit, that
kid needs some radiation or chemo or something! Yeah. Except in a lot of
traditional cultures, Esp. when they come here, there's both. There's no
decision to be made, because they do their own rituals and such, and go to the
doctor too. I suppose the best-known example of this is "The Spirit Catches You
And You Fall Down", if you haven't read it yet I highly recommend it, it's an
excellent, if depressing, book.

So I mean, for me the question doesn't make a lot of sense, as you've framed
it. Because I'm looking at real world examples of this supposed conflict you're
bringing up, something where I'm presumably forced to make a decision, and it's
just not happening. Well let me be clear. I know it happens. There are
Christian Scientists who refuse all medical treatment, Evangelicals who choose
exorcism over modern medicine, Etc. I'm not trying to ignore those things or
claim they don't occur. What I am saying is that, in the majority of cases I've
heard about, this sort of crisis point that forces a decision between one
paradigm and another, as though they're mutually exclusive, totally opposite,
and never the twain shall meet, just doesn't seem to be necessary.

But hey, maybe this is too peopley and stuff. Let's go back to some nice HARD
data stuff. You mentioned Newtonian and Einsteinian physics. How do I choose
between them? Again, do I? I'm pretty sure Newtonian physics is still taught in
most high schools, and in fact, for many of the contexts most of us are likely
to care about, it's also perfectly applicable. Similarly, the solar system
model of the atom, while wrong in some ways, does give you a decent beginning
understanding of things like chemical bonds. If you want a really good example
of something along these lines, I can't think of a better one than Euclidean
geometry. Wrong in many ways, hell it's even dealing with ideal objects!, but I
can still use it to do quite a hell of a lot of stuff. Which is why we haven't

That's the root of the question.

Your answer seems to be "it depends". Obviously. But depends on what? Every
situation will be slightly different, with different options and factors. But
in the end, how do you reach a conclusion?

I know that newtonian physics and relativity are both still used in different
cases. Then in this case, perhaps the answer is one of utility - which theory
proves to be most accurate, or whatever.

I'm not understanding your analogy, JL. In physics, the best theory is the one
that does the best job of modeling the data. It's descriptive. In ethics, the
theories are not intended to model the data of human judgements and behavior;
that's another discipline -- sociology or anthropology perhaps. An system of
ethics is intended to inform and guide human judgements and behavior, which is
prescriptive not descriptive.

"Stepp> I'd like to know your take on ethics, from someone with a determinist
leaning."

It's sort of complex, and probably inconsistent, but what the hey. :)

First, as I stated before, for the purposes of determining ethical and
political behavior, that I provisionally believe in free will and that we're
capable of moral decisions. I can do so because there is by definition no harm
that can come from being wrong about this! It's like a smarter version of
Pascal's Wager; smarter because I'm not required to believe with all my heart
and because I don't have numerous religions from which to choose. As an aside,
I think I'm going to invent a religion where only people who don't believe it
go to Heaven, in order to torpedo the Wager.

I'm still an atheist, though, and basically a materialist. Moreover, I've never
really been convinced by any of the deontological theories of morality that
don't include God. For me, they really don't get over the is-ought bump. So on
a purely rational level, I'm still a little bit of a moral relativist.

But I still have my values, and I think it would be a mistake to completely
ignore their existence. I don't care that morality is technically relative; I
don't think that religious nutjobs should stone adulterers in the public
square. And so I need to square that moral instinct with this idea of
relativism.

For me, that's a two-step process. One is recognizing that in a number of ways
people are very similar. We prefer pleasure over pain. We want to be treated
fairly. We don't like to be told to do things we don't want to do. These moral
instincts are sufficiently similar that we can communicate about moral
behavior. Because of those similarities, morality isn't radically relative:
since most of us agree about some core premises, we can start to discuss which
rules best achieve those core premises.

HOWEVER, and this is no doubt because of my own native values in part, the
lack of an external moral arbiter means that it doesn't make sense to inflict
your moral beliefs on another. That is, only people who consent to a certain
kind of morality should be subject to it, and people should not be punished for
actions that do not harm others. (Harming someone without their consent is
equivalent to inflicting your moral code upon them.) So I prefer a moral code
that maximizes freedom.

What about utilitarianism? After all, I suggested that we're all universal and
prefer pleasure; why shouldn't I look to maximize overall happiness rather than
caring about the individual? My reason for that is best summed up by Ursula K.
LeGuin's story "Those Who Walk Away From Omelas," which is fantastic and brief
and well worth reading. Even if you don't like stories, JL, think of it as an
illustration. :) In short, though, I don't think a society can exist that seeks
to maximize happiness while failing to believe that the individual human is
special and beautiful and uniquely valuable--in short, that it has a certain
right to be treated well, and when a society does not do so it is the worse for
it.

So in a way this is a form of utilitarianism, but one that practically denies
itself, because human nature is such that pure utilitarianism would not work.

I can relate to the struggle between the values you believe you hold, and the
implications that your philosophy seems to have. I seem to part ways with your
thinking somewhere around here:

> I don't care that morality is technically relative

You seem to want to hold on to your views of right and wrong, despite the fact
that your worldview points to there being no right and wrong.

> Because of those similarities, morality isn't radically relative

For the most part, true. But perhaps more radically relative the more of the
world you include. I think that the accepted behavior of some people in the
middle east sure seems radically relative to me.

>the lack of an external moral arbiter means that it doesn't make
>sense to inflict your moral beliefs on another

But... why? That seems like an arbitrary conclusion. What if I believe that it
*is* okay to inflict moral beliefs on someone else? Then you telling me not to
do so *is* inflicting your beliefs on me.

Personally, I don't see a problem with inflicting moral beliefs on others. I
think that's just how it works, and the end result is an evening out of the
moral code. It's like saying the molecules in air have no right to inflict
their energy on others. But they do. And that's how temperature works. We see
no reason to place judgement on that, just as I would assume a higher life form
would think it ridiculous to place judgement on our behavior. There is no right
or wrong, there is just behavior.

When it comes to ethics and morals, I think of this... a rock rolling down a
hill does not think about whether it is rolling in the right direction. It
rolls how it must roll, and continues to do so until stopped. I am configured
to have certain beliefs about what is right and wrong, and I shouldn't question
whether I am justified in having these beliefs. I have them, and I should
continue in that direction until someone else or another belief stops me. It
just is. There is no "why".

> human nature is such that pure utilitarianism would not work

I might argue the opposite. Pure utilitarianism *is* what works, because is the
means by which the higher order can "think" for itself. If that means anything.

Utilitarianism is in the best interest of life itself, which isn't concerned
about individuals. But individuals concerned about themselves is the means by
which it is accomplished.

I look out for my body as a whole, without regards to individual organisms or
cells within it. Yet they are all doing the job of keeping my body going, and I
could not continue going without their work, and their sacrifice. etc.

"I might argue the opposite. Pure utilitarianism *is* what works, because is

I'm offering an empirical proposition here, not an abstract ones. Societies
that treat humans as only part of a greater whole turn out to be _less_
life-affirming than those who treat the individual as uniquely valuable. This
is due to the vagaries of human nature, I suspect, but the point remains: even
if your overall value structure is utilitarian, if we actually accepted that as
an ideal moral system it would be less good for life overall.

Okay, I'll make a leap - I believe that all moral codes are selfish.
Utilitarianism included. The only reason we believe in the "greater good" is
because we think (perhaps subconsciously) that it creates a society that
betters our chances of survival.

We don't and probably can't form moral belief systems around things that do not
involve us in any way. You could not tell me whether it is right or wrong for a
member of the Vythnu tribe in northern africa to wash a goat in the river. You
would need some context - some way to relate it back to yourself to make any
decision. And the decision you reach would be based on beliefs you've formed
from your own life, which have evolved from your desire to stay alive.

Pure altruism doesn't exist.

As a parent, I would sacrifice my life for my child. But even that is selfish,
because I want my child to live. It always comes back to self.

So in the end, I do believe that we can have moral codes and beliefs about
ethics. But I think it's absurd to think that we're actually coming up with
some objective view of right and wrong, or that we could even devise an ethical
system that doesn't depend on our own self-centered view of the world.

That's the kind of stuff that religion tries to inject, and I reject it
completely. We should recognize that we are all selfish beings (as any form of
Life is), that our moral codes emerge from that, and that our collective moral
code of everyone combined is what forms the best way for society in general to
survive.

In short, we shouldn't get all high and mighty about our own beliefs. But that
doesn't mean we should stop fighting for them.

Now, is there reasoning involved? Sure. If I'm composing music and I'm looking

you're with someone because the two of you are compatible, i.e. share enough

consider that the totality of the thing. And even though you're using reason, I
don't think your modeling any data, no. I'm sorry, I know this really seems to

shouldn't get evaluated like a scientific theory. And that's fine, we don't do

That's not quite right. I recognize I can't help but hold on to my views of
right and wrong, even though I suspect they can't be proven. They are a
fundamental part of my identity. They are who I am. To try to deny them in the
name of rationality would be to deny myself entirely. I am large. I contain

You've gotten out of the free will paradigm again, though. If you accept the
free-will premise, even provisionally, then things like "rights" start to make
some form of sense.

That said, you're partially right--I'm not sure this arises directly out of the
lack of a moral arbiter, and I didn't justify it properly. That's a result of
this all being muddled in my own mind to some extent.

Where I should have put it is after the understanding that people are uniquely
valuable and important. That is, if the best path to maximizing happiness is
the power of the individual, then you need a really good reason before you go
infringing on the rights of the individual--your moral code has to be actively
benefiting other people. In libertarian philosophy you might see this called
the model of "self-ownership."

What's more, I think this understanding caters to the feelings that most
everyone has--that it's better to feel good than to be bad, and that you
shouldn't do something to someone else that you wouldn't want done to yourself
(unless they want you to). Speaking broadly, those ARE universal--it's just the
specifics where things start to seem more radically relative than they in fact
are.

"Okay, I'll make a leap - I believe that all moral codes are selfish.
Utilitarianism included. The only reason we believe in the "greater good" is
because we think (perhaps subconsciously) that it creates a society that
betters our chances of survival."

I'm sorry, but I think this is entirely wrong. Even from a deterministic
standpoint, because you're creating this subconscious thought process that
probably isn't there. When we believe in the greater good, we really believe in
it wholeheartedly. It just so happens that given our nature belief in the
greater good is valuable to society.

"Pure altruism doesn't exist.

As a parent, I would sacrifice my life for my child. But even that is selfish,
because I want my child to live. It always comes back to self."

This is a poor definition of altruism. Altruism is not doing things for others
because they make you miserable. It's doing things for others without expecting
any return beyond pleasure in helping others. In other words, what you're
defining as altrusim isn't very interesting, I think.

"So in the end, I do believe that we can have moral codes and beliefs about
ethics. But I think it's absurd to think that we're actually coming up with
some objective view of right and wrong, or that we could even devise an ethical
system that doesn't depend on our own self-centered view of the world."

This I agree with, but I don't think it follows from your point about
selfishness. If you were interested in political philosophy enough to read
about it, I'd suggest John Rawls at this point, as I have before; he
anticipates your concerns about objectivity and hypothesizes what the ideal
society would be if we could all step back and think objectively about it--or,
more accurately, he asks us to hypothesize that such a society is possible. He
then suggests that what we should try to do is not create that society, but to
try to put into places the processes that would allow us to figure out what it
is. It's a nice piece of work.

When you think about it that way, you _can_ say there's an objective right and
wrong, as long as it follows objectively from our premises. And if our premises
are that all humans want to be happy and to be treated fairly, and there exists
a society that can achieve that, then you can treat things that move us towards
that society as "right" and things that move us away as "wrong."

"In short, we shouldn't get all high and mighty about our own beliefs. But that
doesn't mean we should stop fighting for them."

I don't think you've ever justified very well why _you_ believe you should
fight for them.

There's that, too. I mean, sure, if what Jl's saying is "don't you pick
something that fits with your experience of the world", then sure. But I don't
think Jl wants to say that, because then I just go "animism fits with my
experience of the world", and clearly Jl doesn't think I should be an animist,
or let's say, in an ideal world, I shouldn't be. I'm not suggesting he has some
sort of active problem with the fact that I'm an animist. But he does think
there's a better set of things I could be thinking, and said set lacks animism,
I'm guessing.

So I come right back to my question. Sex is a type of human behavior. When I
have sex, what data am I best modeling? That question appears completely
nonsensical to me. Or if you'd like a different topic, I'm learning banjo right
now. What data am I best modeling when I learn banjo? If Jl's argument is, well
you're modeling that you want to learn music as opposed to running a marathon,
that's trivially true, but I don't see why it's supposed to be at all
interesting.

Actually, speaking of music, Jl reminds me of some people. There are people who
think "music theory" means something like "scientific theory", i.e. Western
music theory has worked out the nice, usable harmonies Etc., and here's how you
write about music, and notate it, and so on. So they take the theory as a set
of rules, here are the allowable things we can do to write something called "a
musical composition". They have fits when you throw music from other cultures
at them. You start hearing things about it being "wrong" or "unsophisticated"
or using "bad harmonies" and so on. Hell one person tried to tell me that
Western Europe invented polyphony. I laughed at him and told him to go listen
to some Pygmy music and get back to me.

Now I know, because I listen to lots of folk music from all over the place and
also because I understand the history of music, that this whole process goes
the other way. Somebody, or some group of people/culture/Etc., comes up with
something musically interesting. We then go, "wow that was neat, how do we
write/talk about that"? In other words, the music comes first, then the
"theory" follows. Similarly, no I don't think "the best thing that models the
data" should be applied to things like human behavior. Why? Same reason, the
behavior comes first, the data collected from it and the models produced from
that data are secondary, at best.

As for "mystic beliefs", sure I guess, but I'm with Pecc. I don't think
"hallucination" or "brain malfunction" or "misapplied pattern recognition" and
so on are more accurate models of my experiences than my experiences
themselves. But again, I think this question is really more interesting than
afight, which thing do you choose? There can be only ONE! Suppose, for
instance, that I do a divination. I say, "the runes showed me ..." or maybe
"the gods told me through the runes ..." or "the spirits used the kazhyk to
tell me that ..."

You say, "no no no, see you're just interpreting meaning out of a pattern, and
really anything would do, it doesn't have to be runes or kazhyk, it could be
tarot cards or shells or tea leaves or any old stones". I say, "fine, I
absolutely agree with you. I'm interpreting meaning out of a pattern, and yes,
it could be done with any of those things". See, the real point of divination
isn't that you get a pattern unique to every situation, that would impossible
with any divination system I've ever heard of, and certainly ones like kazhyk,
which are limited to about 16 or so, I forget. Hell some systems are yes/no.

The point is that I get a pattern that has a baring on the question being
asked, by me or by somebody else. Jl would probably say that science can't test
that, and that would sort of be my point in all of this. But also, the two
interpretations don't have to be mutually exclusive. I might be great at runes
but horrible at tarot, for instance. So what? Well everything's through me.
Whether you want to say it's JUST me and the patterns, or the gods and spirits
and me, it doesn't matter. I'm still the one dealing with whatever comes up. So
tarot might be great for Pecc, but not so good for me, since I can't see the
pictures. But I mean, I absolutely agree with you, it's me and my relationship
to those patterns that we're talking about here. I just think there's more
there, that's all. But I don't have a problem with the claim that I'm getting
meaning out of patterns, because that's exactly what's happening.

What I say is that your beliefs and observations should be internally

need to resolve that. And then, how do you pick which model/theory to
"believe"?

You can say you believe in multiple gods, fine. That's an analogy of the world
that helps you comprehend it, and I have no real opinion on that. I think of
the universe in analogies that are familiar to me.

What I have an opinion on is when beliefs contradict with other accepted
beliefs, and there is no desire to resolve that.

Contradictions are a sign of a bad theory/model.

When I ask "how do you choose a theory" what I'm really asking is "how do you
resolve the conflict?"


Of course, some people don't see the conflict. In fact, this is pretty typical.
But that's often cured by education. Yeah, you can say it's insulting to claim
that ignorance leads to mystical beliefs. But in many cases, it's true. You
can't continue to believe in a worldwide flood after you have basic information
about science. You just can't accept both.

The same applies to many other belief systems.

When people have belief systems that don't match mine, but they remain
internally consistent, and match observation just as well as mine, I consider
them to be both equally viable, and I have no problem with it. At least until
more data is available, and we can perhaps see which belief is better.

pick whichever model I am most comfortable with, then I could go down that
rabbit hole and talk about why I don't think you really believe that. That is,
provide additional evidence to contradict that belief, which should cause you
to drop it.

>Why should I care whether you personally believe in Newtonian dynamics or not?

Because it's a simple instance of the bigger question. It helps you figure
out how to evaluate different models that contradict each other. It helps you
have a discussion with someone about why they should believe one thing and not
another.

If no one cares what anyone else believes, and everyone is free to have any
contradicting non-sensical irrational belief systems they want, then we're in a
free-for-all, and there's nothing to discuss, because anything goes.

There are, of course, different domains of knowledge.  When speaking of the
physical world and physical phenomena, the scientific method works better than
anything else we've currently got as a system of organizing and testing
knowledge.  By the standards of the scientific method, no, you should not
accept Newtonian physics -- not without realizing that it's an incomplete
description of the universe and we've got a better model (actually, two models
-- one for the very large, and one for the very small).

I contend that religious experience and our inner lives are largely a different
magisterium which does not overlap well with the scientific method.  Certain
statistical methods can allow us to apply some parts of the scientific method
to inner experience, but imperfectly.  We need other methods for those
domains of knowledge, jut as we don't use the scientific method to study art,
literature, or music.

Proposal: In the real world (i.e. not deductive logic), contradictions do not
exist. There always exists a theory under which both data can be explained.

Thus, the only way to choose one is to decide which is more likely. Since
weighing the two is necessarily based on gut feeling rather than something
provable and rational, all decision-making about the real world is necessarily
irrational.

Oh, but we do. Science can now predict which faces are more attractive, which
books are well written, and which movies will be liked the most. It can write
original music which musicians have a hard time distinguishing from music
written by humans.

Since I'm a bit of a materialist, I of course contend that those things which
you might consider to be subjective and based on experience are actually
physical phenomenon, created and governed entirely by physical processes.

Hell, even the things we *experience* and *think* are coming under the umbrella
of science. We can detect thoughts about subject matters, induce experiences,
etc with an increasing amount of control and accuracy. I see no reason not to
believe that we will be able to induce very realistic experiences in the near
future, or to know parts of what a person is thinking purely by analyzing their
brains.

When behavior becomes predictable to a high degree of accuracy, I think that's
pretty good evidence that the process behind it is mathematical in nature, and
governed by physical laws.

Of course, you can use an alternate explanation using gods, spirits, etc. That
works great as an analogy, and may be an easier "shortcut" to some universal
truths. But it does not work NEARLY as well in predicting anything.

Which brings me back to the question about how to choose a belief system. If
one system makes predictions that match up with observations much better than
the other, then that is a good reason to choose the more predictable theory.

Religion and spirituality is pretty bad in the prediction department. We have
all these stories about how humans behave, morality, good and evil, etc. But
since when can any of that tell us about what might happen next? Not often!

Whereas science is becoming much better at predicting human behavior - not as
much on the individual level but as a group. Just look at marketing departments
of big companies - they have an insane amount of information and can predict
consumer behaviors in crazy accurate ways. Not perfect, no. But the science is
evolving. We are not as 'free thinking' as we think we are.

So anyway... this is why I continue to value the scientific model, even in
human behavior, experiences, and thoughts. It's a better description of the
world, makes better predictions, and has a higher degree of accuracy than other
ways of viewing the world.

That's not to say the other systems have no value. They do. Just as newtonian
physics does. We just have to recognize that they are a "coarser" view of
reality, and their utility diminishes and we get more data and look closer.

FWIW, I've been thinking about how I go about evaluating different models or
belief systems and choosing one. I think I use the following criteria, in
descending order of importance:

1. Internally consistent with itself
2. Consistent with observation
3. Predictive ability/accuracy
4. Ability to explain past events
5. How it makes me feel

It seems that there are a lot of people that skip the first 4, and only choose
belief systems based on #5. I'm not really sure how to argue against that,
because if they have no desire for consistency and explanatory power, then how
could I ever argue that there are better options?

But, I believe that evolution and progress is favoring a more analytical
model. New advances depend on #1-4, while someone who favors only #5 will not
make many of the advances that our society has made. I think it's obvious that
sticking to only #5 may help some people survive, it's not the optimal choice
for life as a whole.

Where I see a conflict between science and other belief systems is when I see
that science is much better at some of the higher-priority criteria, and
therefore I am compelled to adopt it.

When science is no better at meeting the criteria than a belief in mysticism or
whatever, then I don't really state a preference about it.

For example, what caused the big bang? God, or a previous universe? I don't
really care, because neither explanation meets any of criteria #1-#4. So I
go to #5, and I don't fault anyone for picking either one based on how it makes
them feel.

HOWEVER... if that conclusion then leads them to OTHER beliefs, which do NOT
stand up as well against science or other explanations, then that is where I
have issues with THOSE beliefs.

Step:

I guess I question the idea that you and Pecc have had the same sorts of
experiences. Here's an admittedly crude analogy. Suppose I told you kings were
awesome, and you said, no, they're just people. Then you said you knew that
because we'd had roughly the same kinds of experiences, i.e. we've all talked
to people. Except I've talked to a king, and you haven't. Of course that
doesn't mean my asessment of kings is automatically correct, if I've only
talked to one king I'm generalizing for one thing, but you get the basic idea
here. I think it's easy to get caught up in the idea of similar experiences and
use that to analyze whatever in terms we think we understand.

And then again, what you brought up has to be taken into account too, I guess
I'd call it temperment. For instance, I've seen people meet famous people, well
famous in context, and just get all gushy and whatever. I don't really do that.
I mean, OK, it's cool to meet people, don't get me wrong. But where J. Random
Huun-Huur-Tu fan is going "OMG you guys are awesome OMG OMG OMG!", I'm going
"you guys are awesome, hey you don't happen to have five minutes to show me
something on this instrument do you"? Because for me their awesomeness doesn't
come from them as such, not that they're not great people I'm sure. It's that
they do really awesome music, which sure is out fo who they are as people, but
I want to find out more about that, since I do it myself.

I guess my point is, part of this has to be what kind of significance you bring
to what sorts of experiences. As Pecc's pointed out, since you're a
materialist, you'll likely write off any experience Pecc has to some sort of
abnormal brain state or misapprehension of the world, that sort of thing. A
question I've always thought was interesting is, assume for the sake of
argument that gods and ghosts and whatever else exist, except for cryptids
because they're just weird animal things running around. I mean all the
traditional, nonmaterial, supernatural stuff. How would science/materialism
even figure that out? I mean, it's predicated on the idea that these things
don't exist. What would it take to break that assumption?

Let's put it another way. Suppose you volunteered for Pecc's experiment.
Suppose I also volunteered. We did what Pecc said, and we both got the same
sorts of results. Now I'd say something like, "well, Pecc said do X Y and Z and
A B and C will happen, and A B and C did in fact happen. So that leads me to
conclude that I can at least provisionally believe in D E and F". You'd likely
say "Pecc said if I do X Y and Z, A B and C would happen, and A B and C did in
fact happen. All this proves is that if I do X Y and Z, A B and C will happen,
it says nothing about D E and F". Assume D E and F to be gods/spirits, some
cosmological explanation of the universe, whatever you like. Others might even
say that X Y and Z didn't produce A B and C at all, something else did, say,
some sort of psychological mechanism like investment.

Explanations like that have always struck me as odd. Basically, if you don't
know, it goes like this. Suppose somebody told me the mac was an awesomely
accessible computer for the blind, way better than windows. But they don't want
me to take their word for it, they're going to give me one for a month and let
me try it. For a month I'll just use a mac, no other machine. So I do it. And
at the end of the month, I'm going "man, hell yeah, I need to get me a mac,
they're way more accessible, this is awesome"! Psychological investment says,
nope, you're wrong, they're not more accessible at all, I'm just bullshitting
myself because I just invested a month in this thing, and I don't want to get
to the end of that month and go "wow, that was a complete waste of time".
That's pretty much why some people say experience isn't proof of whatever, e.g.
somebody asked you to meditate ten minutes for a day for a month and said you'd
be less stressed/happier, you did it, and you in fact claim to be less
stressed/happier.

Nope, that's all bullshit, because if you actually committed to doing it,
you're invested, so we can't trust a damn thing you have to say on the subject.
But that seems really peculiar to me. I'm not saying it doesn't exist, mind
you. I just question the idea that we automatically throw out my own statements
about my own experiences because some third party has decided I'm probably
tricking myself. Well how do we know that's not happening everywhere? It sure
would suck if you invested all these years into scientific materialism and
found out it was totally wrong, wouldn't it? I mean, if we're going to use this
to question experiences, let's not be selective here. Let's go all out, if
we're gonna go for it.

Why do you think that? I don't think so at all. I think that ghosts/spirits/etc
could certainly fall within the realm of science. There are interesting ideas
about how it could all fit together. The problem is, there's just no compelling
reason to believe it is so. It's an arbitrary model with no real basis. If X
happens, you call it a ghost, I call it an invisible pink unicorn. Neither of
us have any justification to our belief. That's why these mystical explanations
of things are not very useful. They may help you model the world, but they
don't empower you to make any predictions, nor can you really come with a
consistent theory of all the observations we see.

It's _just_not_good_enough_. No more than a child comes up with a simple
explanation of something they see, like being convinced by Santa Claus. Just
because a child "experiences" seeing Santa Claus fly through the sky, and they
are thoroughly convinced by it, does that mean you believe that Santa is real
for them? (Sorry if I just ruined anything for you).

Seriously, though, that's a real question. On what basis can you decide to
dismiss a child's experience of Santa as being not "real", but don't hold your
own beliefs to the same kind of critical thought?

Or I guess if you want to say that because a child experiences Santa, that
Santa does in fact exist *for them*, then I guess you could do that. But again,
that would be a weird and pretty useless model of the world, IMO. Not much can
come of that kind of thinking.

I don't think Pecc and I deny that this could be the case, but that we're both
wondering if it's NECESSARILY the case. Might it be that we're sufficiently
similar people that we'd bring the same significance to one another's
experiences? I think that's at least possible.

On another note:
" A

I've always agreed with this sentiment. In fact, I put it in a fairly solid
proof. In order for science to recognize a phenomenon, it has to be predictable
and repeatable. So, insofar as nonmaterial stuff is predictable, science will
be able to handle it--because we only recognize it by its effects on material
objects. But if a phenomenon is fundamentally unpredictable--not just in a QM
sense but actually perverse--then science would simply not be able to recognize
that the phenomenon exists. (Free will would be the archetypal example of such
a phenomenon.)

once again, I'll point out the obvious for you. The difference between Santa

you're fifty now, and you still believe. I can start pointing out things like
how each store Santa is different. I can show you parents shopping, wrapping

predictions and ... means that you're striking just as big a blow against all
that stuff as the different store santas and seeing your parents wrapping your
presents strikes against Santa. But you're not. And here's why.

With Santa, you're seeing the mechanism behind it. You're going, "oh I used to
think this, but now I have this and that and the other thing right before my
eyes. So you can see what's going on, as opposed to what you were told was
going on. Now, with spiritual experience, I know you WANT to say, that was a
hallucination, or a psychological defense mechanism, or whatever explanation
you'd like to pull out, and I know you THINK you're doing the same thing,
you're showing me what's REALLY going on. But you're not. That's your guess.
That's your interpretation of what's going on. If you had incontrovertible

Or, my parents wrap gifts? Sure, when Santa can't do it. That doesn't prove
that Santa doesn't exist, just that my parents help him.

Oh, each store Santa is different? Well, obviously there are things about Santa
that we don't understand. Perhaps there isn't just one Santa, but there are
multiple versions of Santa, which are all part of the same Santa. How could we
humans begin to understand the real Santa? Obviously all we can do is
experience Santa in many forms, and hope to infer what the meta-Santa is like.

existence of ghosts or gods. I can only disprove specific predictions or claims

In the same way tht I cannot PROVE that Santa does not exist. But the evidence

It kind of is. When a model is excessively complex, usually there is a simpler
explanation living under it. Countless examples abound. Consider the model for
predicting the motion of the planets, with the earth at the center. It worked
fairly well. But the model with the sun at the center is way simpler and
performs as well or better.

Which is "correct"? Well, neither one. The sun and planets don't check some
formula to decide where to move next. Both these models are _our_ explanation
of it, so we can use them to predict future observations, and see how accurate
our model is. We just prefer the more accurate, simpler model. It seems better.

Fine. I disagree. I think that when you come up with an explanation for
something, you are creating a model of it, whether you intentionally do so or
not.

Otherwise, what exactly are you doing?

You touch a tree. Something happens.

You say "I had an experience with the life force of the tree" or whatever.
I say "The spirit of the pink unicorn entered your veins"
Someone else says "tiny particles of joy were transferred through the
membranes of your skin directly from the planet Saturn."

Okaaaaaaay. So where are we? Nowhere. None of those explanations gave us
anything at all. They are all just labels for something that happened. How
could you possibly say that one explanation is more valuable than the others?
Or that one is right and one is wrong? Or that you find one to be more
acceptable than the others?

The point is YOU ARE DECIDING ON A THEORY! Otherwise, why wouldn't you accept a
deterministic, materialist, scientific worldview instead of the one you have?
Because you ARE applying some rules to the different explanations, and
selecting one, are you not? What I'm asking is to introspect, and figure out
how you arrive at your conclusions. And then you can look at that and see if
there are ways to improve it.


It seems to me that what you're arguing for is no ranking of theories at all,
no need for any explanation to be superior to any other. So what you're left
with are a million different descriptions of the world around us, all equally
valid. Even the theories that we dismissed thousands of years ago because we
gathered more data that conflicted with those beliefs.


I'm not sure that I have much more to say on it. To me, some of this is just so
self-evident and obvious that it's not even worth explaining it to someone who
doesn't have the same context as I do on these things. It's like discussing
math with someone who dismisses the idea of numbers. There isn't much left. If
you don't agree with some core ideas, then our brains are in different worlds,
and I really cannot grasp yours.

But then, I think most people in the world exist in some state of cognitive
dissonance that they either accept or are unaware of. I fight against that, and
that seems to be the exception rather than the rule.

You are a brave brave man, Jl. Yes, it's clearly that the work of fighting
against my own cognitive dissonance is just too damn hard, and next week you'll
post a detailed explanation of how the smurfs rule everything, and I'll accept
it, because hey why not? But really, I've been over ALL of this before. But for
the hell of it, here it is again.

We both accept that the tree is alive. Now, what do we know of other things
that are alive? Well humans have consciousness. We're pretty much finding out
that animals have consciousness too, different from ours but still. So why
shouldn't the tree? You may or may not accept that, but accept, for the sake of
argument, that the tree has some sort of consciusness, by virtue of being a
living organism. OK, so now what? Well, I say the tree communicated with me in
some manner. You say pink unicorns, or joy robots from Saturn, or whatever the
hell thing you're coming up with.

Now, what's the difference between those two? The difference is I just gave you
a causal chain as to how the tree could have communicated with me, and you're
just making shit up to make my experience seem ridiculous. In other words, ONE
of us is arguing in good faith here, and one of us isn't. Let's go back to your
original question. How do I decide communicating tree is better than your
theory where that doesn't happen? Again, you've yet to define "better", I
responded to the examples you gave and you didn't really respond to them,
except to insist, even after several of us have told you this isn't the case,
that Newtonian physics is just plain wrong and Einsteinian physics is clearly
"better", again without explaining what that means. You claim to be a
determinist and insist I can't make choices, neither can you or anybody else,
but you then insist I tell you how I make choices. Why? What does it matter?
Your claim is that it's all an illusion anyway. So what does it matter to you
or anybody else what choices I APPEAR to make? I can't help myself anyway,
anymore than you can, according to your view.

Sorry I didn't get back to you. OK, here's my reasoning. I'm not quite sure
what you're getting at, so I'll explain where I'm coming from, and you can
maybe go off that.

So suppose you do Pecc's experiment, and, I dunno, you hear a voice in your
head. Pecc says that's a god, you say it's a hallucination, the subconscious,
that thing we do where we talk to ourselves in our heads, whatever. I'm
guessing you'd then write it off, whatever that voice said probably isn't that
significant, because it was just you, whereas Pecc might pay more attention to
it. That's not to say Pecc would mindlessly obey it, of course, anymore than
he'd mindlessly obey his best friend if his best friend said something like "I
need you to kill Jim for me".

Or let's say I'm doing a divination with runes and I ask about my career,
should I try for a promotion, let's say. Isa comes up, that's easy, it's a
straight vertical line. That's ice, and usually, though not always, means
things are at a standstill, i.e. frozen. Now we both agree that I had a
question, and we both agree that I drew the rune isa. We might even agree that
something like "I'm at a standstill" or maybe "I should wait" are reasonable
interpretations, since ice can indicate something frozen. We could even see te
vertical line as indicating something like a wall, if we're visually oriented.

Where I think we'd start to disagree is in the connection between my question
and my divination. But we're really agreeing on quite a lot here. So I think
what we're disagreeing about are the causes of said experience, gods vs.
subconscious/whatever, and the significance of said experience, should I take
that as advice. Actually I like the divination example a bit better than Pecc's
experiment, because in some ways, there's more to agree on, I'm sure just about
everybody in this forum has at least SEEN some sort of divination take place.
So we don't have to have a fight about just which method the gods might be
picking to communicate with us, it's runes or tarot or Yijing (I Ching) or
whatever divination system you like.

Now I'll tackle Jl's theory issue. Jl thinks that, by saying I'm using system X
of divination, I'm proposing a whole model of the world predicated on X. So for
instance, if the traditional explanation of X is that god Y grants me knowledge
via X, I'm proposing a theory that there's a god Y who grants me knowledge, and
probably other gods as well, Etc. I'm not really. I'd personally probably
accept that, see my previous post. If X works, and probably some other things
about the worldview as well, and it makes sense, and I see nothing against it,
then even if I don't have a direct experience of god Y, I may trust that the
people who do know what they're talking about, until proven otherwise.

But I'm not proposing a model. Why? Didn't I just say I'd believe it? Sure. But
I'm not saying you have to. If you go "well it's all psychological and my
subconscious and ... but divination system X helps me structure things and
think through decisions and ..." That's fine. Go for it. It's meaningful/useful
to you. DONE! Does that result in fifty million descriptions of the world? So
be it. I think we already ahve that anyway, we've had it for a long time, and
the world seems to be working just fine.

You see, you're jumping over exactly the question that Pecc and I are wondering
about, this:

Why are you guessing I'd write it off as a hallucination? That's EXACTLY what
we're wondering. Are the differences in our belief system that I've had these
experiences and written them off, or that I've never had them at all? Someone
like JL might write them off, but I think it's established that for all our
differences in ontologies (as he puts it), I think a lot more like Pecc than I
do JL.

Incidentally, and probably off the subject, but I've actually read Tarot cards
before, many times. I've gotten quite good at it. And that's one of the
experiences that have made me a materialist!

When I first got them, I was open to the idea that they might have some
divinitory powers, but when I used them to do readings for myself, I didn't
gain any special insight; they didn't tell me anything I didn't already know.

However, when I used them to tell other people's "fortunes," focusing on
abstracts rather than saying that the King of Swords meant you'd be meeting a
dark and very angry man, I got very good at helping people apply the cards to
their own personalities and issues. What I felt I was doing was using the cards
to evoke insights into other people I might not have already had--a way to
think creatively. It also provided a great deal of authority, since any
insights I might have came apparently from the cards instead of from some
college friend.

But I eventually stopped doing readings. No particular reason--I think that
between my peer group changing and general maturity the spooky appeal of
playing with Tarot cards waned. I still have mine in a drawer, though.

Actually, I question what "alive" means, and wonder if it has any meaning.

>Well humans have consciousness.

I believe that is a fairly meaningless statement, and I'm not sure I agree with
it using the common definitions of "consciousness".

>I say the tree communicated with me

And in some manner, I might agree. But my next thought would be to wonder what
information was passed. And how can you verify that the information was passed,
as opposed to just imagining that it was? Surely if some information came from
the tree, you should be able to validate that information in some manner. If
not, then I would say there was no communication.

>How do I decide communicating tree is better than your
>theory where that doesn't happen? Again, you've yet to define "better"

You've MISSED THE POINT! I'm asking YOU to define "better". You've clearly
chosen one of many explanations. I'm asking why you chose that one, versus
others. By what process did you arrive at the conclusion that you communicated
with the tree, versus hallucinated? I'm not talking about what EVIDENCE there
was, I'm talking about the CRITERIA used to parse the evidence, give it weight,
and ultimately make a conclusion.

>Newtonian physics is just plain wrong and Einsteinian physics is clearly
>"better", again without explaining what that means.

I actually described exactly what it means. I laid out 5 criteria by which one
theory could be judged against another.

>determinist and insist I can't make choices, neither can you or anybody else,
>but you then insist I tell you how I make choices. Why? What does it matter?

Because YOU insist you make choices. So I am trying to force you to examine
that conclusion and dig into it, because I believe that it falls apart upon
closer inspection. But if you refuse to break it down, then I guess that helps
to sustain the conclusion, yes?

>everybody in this forum has at least SEEN some sort of divination take place.

I don't think so.

>Jl thinks that, by saying I'm using system X
>of divination, I'm proposing a whole model of the world predicated on X.

No. You always dive WAY too deep in your broad generalizations. I'm saying if
you use system X, then it has some implications, and it models at least part of
the world, to some degree.

If you believe that turning up Tarot cards reveals something about the world
that was previously unknown to you, then that is a model. The cards are
connected to reality. You believe that information in one is directly connected
to information in the other. So, AHA! This is testable!

Observe Tarot card readings over time, write down what they reveal, and measure
against someone who is faking it and randomly guessing. If you find that one
system is no more accurate about the world than the other, then you can
conclude that reading tarot cards is the same as guessing, and you have
disproven your theory that they contain real information connected to the
world.

>But I'm not proposing a model. Why? Didn't I just say I'd believe it? Sure.
But
>I'm not saying you have to.

Totally irrelevant. This isn't about convincing people of your model, it's
about whether your model is actually a representation of reality, and
consistent with observations and other known facts.

Stepp>
>Someone like JL might write them off

Why? I wouldn't write them off as not having happened. I would seek the best
explanation for them.

For example, I do not doubt that religious "experiences" happen. Absolutely.
But do I believe that "God" was the cause? No. I believe that the person has
experienced a state in their brain that can be induced in a number of different
ways. And when they propose that "God" actually induced it, I then say... "hmm,
tell me about this God. What else do you know about him? Is there any more to
him than the inducer of this experience? Oh, yes? He does other things? Tell me
about them."

I don't deny the experience. But I may deny that it is connected to other
things in exactly the same way as the experiencer might.

And please, if you TL;DR'd the last post, answer me this...

Surely you (Gwynn, Pecc, even Stepp) deny the validity of many beliefs held by
many people. Surely you do not accept just anything as being valid and as real
as what you believe, yes?

For example, surely you don't believe that sickness is a matter of evil spirits
being in the blood, which must be drained to rid the body of the spirits. You
reject that, right?

My point is that you apply my kind of thinking already, you just don't
acknowledge it in the same way. There are SOME rules in your brains that are
evaluating different ideas and picking ones to go with.

And while you reject 99% of the theories about reality which have existed in
the world - past and present - I just (to paraphrase Dawkins) take it one
theory further.


What frustrates me is the lack of acknowledgement of the processes that are
similar, or that they even exist at all under your beliefs. As if I am
inventing some strange system of evaluating ideas which reject ideas, and you
would never do such a thing. Even though you ALREADY DO.

Just to clarify, I meant that you would write off the possibility of a mystical

proposition that would require EXTREMELY powerful evidence in order to
overturn.

And frankly, it probably would for me too. But given the basic similarityof my

DEFINITELY the case.

Where do you get the impression that I refuse to grant the fact that I evaluate
beliefs? Of course I evaluate beliefs. My whole point is, you want this sort of
hard core of truth thing, compare the tarot cards to a random guesser, then you
find if they're "really" giving you information about "reality"! That's what
you hear when I say, "I use runes for divination". You hear, "ah, so you're
claiming the runes give you some sort of special access to reality!"

Here's the big thing you're missing though, and I have no idea why, because I
already explained it. No, no I'm not. I'm claiming the runes give ME access to
reality in a way I PERSONALLY don't have. That doesn't mean that because the
runes do that for me, the tarot can't do that for you, or that oracles
involving dice are complete and utter foolishness, or whatever. THAT'S MY
CLAIM. Period, full stop, end of fucking story. Runes do something FOR ME. Can
they do something for you? I have no idea, try it and find out. Or come up with
a question and get somebody to do a reading for you.

See, YOU want this to be some sort of either/or binary exclusive thing, either
the runes/tarot/whatever is giving me information about reality I can't get any
other way, or it's not. I DON'T CARE if you can do fifty three thousand seven
hundred and twelve other things that give you the EXACT same sort of
information I get from runes. I don't CARE that you think I should run
statistical trials on them. It's a simple method of divination, go do it
yourself, if you're interested. Hell I can give you a yes/no method that
involves a string of beads that's even quicker. If that's something that does
it for you, if the only thing you find validity in is something that's been
tested like that, go for it. Be my guest. Me, I'll stick with my pragmatic
approach to reality, thanks.

And THAT is where I think you ARE attempting to deny ideas, yes. Fine, I'm not
interested in that sort of statistical testing you seem to favor. In fact, my
whole point all along has been that there are things OUTSIDE of that
scientific framework. You keep wanting to cram me back into it though, as
though doing statistical trials is the ONLY true method for evaluating these
sorts of things. My whole point has been that it's not the case. Again, if
that's what you personally need, and you're interested in doing it, go for it.
Hell you'd have your own criteria for results set up, so you could reject
anything you thought was too vague or whatever. I'm saying that for me, I tend
to stop at "hey, that works, it's doing something for me that I didn't have
before". Could twelve other things do that? Maybe, yeah. I don't care. This
one's working for me.

First, I'm glad that you recognize that the simplest model is not always the
correct model, so you were sort of over-reaching there with your original
statement. Second, I've been to plenty of scientific conferences, and I can
assure you that when there is some complex issue where there are lots of
competing theories, no one stands up and tries to identify which one is the
simplest one so that they can all go home. They would get laughed out of the
room. Instead, they argue over what experiment can be conducted that could give
results which might decisively eliminate one theory or another. The only

Oh, no, I totally buy that one.  "often often often goes the Christ in the

As far as the principle of parsimony, the only reason that scientists prefer
simple answers to complex answers is that simple answers tend to be easier to
falsify first.  Once you eliminate the simple answers, you start working your
way up to complexity.  You can, and sometimes do, go the other direction:
falsify the complex theories first.  But it's just a matter of efficiency, and
only the scientifically illiterate think that Occam's razor is a scientific
principle or evidence for the truth of a theory (or, for that matter, a reason
to abandon a theory in itself -- at best, it's a reason to postpone testing a
theory until simpler ones are tested first).

Okay. I get that. So you're not really seeking any kind of objective truth, or
shared truth, but rather just whatever makes you feel good and makes life
better? Coping mechanisms for life, so to speak?

See, I think we are all kind of doing that. But for me, I cannot be comfortable
with a belief that is not consistent. So I am continuously trying to refine my
thoughts to match with my observations and all the things I learn. That's what
my brain is seeking in order to be "cope".

Quite honestly, I'm not sure this is a path to happiness. Because the more I
learn, the more complex it becomes to come up with ideas that can explain it
all. As I explore new ideas, and go deeper down the rabbit hole, so to speak,
my brain starts to spin in more ways, trying to resolve all the little
conflicts and lack of continuity. It hurts my brain, though I'm almost
compelled in some strange way to keep exploring it. I seriously wonder if this
kind of intellectual pursuit leads to craziness or something. Though as I keep
exploring, I feel like my eyes are opening to new possibilities, and underlying
truths that are way more awesome and amazing than the perspective I had on the
world just 5 years go.

So are you comfortable with people having beliefs which you think are wrong?
Does that bother you at all? I mean, maybe a religion that you find absurd and
totally dis-provable.

Do you believe that "ignorance is bliss"? Do you think it's perfectly okay for
someone to be less informed and happy to be that way?

That depends on what you mean. I think knowledge is a fine thing, and I think
the pursuit of learning for its own sake is a worthwhile goal. But there are
going to be people who can't pursue it to the same degree I might want to.
They're just not capable of it. Or they don't have the opportunity. Or
whatever. I'm not going to look down on them for that. Then there are people
who COULD pursue something, and just choose not to. They don't have an interest
in it, it doesn't have relevance to their lives, whatever. Again, I'm not going
to look down on them for that.

So suppose I find somebody who believes something I think is easily
disprovable. Again, this depends on what they believe. They may, for instance,
have faith that science will have all sorts of answers for us about damn near
everything, but refuse to admit it's faith. I'll probably tell them about that,
if it comes up in discussion. They might believe in the flying spaghetti
monster. Well OK, I'll offer my reasons why I don't, should it come up in
discussion, but they can believe what they like. It's no skin off my nose.

But suppose they believe blind people are intellectually inferior or something.
That's something different again. Because that's dangerous, to me and others.
So I'll try to disprove it to them, unlikely as that is to work, and what's
more, I'll oppose that view when they expound it to others. Ditto if they
think homosexuals aren't real people, or any number of other beliefs you
might care to name. I equally oppose Muslim radicals who say they need to
blow things up, and people like Sam Harris who say our fear of Islam as a
religion is legitimate and we should let that fear have free reign. So I mean,
I think there's a big difference between "I need to prove your silly belief
wrong because it's wrong", and what I'd consider really worth going after. But
I also think we think these things are, practically speaking, way more
important than they are. Let me bust out a good old untrue chestnut.

For the next month, keep a diary. I want you to record only one thing in it.
Every time the spherical shape of the earth comes up as something relevant,
write it down. Are you reading maps? OK, relevant. Are you using a cellphone?
Not at all relevant. Sure there's satellites involved, so the satellite people
need to know how the earth's shaped, but you don't. I can hand a five ear old
child a cellphone, and they can use it. So what I want you to write down is
ONLY where the shape of the earth is DIRECTLY relevant to something you're
doing/thinking about, i.e. if you didn't know what shape the earth was, it
would be impossible for you to do/think that thing.

Now of course, I say it's untrue, because people like to trot that out, in the
dim dark old days, maybe before Columbus, people thought the earth was flat! Oh
nos! Do I think it's totally awesome that we know the shape of the earth? You
bet. But people like to trot this out like it's something really important, so
important that if you don't know it you may as well be in a coma. But honestly,
I'm guessing if anybody actually bothers to undertake the experiment I'm
proposing, they'll find the number of entries fairly small, unless they read a
lot of maps or work in aerospace stuff or something. I'm not trying to suggest
that ignorance is bliss here. Again, let's illustrate with an example.

Suppose you're in your car and you're navigating with your GPS. Now of course
the shape of the earth is relevant there, back to satellites again. And I
absolutely think that if you have the interest and capacity, go find out ALL
about that, as much as you can. But here's the thing. If you suddenly lost the
knowledge of the shape of the earth, you could still navigate with your GPS
just fine. Nothing whatsoever would change with respect to your experience of
navigating with your GPS. So while it's certainly interesting to know that the
earth is an oblate spheroid, Etc., it's not at all necessary for 99.99% of the
things most of us do in our daily lives.

So if somebody believed the earth was flat, sure, I'd tell them it wasn't.
Sure, I'd point out evidence, like we have space pictures dude, come on, how
fucking awesome is that, space pictures! I'm blind, and even I think that's
pretty damn cool! But I also realize that, in the grand scheme of things, it
probably doesn't really matter all that much. Now, it's possible that this will
indicate other beliefs, and actions based on those beliefs, that I might take
issue with. But other than that, if they just believed the earth was flat? I
dunno man. If I could be friends with an Objectivist, I'm pretty sure I could
handle a flat earther, no problem.

If everyone stuck with the idea that the earth was flat, and no one said, "hey,
we should really let everyone know the roundness!" then we wouldn't have
progressed, would we?

Gwynn seems, to me, to be arguing that all ideas are equal, and we shouldn't
criticize ideas of others, and that if someone wants to believe something that
we think is wrong, then that is just fine.

I disagree. I think that ideas themselves are important. You could argue that
there is "no harm done" by people who want to believe that global warming is a
myth, right? I mean, they can have their opinion. But shouldn't we be fighting
for the "truth"?
Similarly, you could argue that those who are racist but don't harm blacks
should be able to believe whatever they want. Why try to change attitudes?
Perhaps, for them, black=evil *is* true, right? It makes them feel comfortable,
and it helps them explain the world. Should we feel good that racists teach
their children to hate (let's assume they are never violent), because it gives
them a worldview that they are comfortable with?

Jl:

Did you even read what I wrote? Seriously? Because I so don't get where you
claim I'm saying we don't fight for beliefs. I kind of wrote a whole paragraph
about that, you know, homosexuals not being considered human beings, blind
people being considered intellectually inferior, that kind of thing? Do you
remember that at all?

As for every idea being equally valid, I never said that. I think though that
Jl is crusading for this idea that there is "a truth" and we must FIND it, at
ALL COSTS, and then we must TELL people, and they must BELIEVE! I'm saying if
you look at a lot of that stuff, it doesn't matter. OK, so I believe the earth
is flat. I'm clearly wrong. What does that matter, in the grand scheme of
things? To most people's lives, the flatness of the earth, or lack thereof, is
completely and utterly irrelevant.

Let's turn this around for a minute. Suppose I come from fifteen thousand years
in the future. Somehow I prove this to your satisfaction. So it's a given that
I'm from the future, like I claim to be. Now I tell you that Russell was wrong.
We've developed censors that can measure things you can't even conceive of yet,
and the celestial teapot is in fact completely and utterly real. Let's suppose
for the sake of argument that I'm right, whether you can verify that or not is
another matter. Are you going to crusade for belief in the celestial teapot?
Because remember, it's "TRUE"! And we want to find "the truth", don't we?
That's what we're allabout here. And presumably true is true, whether any given
person recognizes it or not.

I'm going to guess you're not going to fight too awful hard for the poor
unrecognized celestial teapot, because it's irrelevant to your life, and it's
unverifiable. But wait, hang on a minute. Suppose I took you and three of your
friends to the celestial teapot and showed it to you. I verified, to your
satisfaction, that said teapot exists. Then I leave. Now there's the four of
you who've had an experience of the celestial teapot, and absolutely nobody
else on the planet. You can't have it again, and you can't make anybody else
have it either. Does it still exist or not? Because what Jl seems to be saying,
in essence, is that no, it doesn't actually exist. We can't form a concensus on
it, so it's not real.

OK, hang on, because we're going to flip this in one more direction. The
scientific community has studied the four of you, and they've concluded, by
their best lights, that you suffered some sort of shared hallucination, not of
me coming from the future, everybody agrees on that, but of the teapot
experience. Don't worry, I'm not going to ask if it's real this time. The four
of you feel that this was a real experience, and not a hallucination. Why
should I attempt to convince you that it was a hallucination?

Keep in mind, it doesn't matter whether it was or not. The question we're
dealing with here is that the four of you have had an experience which, so far
as you can tell, is as real as any other experience. Until the scientists
started going on about shared hallucinations, everything was fine. But the
scientists say there's no way in HELL there's a celestial teapot, there's no
evidence for it whatsoever, and they've got some other reasons that tell them
you experienced a shared hallucination.

Jl says the scientists are right, and it's actually somehow HARMFUL, how isn't
really specified, for him and his three friends to continue to believe there's
a celestial teapot. I'm saying that, unless they're convinced by the evidence
to doubt their own EXPERIENCE!, (please note I said EXPERIENCE and not their
own beliefs about black people or whatever else was brought up), I can't at the
moment see ANY issues with them continuing to believe that they in fact had an
ACTUAL experience of an ACTUAL celestial teapot.

Step. is correct, I haven't yet offered ANYTHING about how we falsify beliefs.
That's because I'm still trying to get Jl to understand that I'm not operating
under the same materialist single truth scientific investigation is the only
way paradigm he seems to be laboring under. I know he SAYS that's not true, but
every single example he brings up comes right back down to that paradigm. But
what does that mean? I'm very much with Step. I have my morals, beliefs, Etc.,
and where appropriate I fight for them.

But I also don't think every single belief has to result in a big fight. If Joe
believes the earth is flat, what's that to me? Jl wants to say "but what about
a whole SOCIETY of Joe believing the earth is flat"? That's really something
different again. What we'd be dealing with then are things said society wanted
to do, e.g. changing textbooks, for instance. That's an action, and we can
fight actions just fine. If that society wanted to restrict avenues of
investigation, I'd fight against that too, because as I said, I think the
pursuit of knowledge is fine, even for its own sake.

But ultimately, Joe's going to believe what Joe's going to believe. So why
should I get all upset about that? Go back to the various teapot examples, if
you really DID have an experience of the teapot, does it MATTER that every
other person on the planet thinks you're wrong? Conversely, does it actually
HARM any other person on the planet for you to believe you really had an
experience of said teapot when they're right, it WAS a shared hallucination?

Actually, Step., I take back my agreement with you. I did in fact post at least
one criterion for falsifiability in #32824. Jl promptly said I couldn't do that
in #32826, because then he could claim a bunch of stuff nobody's ever claimed,
like all the store santas are instantiations of a metasanta whose form we can
only guess at, or some such bullshit. I guess we're kind of back to where we
were before. However muddled I'm being, and I'm not saying I'm at all coherent,
I'm doing my best to respond to people, Jl in particular. Jl responds with
things like "no", "I question what life is", and claims I dont respond to him,
even though I explained, fairly clearly I thought, why I questioned what he
meant by "better". He ignores half of his own examples and answers questions
with more questions.

I certainly don't claim to be the most rational person in the world, and that's
fine. I think there are lots and lots of things that either don't involve
rationality at all, or involve it only partially. But just for Step., I'll give
another example of  how we might falsify something. Suppose I hear a voice, and
I say it's a god, and that god has told me to quit trying to do music and
become a popcorn salesman. I'm seriously considering doing it, because I'm
really dumb in this example, even more than I usually am I mean which is pretty
damn dumb half the time. You say, "look man, you're decent at music, give it a
shot at least, and why do you believe this is a god anyway? That seems like a
pretty weird thing for a god to say, it doesn't sound like ANY other
experiences you've told me about. Let me look into it at least, OK"?

I agree. You find a speaker hidden in one of my bedroom walls, and it turns out
I only hear said god in my bedroom. You trace the wires and find a playback
device. You play it for me, and it's my friend Tom telling me to become a
popcorn salesman. I object, remember I'm really extra dumb here, that that's
Tom, and it doesn't sound like the god at all. So you fire up your computer and
run Tom's voice through a few simple effects, and poof!, we have the sound of
said god. Now while we don't have PROOF, i.e. absolute certainty that I never
heard a god, I'm not sure how you reasonably still believe that this is a god,
and not my friend Tom fucking with me.

Obviously I'm not suggesting you get to that level of detail to consider
something wrong. But again, this depends whether we're talking for me
personally, or something with wider scope. I'm going to evaluate a theory that
dinosaurs ate most of the planets we used to have WAY differently than I'm
going to evaluate uncle Frank telling me he saw somebody disappear in a flash
of light. That's not saying I'll consider one to be correct either. But even
though I might dismiss uncle Frank's claim, I probably won't have nearly as
much thought going into it.

And again, if Frank still says he saw that, well so what? If thirty scientists
start pushing for the rogue planet-devouring dinosaur theory, that's going to
have consequences, and then we're back to my previous post on actions again.
Maybe uncle Frank really did see somebody disappear in a flash of light. Or
maybe he was high. Or maybe they used a firework or flair or something to blind
him and he got disoriented and it all came out as, they were there one second,
then they disappeared in a flash of light.

Jl seems to think it's vitally important that we figure out this mystery, or at
least, that we stay firmly on the side of hallucination or something. I'm
saying, who cares? Fine, uncle Frank swears to his dying day that these people
were there, and then they disappeared in a flash of light, like every
ghost/alien movie you've ever seen. OK, and? It's pretty unlikely they were
government scientists playing with a new teleporter prototype, but then again,
it's not totally impossible either.

So who the hell am I to get "so high and mighty" about my beliefs on the
subject? Hell, maybe they were ghosts or aliens, for all I know. I mean, I'd
kind of doubt that if all I had to go on was my fictive uncle's story, but
that's me. And knowing my family, my fictive uncle was probably drunk off his
ass or something anyway. But that only matters insofar as poor fictive uncle
Frank wants me to AGREE with him that he did indeed see ghosts, aliens,
government testers, or whatever. What I'm trying to figure out is why Jl thinks
it's so VITALLY important that I convince uncle Frank that he's wrong, and it
was REALLY and TRULY a hallucination, or kids playing with flairs, or whatever
acceptable materialist explanation hobby horse we want to ride this week.

I'm not proposing that we go around correcting everyone's errors in facts and
logic. That's not even practical.

I'm saying, if you want to introspect, and you want to find truth, there are
ways to go about it.

If you are happy trusting your experiences, and never want to question them or
doubt them, and you want to take everything at face value based on how it feels
to you, then you cn do that. I think that's how a lot of people operate. It
may, in fact, make you happier. But I believe that there are greater truths
that we can learn about if we try. And the people who are naturally driven to
seek that out are the ones who move society forward.

Imagine where we would be if everyone stayed happy with their beliefs a few
thousand years ago, never questioned them, and never tried to push forward.
We'd be stuck, making no progress.

Now, would that be worse? I guess I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't. Maybe our
current state is really no better than we were 3000 years ago. I guess it could
be argued as such.

Jl:

No, that's NOT what I'm arguing, AT ALL! But you're clearly not reading what
I'm writing, at this point.
[Philosophy> msg #32859 (0 remaining)] Read cmd ->

Most of my last post was about one way we can disprove an experience. So
clearly I'm not saying, hey you have an experience, trust it, no matter what!
I'm certainly arguing against the hermeneutics of suspicion stance Jl's taking
towards experience, i.e. they are somehow innately untrustable, we must
approach them with suspicion and only trust them after we've somehow externally
verified them. Because I do think we can have perfectly valid experiences,
ourselves, that aren't repeatable or externally verifiable. Sure, a whole crowd
of people could have an experience whose cause they're mistaken about. But I
don't see why that should lead us to the extreme position that if our
experience can't be verified by certain types of external evidence, or doesn't
fit with certain assumptions, it must, of necesity, be false.

So yes, I'm more inclined to trust my experiences than say, arguments. Let's
put it this way. Suppose I see a person far away. I don't claim it's a ghost,
just a person. Dawkins talks about things, in The God Delusion, like this thing
he has that looks like a jumble until you look at it a certain way, then it's
Einstein's face. He offers this as an example of how the brain can trick
itself, or some such. OK, that's fine. That's entirely possible. What
justification do you have for saying I didn't in fact see a person? You can't
just go "oh well look at the Einstein mask thing"! You'd better have something
else. Maybe it's easy, I said I saw a person five miles away, and that's pretty
much impossible for human vision. Maybe there are things that lead you to
question whether I could do that, it's really foggy out.

My point is, to take a page from Jl's book, you don't do this normally. You
don't go "oh you claim you just ate lunch? Are you sure? Because Dawkins has
this Einstein mask that ... your brain can trick you ..." More often than not,
you trust that your experiences are in fact your experiences. So I'm apparently
taking that farther than Jl's comfortable with. OK, I'm not asking Jl to go
there with me. I don't see why I should be called ignorant for that stance. Oh
and as for falsifiability, I haven't gone into it a ton because I don't think
there's a set of rules for it. I think we falsify experiences with other
experiences. Even science does that, that's why we have experiments and all
that.

For the record, I don't assume experiences are false. I only suspect that they
might be false if there are reasons for it. I happen to believe there are more
reasons to be suspicious than you.

If you say that Tarot cards contained information that was transferred to you,
yeah, I'm instantly suspicious of that, because of the OVERWHELMING amount of
evidence to the contrary for such phenomenon. My instinct is to believe that
there is some more accurate explanation, based on my previous knowledge. I'm
not AGAINST the idea that the cards held information, but the bar is really
high for you to prove it to me. And no, I don't think you are free to think
what you want. I think you are wrong. I don't think it's bad or insulting to
say that. We all have such opinions about something.

Now, what DO I think about such things?

* I absolutely believe they can be positive, because I recognize that thinking
  something has an effect on other thoughts and feelings. So you can make
  yourself feel better, even be healthier, just through thought. I have no
  doubt that Tarot cards help some people in this way.

* I of course think that the cards act as some kind of trigger for your own
  thoughts that you may have had anyway. They don't give you information, but
  they may bring up certain things to your attention. But I do not think that
  this is exposing some information that the cards had.

* I do think that someone can convincingly duplicate the experience of reading
  cards (or doing any other of these types of things) such that no person could
  differentiate between the "con" and the "real thing". For that reason, there
  is effectly no difference between the con and real thing, so it invalidates
  it. Skeptics have shown over and over via cold reading, etc.

So yeah, I think there are better explanations. But it's not about Tarot cards,
it about how you approach these things, and how you figure out what you
believe.

I believe that we all map our experiences to prior experiences and things we
know. Analogy is the core of cognition, as Hofstadter says. That's all we do is
compare experiences to previous ones, and group them together to form new
ideas.

So my experiences have been different than yours, so I will compare everything
differently. That's not to say one is right or wrong, just different. The
problem comes when we DO share some common experiences, and our two different
ideas don't say the same thing about our common experiences.


In short, we humans have shown repeatedly, to such a convincing level, that our
minds fool ourselves all the time. It's really hard to know what we know. But
we are continuing to develop tools and techniques to refine what we know and
improve the accuracy of our model of the world. Trusting our experiences
without acknowledging this fails to leverage the history of our brains to weed
out the ideas that don't make as much sense.

A couple. The biggie is that you think the anti-mysticism evidence is a LOT
stronger than it really is. That in and of itself isn't an inconsistency or an
irrationality, but it reveals a crucial one: at the core of all inductive logic
is an intuitive, irrational leap. This is what Hume realized 300 years ago, of
course. You never accumulate enough evidence to prove a model, or even to
disprove someone else's model; the point at which you choose one over the other
is always going to be fraught with your own personal preferences.

You probably think that you do recognize this. However, you don't apply it to
your own thoughts when evaluating others' truth-claims. You're so insistent
that the data is in and that mysticism lost that you aren't evenly evaluating
the mystical statements of others: you basically start from the assumption that
they're wrong. And in that sense, your personal beliefs are not consistent with
your arguments.

In connection to the conversation about absolute morality, I started reading a
science fiction novel that required me to go read about game theory, and so I'm
1/4 way through a book on game theory and a notion has occurred to me.

We could actually derive a rational absolute (well, nearly) morality on the
basis of game theory.  For example, we could come together and derive value
functions for particular social values.  Let's say we decide that (and this is
just spitballing):

Freedom = 5
Justice = 4
Life = 3
Property = 2
Happiness = 1

(These are arbitrary, but we could come up with a rigorous way of determining
the utility functions for each category, or different categories, and we could
even poll everyone and average the values I imagine)

So for any action, we can determine the p of its furthering that value (again,
here's a place we'd need to define what furthering the value would mean, but
probably that wouldn't be impossible to estimate).  We can then determine the
rightness of any action by:
f(m) = p(F) + p(J) + p(L) + p(P) + p(H)
An action is "right" if f(m) for a particular action is higher than for other
actions.

Obviously, this is the philosophic calculus of the Utilitarians, ain't it?  But
then again, we have game theory and they didn't.  I wonder if someone who
understands the theory better than I do (you know, has read more than a quarter
of a book on teh topic) could make an application to ethics that would acheive
a mathematical argument for particular actions.  The hedonic calculus wasn't
exactly rigorous or effective (iirc, it led to a nervous breakdown for one of
its largest proponants).

[hmm -- maybe it should be p(n(F)) etc, with n being number of people effected.
Should I throw a person overboard to save the whole crew?

f(y) = 1(5*3) + 0(4*3) + 1(3*3) + 0(2*3) + 0(1*3)
f(y) = 15 + 9 = 24
 . . . hrmm, wait, no, that's not quite right.  Bleh.  I should write this out
before I start typing it . . .

I've tried really hard to express myself, mostly to fight against Jl's idea
that we're coming from radically different worlds or something. But I think I
might have to agree with him now.

"And no, I don't think you are free to think
what you want. I think you are wrong."

Here's a question, Jl. How are you going to stop me? See, I'm starting from a
very basic assumption. I AM free to think what I want. I literally have the
freedom and capacity to think whatever I like. For instance, I can reject the
hell out of your shared idea space thing, and there's not a damn thing you can
do to stop me from doing so whatsoever. So does that mean I think people SHOULD
think whatever they want?

No, but I acknowledge that, ultimately, there's nothing I can do to stop them.
Suppose my fictive uncle Frank thinks I'm an idiot, and I'm an idiot BECAUSE
I'm blind. He just thinks the blind have diminished mental and physical
capacity BECAUSE they're blind. So one day we get into it. I show him I can use
multiple computers. I write some programs for him. I play some games with him
and beat him. I discuss politics with him, and so on. We get to the end of all
of that, and he still claims the blind have diminished capacities.

So now what? If he's not free to think whatever he wants, how is it that he's
still thinking contrary to me? Maybe you mean he's technically CAPABLE of
thinking whatever he wants, but he SHOULDN'T. So how does that square with your
deterministic outlook? I'd say that's another one of the assumptions you're
missing. You keep talking about relativity and such in generalities, but you
seem to be doing your damnedest to demonstrate that I'm thinking about things
the wrong way. You've implied I'm ignorant, and that I'm not interested in the
truth because I'm not asking the same questions/looking at things the way you
are. You claim things are deterministic, evne ethics and morals, assuming they
exist, but when we get to specifics, you're talking like we have choices, there
are ways we SHOULD and SHOULDN'T think, which implies we have a choice.

Two points:
a) This is an argument against data and fact, rather than process. I'm actually
   more interested in the process than the facts and conclusions, as none of
   us can be well-read in everything. I'm more interested in examining the
   reasoning machine that facts get fed into as input.
b) I disagree. That argument is a whole different ball of wax, though, and one
   I don't really care to have. Having some exposure to the military attempts
   at capitalizing on mysticism, psychics, etc and how much of a miserable
   failure it was, I'm not easily swayed anymore. And of course the lucrative
   yet unawarded prizes from people like James Randi for anyone who can
   demonstrate mysticism is further evidence against it. I would love for that
   stuff to exist, and I spent many years or my earlier life exploring it and
   trying to figure out if there was something to it (and hoping there was). My
   conclusion was that it is 99.9% hoax, and .1% mystery, and as of yet I've
   not seen any compelling reason to change my belief. Though I would be open
   to it if something came up.

Nevertheless, I think that's one of my conclusions, not an assumption. I
certainly have evidence for it and reason behind it, whether you agree or not.
So I don't think it's really an assumption.


Pecc> Evolution is game theory, to some degree. If you want to see how it plays
out in a very complex model like you've described, just look at humans. We
balance all these different things very quickly and intuitively, and reach some
conclusion about the "rightness" of things. There are layered priorities, and
one bubbles to the top.

I've always loved game theory, but I've yet to find a good book about it that I
want to read. So I know of it more by references in other books and what
limited reading I've done on the web. It seems fascinating to me.

I've been following this discussion with some interest.  Something that I
wonder about is this notion of progress suggested by JL's talk about moving
forward with a scientific approach.  It seems to me that forward progress
implies a direction (though not necessarily a destination).  In this case, I
think it's clear that we (as humans) have made huge progress in our ability to
understand/manipulate the material world.  To the extent that such progress is
predicated upon a scientific and/or materialistic understanding of or approach
to the world and progress in this direction is fundamentally desirable, I would
agree with JL about the benefits of taking this approach to the world.

That said, I think there are other directions in which we can make worthwhile
progress that are not dependent upon such a world view, and in fact may be
hampered by it at times.  I suspect our ability to relate to the world in an
emotional/empathetic way has been diminished by the scientific-materialistic
approach to things (with an assistance from our monetary system, perhaps).  I
think this ability to connect is important to the health of ourselves and the
world in which we live.

To use Gwynn's experience of connecting in some way with a tree as an example.
Whatever happened in that moment on a material level, if anything, is not
really the important part of the story to me.  The important part of the story
is the emotional connection he made with that tree, and the impact that has on
his perspective of the world.  That connection likely enhances his ability to
feel empathy for that tree (and perhaps other individuals as well).  As well,
the empathy he has for the tree increases his ability to make decisions for
the benefit of a world larger than just himself.  Without such empathy, we
have a tendency to act much more selfishly as individuals (and collectively as
a species).  Such selfish behavior, especially with our current abilities to
manipulate the material world, can ultimately be to our deteriment (as
individuals, but more clearly our collective existence as a species).

Richard K. Nelson, a somewhat well-known anthropologist/writer who happens to
live in the same town as I do, writes/narrates a nature-related radio show
where he talks about the subject of the program from both scientific and
indigenous perspectives that he's researched.  One of the things he's commented
on is how he doesn't know if the indigenous understanding of things (in terms
of spirits or what have you) is literally true, but he does acknowledge the
profound difference it's made for him to act as if they are.  In particular
his experience of, and relationship to, the natural world has been much more
meaningful, with other beneficial impacts as well, as a result of following
along with  indigenous patterns of understanding, even while recognizing they
may not be literally true.

To carry it to the tarot card example of this conversation - I remember
Steppenwolf talking about using those cards a long time ago and being
impressed with his comments about them.  I don't recall that he had any
particular belief in them as a mystical power, but by following the pattern
of tarot reading he was able to gain insights that he might not have otherwise
noticed (it's probably been nearly 15 years, so I may be misremembering some
details).  I had the impression that in essence, he concluded the structure
(and probably randomness) provided an external means of breaking out of
internal patterns of thoughts, and it was this process that allowed for new
insight, but that insight was still very real, even though he felt it arose
out of a fundamentally random (not spiritual) process.

I have to wonder what difference it makes if you take someone who looks at
tarot from the perspective that I've attributed to the Steppenwolf of 15 years
ago and someone who looks at tarot from the perspective of powers in the
cards.  As a practical matter, it may make little difference for the person
who actually practices tarot.  On the other hand, someone who accepts as
likely the mystical power of tarot cards, is more likely to use the tarot
cards and gain benefit.  On the down side, such a person may also be more
susceptible to some kinds of fraud.  Someone who rejects the mystic
understanding may be more likely to also give up tarot as an aid to
reflection.  In the absence of some other effective means to gain a different
perspective, they lose out on this benefit (though would be much less
susceptible to some kinds of fraud).

For myself, I've come to a place in life where I feel like it is beneficial
for me to act as though I can connect with the world around me in a
fundamental way (which for me encompases experiences that people typically
describe in spiritual terms).  I do not know if this view and the experiences
(or more precisely, the interpretation of those experiences I may use with this
approach) is fundamentally true in a materialistic sense.  However, I also
don't believe it is likely to be knowable.  What's more important to me than
truth (or lack thereof) is the practical outcome of this approach.  How does
it impact the quality of life for me (and those around me)?

I think this might relate the disagreement JL and Gwynn seem to be having
about how to reject beliefs (which we all seem to do).  My understanding is
that Gwynn is far less concerned with true/false beliefs, and far more
interested in the effect those beliefs have on (his) quality of life (in some
sense).  JL seems more interested in truth/falsity (or perhaps more
specifically, internal consistency) as a guiding standard for evaluating
understanding and belief.  If I'm correct in this regard, I think we're all
on the same page when it comes to the fact that we reject beliefs, but the
standards we use to evaluate such beliefs are not the same (which seems like
it's old news, but it's not clear to me that we're doing very well at
understanding each other's standards).

Well, I reject the idea of "proof", because I don't believe we can objectively
prove anything anyway. IMO, it is "rational" if a belief system is consistent
with itself and other knowledge/observation. I don't believe that there is only
one way to view the world that is correct. But I believe that whatever view we
pick, we should make sure that it doesn't contradict itself. Because if we
allow contradiction, we lose the ability to say anythng meaningful, because
everything becomes equally true.

>What do you mean by "objective truth"?

I mean something that is universally true, and not dependent on an observer's
perspective. Something that exists and persists outside of your own experience
of it.

>OK, so if you're not interested in stopping me from thinking in a particular
>way or some particular idea, what do you mean when you say you think I'm

I'm not sure that I said we're not free to think whatever we want. I believe
that there is objective truth, and just because someone experiences it
differently doesn't mean they are correct. For example, if someone says the
earth is flat, I think they are wrong. They may THINK it's flat, and that may
even be entirely internally consistent with their observations, but I have
_more information_ than they do, and I can see the inconsistency in their
belief while they cannot.

So maybe that's what I mean - someone with more information than someone else
may be able to detect inconsistencies in the person's beliefs, and conclude
that they are wrong. Even though the believer themselves thinks they are
consistent, and their belief matches with all their observations.

Gwark>
Your post made me think about the experiments with prayer - people praying for
a sick person has no impact on them getting better. But if the sick person
*knows* they are being prayed for, they actually do get better faster. And if
they are part of it, it's even better.

So clearly it's not the prayer itself that has any power, but the process of
believing in prayer, and reinforcing the belief that you are being helped. In a
similar way, perhaps Tarot cards have no power, but if you *believe* they have
power, then you actually get benefit from it. So in that sense, you can
actually believe anything you want - it's the BELIEF that is beneficial.

So that's why all the religions of the world think they are correct, because
they really do help people. Facts don't even matter. You can believe in any
religion you want, and it will help you. And in the same sense, perhaps my
belief in science helps me in the same way. I reinforce my beliefs through my
observations, and my brain rewards itself.

>I think we're all
>on the same page when it comes to the fact that we reject beliefs, but the
>standards we use to evaluate such beliefs are not the same

Exactly, which is where I was going in the beginning. Trying to understand the
standards that other people use to reject beliefs, and compare them to my own.
Perhaps to see if there is one set of standards that works better than another.
Perhaps to see if there are ways to evaluate ideas that are different than my
own but equally as valid.

That's a pretty accurate summary, yep. In fact, and maybe I won't have to now,
I was thinking of writing something up on animism that involved pragmatism,

ACTING like an animist could give you benefits you weren't getting. It wouldn't

Gwynn> I can't prove to you that colors exist. What I can show you is that
there is a lot of evidence for colors existing, and the existence of colors is
consistent with the world you do experience, even if not directly.

Colors help cars know when to stop and go, for example. You have probably
experienced the orderly nature of traffic, and perhaps appreciated not being
hit by cars.

Colors are the only means by which a painting does not appear as a canvas of
nothingness. Since art museums exist and you can surely read about art and
peoples' love for it, colors are probably implied.

Colors are what make an LCD screen visible to humans. Since many people use
computers, and you know that companies are motivated by profit and probably
wouldn't make a product that has no purpose, you can probably assume that the
ability of monitors to create discernable color exists.


So I cannot PROVE to you that colors exist, and our two brains will probably
never form a similar pattern of neurons that we label "red". I cannot transfer
my context that helps me define "red" because it depends on sight which you
lack, so I cannot transfer my experience to yours.

But by looking at your other experiences, you can INFER that something called
color exists. You can't experience it directly, but you can experience its
effects, give it a label, and relate it to things you know.


Now, contrast that to me saying that I just experienced a whisper of a pink
unicorn spirit (I like unicorns). Could I somehow convince you to believe me?
Probably not, because I cannot map my experience to ANYTHING in our shared
universe. I cannot come up with anything that would help you infer the
existence of the pink unicorn spirit.


So... here's my point, if I haven't made it well already:

I have opinions when your experiences and beliefs touch on things that I also
experience. If someone says "there was a worldwide flood" then I think "ah, but
if that's the case, then surely we would see X, right?" And we can start
talking about whether the flood belief matches up with other beliefs and
experiences. Because your belief implies things about the world that I also
experience, and they don't match up! If your belief were true, I would observe
something that I do not. So how do we resolve this?!

If your beliefs say nothing about the world that I experience, then that's
different. You say "I love my fiancee". Okay, that's cool, I have nothing to
say about that, because it doesn't imply anything else in my world. Nothing
contradicts it. Now, if I witnessed you beating her and calling her names in
private, that WOULD cause some contradiction, and I would suspect that you were
not being honest with me.


I like picking out inconsistencies and pointing out contradictions. It's part
of what makes me very good in software development. People always come to me
with ideas and ask me what impact I can see as a result of their decisions,
because I'm pretty good at spotting something way down the road where things
don't add up, and need to be resolved. That's just how my brain works, good or
bad. So when I see people talk about experiences, I can see a logical argument
20 steps away where they contradict themselves, so I start questioning their
belief. When they can't see 20 steps down the road, they think it's kind of
annoying, and that I'm just arguing to argue, etc. But if they could just go
down that logical road, they might see the inconsistency too, and realize that
their belief may not be consistent with other beliefs, and it's something they
should strive to resolve.


I apologize for typing so much. I tend to ramble. It annoys me about myself. I
find it hard to communicate detailed ideas in text :)

But you totally skipped the first question. Would you like to try answering
that one? Because, aside from questioning your questioning of my or anybody
else's experiences, I'm trying to get you to answer another fundamental
question you've yet to even touch on. For all your talk of relativism and
people being able to see the world in different ways and all that, you still
keep insisting that we should all go down this "logical road" that you see. You
seem to think there's some reason to do it in and of itself, that whether I can
experience colors or not, it's better for me to admit the existence of colors
than it is to go with my direct experience and say, there's no such thing as
colors, as far as I can tell.

In other words, you seem to think my life would somehow be impoverished if I
honestly refused to admit the existence of colors. But that impoverishment
wouldn't be due to any experience I could or couldn't have, it would simply be
due to the fact, according to you, that I'm wrong when I say there aren't
colors. That seems to be your big issue, that I'm wrong, and even though I
can't myself observe colors, I should admit they exist, so I'll be right.
Because being "wrong" somehow hurts me, "wrong" according to you, mind. Because
I still can't verify colors for myself.

You SAY that colors are the only thing keeping order in traffic. I'll point to
a study that shows if you take away road signs, something I can verify, drivers
tend to do better, because they're forced to look out for things themselves,
rather than obeying signs. That says to me what keeps order in traffic is the
innate desire for self-preservation, not your ficticious colors. I could go on
to similarly attack your other reason to infer colors, I'm sure. So my point
is, I might have good reason not to infer colors too. And if I do that, and
stick to my claim that colors don't exist, how does that hurt me?

Gwynn> I'm seeking truth. What are you seeking? Comfort?

That's not even being snarky. Are you not driven to resolve contradictions in
your beliefs? If not, I don't understand. That doesn't make sense to me.

It reminds of when people say things like "Well, I don't know how it works, but
I know that God saved my life. There are some things we'll never know."

OMG! To me, that's just acceptance of ignorance. Which is fine, I guess,
because it helps people maintain happiness and comfort etc. But that doesn't
bring me comfort. For me, I get comfort and happiness when things reach a
logical equilibrium and consistency. When contradictions creep in, it's like an
infection in my brain.

(As a side note, I've often wondered if logical/mathematical/scientific
thinking is actually a disease, causing people such as myself to be blind to
the alternate reality of life, which so many other people seem to find so easy
to accept. But then I doubt that when I look around and see all these people
using technology and living long lives of happiness which are ENABLED by the
results of these logical/mathematical/scientific minds!)


Colors... Yes, you could make an argument for an alternate theory where colors
do not exist. I think you would find that as we discussed it at length, that
your theory would have to grow increasingly complex and you would really
struggle to keep it internally consistent and in line with all our shared
observations, to the point where it would ultimately be impossible to do so.
That's when my "color theory" would win, and you might be compelled to accept
it.
Unless, of course, you stopped the argument early and invoked some mystical
reasoning like "well, I can't explain it, it just works that way". This is a
common self-preservation technique of our brains, that triggers at different
times for different people. When our bliefs are sufficiently question so as to
start questioning fundamental beliefs we have about our own self and ego, then
it is a threat to ourself, and we invoke ignorance as a shield. This is common
in religious folk, for example.
(And to be clear, I'm not saying you do this specifically, because you seem
like an intelligent and deep-thinking person. This is just an observation about
general human behavior)

And on the topic of "ignorance is bliss"...

I really do think it's true. Our brains are machines that model what we
perceive. We're continually taking in input, which changes our internal brain
structure to store representations of our world, to varying degrees of
accuracy. The more we experience the same things, the more our beliefs get
reinforced, ad the more likely we are to encode new experiences using our
existing structures, and therefore "think" of them in those terms.

So if we live in a world without a lot of variety in our inputs, we built up a
representation of the world that is continually reinforced by observations that
match up to our existing model. Our brains like this.

But, what to do when we experience something that is not within our existing
representation of the world? If our brains are sufficiently dynamic and not too
reinforced in any one way, we can continually re-shape it to encode for the new
input. But if our brain patterns are fairly rigid, we really, really, really
don't like that. It's hard to destroy the old patterns that don't fit the new
input. So we either fight hard to fit the new input into the existing model, or
we throw out the input and ignore it.

Ignorance is bliss. If you isolate yourself from new ideas and experiences, you
never have to experience the discomfort of having to fit new things into
existing models that don't match up. You can continually reinforce your
existing model, giving yourself little bits of happiness along the way.

The problem comes when you do get new input. It makes life really hard for
you, and you have to really fight to figure out how to process it. As you are
exposed to more and more new input, you find that your model fits less and
less. Discomfort ensues. Life is hard. You struggle to build up a new model
that can handle all this variety of input, but it's really hard. The physiology
of your brain may not be physically equipped to properly model it all, and
you're left with inconsistencies and contradictions, and your brain is trying
to make sense of conflicting input.

I believe that some peoples' brains are made different, and can better adapt to
a variety of input. I believe that peoples' experiences as babies and young
children dramatically affect how their models begin forming, and how adaptable
they are to new inputs. I believe that being exposed to as much information and
experiences as possible helps avoid reinforcing too many models that don't fit
with the world you haven't yet experienced. And I believe that if your brain
physiology is sufficient to handle the load, that a person can process a lot of
different input and create a model of increasing complexity to handle much of
it - though not all.

We cannot fully represent the world we observe without BEING the world we
observe. So we are stuck with forever having an incomplete model, and always
being at risk of finding some new piece of information that we can't properly
process. What we do in those cases kind of defines who we are, and how our
brain machines work.

Ignorance is bliss.

If you can form an internally consistent belief system, and then shield
yourself from any conflicting observations or experiences, then maybe you'll be
the happiest brain on the planet. And I'm not sure that's a bad thing.

I think that, if you asked people, "Would you give up your beliefs if you could
ever be convinced that they are wrong?", most people would answer yes.

I think that as a rule, we all want to believe only true things--that a false
world is somehow flawed.

And that's something I think valuable about JL's approach here. When it comes
to one's values, most people on a rational level rate truth very highly. This
is why, for example, creationists are so insistent on finding a rational way to
tie the data into their theories, even if there explanation is "God did it to
test our faith." (This IS a rational explanation, by the way, it's just
mind-bogglingly stupid. At least, it's not INHERENTLY irrational.) And I do
think that in many ways people do blind themselves to their own inconsistencies
in order to not admit to themselves that certain cherished beliefs are probably
false.

I still think that JL gives some faith-based explanations very short shrift,
and I still am not convinced that a lot of his assumptions aren't based on pure
faith too. But I think the general model--that truth is a positive value--is a
good one.

I think it's a good one too. My problem is, Jl keeps doing this "oh well I'd
hammer on your no color theory and we'd find an inconsistancy, then you'd have
to admit I'm right". What I want to find out is, what happens if that doesn't
happen? I don't mean out of ignorance, or my refusing to believe things, Etc. I
mean suppose I come up with a perfectly credible alternative for X being based
on color and you can't prove me wrong?

Jl says I should, at that point, accept everybody else's testimony on color,
presumably because we can determine they can see and I can't. But I want to
know what happens if I refuse todo that, and stick with my own experiences.
There's no color in my world, period, end of story. What I want Jl to do, or
somebody at this point, is to defend the idea that:

1. Truth is better than falsehood.
2. What I'm doing by rejecting color IS in fact a falsehood.
3. Therefore, even though I can't have ANY experience of color, I should accept
it anyway.
4. I should accept it because? Some sort of consequences should happen, you
should be able to demonstrate how I'm worse off by not accepting it.

Because really, what we're dealing with is Jl saying this HIS experiences and
the things he derives from comparing them are better than MY expeirences and
the things I derive by comparing them. I'm going with Jl's own definitions
here. We're both learning by analogy and comparing experiences. Mine lead me to
go "a tree communicated with me", and Jl's led him to go "no really it didn't,
and the only reason you don't see that is because you're not probing it deep
enough". We all learn by experiences, but Jl thinks I should adopt his, rather
than trust my own.

Why should I do this? Because truth is better than falsehood. And Jl somehow
can use HIS experiences to pass judgment on MY experiences, so much so that he
thinks I should abandon my own judgment of my own experiences. In other words,
I should accept colors, because he says so, even though I can never experience
them. I'm saying, practically speaking, nothing really happens to my life if I
reject colors. So does it really matter if I do it? I'm not saying I
necessarily SHOULD do it, I'm just trying to figure out what awful terrible
thing is supposed to happen if I actually do.

Sure. But then we're right back to, how are we evaluating truth? It's entirely
TRUE to say that for me, colors don't exist. While I accept your reports of
colors, and I accept the whole wavelengths of light thing, colors literally do
not occur in my world. So let's take a weaker stance. I admit colors exist, for
you. But I don't talk about them, I don't deal with them, they're completely
unimportant to me. I don't want to hear you telling me about them, I don't
accept anything based on them, e.g. "no you should wear this other shirt
because the colors clash", Etc. Like, say, the burial practices of the
Neanderthals, they're just some random bit of data I happen to know about the
world.

So now we come back to the question. Practically speaking, what's the
difference? Fine, I accept colors as true, they exist. But in all other ways, I
deny them. If that's not hurting my life, and maybe you think it is in which
case, feel free to explain, then I'm still trying to figure out why removing
"other people experience them", i.e. they exist for others, is a huge problem.
I mean, isn't this precisely what the new atheists are all about? That whole,
"we just go one god further" and all that? Whether you believe in a god or not,
Christianity and Islam and Judaism and .... exist. But the atheists claim they
have no relevance to their lives whatsoever. They're not interested in
experiencing them, or anything like that.

At bottom, I'm not trying to deny anything. I'm trying to get Jl to
explain/justify WHY he thinks it's so vitally important that I DON'T do
something like that, say, deny the existence of colors, based on the very true
observation that I have no experience of them whatsoever. Let me put it another
way.

It's not so much that I'd be denying colors, as saying they don't matter to me
one little bit. Fine, claim they exist all you want, I don't perceive them, so
why should I care? Jl seems to think I should care for some sort of existential
reason about "truth". His experience of colors, and his claims based on them,
should lead me to have some sort of conclusion about their positive existence,
because then I'm more true or something. But if I just say "look, that's fine,
you people talk about colors all you like, I just don't care one way or the
other, maybe they're reall, maybe your brain's tricking you because it's really
so easy for that to happen it's difficult to even know what we know", that's
supposed to be this big issue. But people do that ALL the time. Jl's doing it
throughout this discussion. Take just about any skeptic/atheist, they're doing
it too.

I mean, Jl's saying he doesn't believe there's ghosts, let's say, or neutrinos
that are heavier than white dwarfs, or whatever you care to name, because
there's "no evidence", i.e. at bottom, nobody has a credible experience of
them. I've got a pretty damn credible experience of no colors, let me tell you.
They actually tried to figure out if I could tell any difference, they
SUPPOSEDLY showed me different colored lights, they all looked the same to me!
(And yes they actually did that, and yes I accept that they were actually
different colors) So you see my point here. I'm actually using Jl's arguments
concerning these SUPPOSED colors and my experiences of them, or lack thereof,
as the case may be. And I'm still trying to figure out A., why I should admit
the existence of colors, counter to everything I've experienced, and B., what
catastrophe will happen if I don't.

Okay, not to derail the *fascinating* "What does JL think truth is" discussion
we've only had a billion times, but here's another stab at using game theory to
decide between whether or not a crew of four people should throw someone
overboard in order to save their lives.

The utility values of moral values:
Freedom 5
Justice 4
Life 3
Property 2
Happiness 1
Of course, these are arbitrary, but I think that's one of the things that's
interesting about this: we can use it as a means to test our relative ranking
of moral values against our intuition.

So, should the three survivors throw someone (against their will) overboard to
lighten the load and survive?  For simplicy, I'll assign a value of p as a
binary choice between 1 and 0.

f(x) = pnF + pnJ + pnL + pnP + pnH
f(y) = 1*3*5 + 0*4*4 + 1*3*3 + 1*0*2 + 0*4*1
[I'm assuming that property is irrelevant to everyone on teh boat, and no one
will be happy killing someone]
f(n) = 1*5*4 + 1*4*4 + 0*4*3 + 0 + 0*4*1
[I've just dropped out P here, and again, no one will be happy knowing their
going to die.  I'm just assuming life or death is assured.]
So . . .
f(y) = 24
f(n) = 45
Therefore, they should all choose to die rather than kill someone to live.  At
least, if they have these values ranked in this way.  Should someone choose to
kill himself to save the rest?
f(sacrifice) = 1*4*5 + 1*4*4 + 1*3*3 + 0 + 0
[Probably, here the p(H) isn't necessarily 0, but for simplicy let's assume
it's binary]
f(s) = 45
Oh, damn, I miscalculated f(n).  f(n) = 36.  That's what I get for just copying
my notes.

Anyway, of the three options, f(s) seems to be the moral optimum.

[by the way, I think all this is probably bullshit, but it's interesting
bullshit]

our full potential as individuals.  It's a little difficult to really explain
what 'connection' means in this case (I think it's one of those things where
the knowing is mostly in the doing), but as a pragmatic thing there are
considered to be 8 attributes of connection which are a little easier to talk
about.  It's thought (based on observation/experience with many people) that
these attributes will show up in anyone who has strong connection, and if
all these attributes are present, it suggests that a person has strong
connection(s).

The attributes are as follows:
1. Inner Happiness (also described as happiness of a child)
2. Vitality (full of electricity/energy)
3. A commitment to mentoring/community ("paying it forward")
4. Empathy and respect for nature
5. Being truly helpful - living fully in the gifts you have to offer others
6. Full aliveness - being fully present in the moment; awareness of mortality
7. Love and forgiveness (for self and others)
8. Quiet mind - related to presence and creativity

I've found this model useful for reflection and growth in my own life. However,
I also recognize that in the Christianity I grew up with, there was the fruit
of the spirit.  "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance,
kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control."  In terms
I'm more likely to use now, I think these fruit of the spirit are another way
of talking/thinking about how connection will show up in practice.

I suspect many belief systems have some understanding of what it means to be
fully engaged/connected as humans.  The way it's described will vary, but I
think there's probably an underlying human experience these different
approaches are trying to understand/describe.  With that as my starting point,
I don't find it that useful to evaluate and accept or reject beliefs directly,
especially on the basis of materialistic/scientific truth.  Instead, I am more
inclined to observe the fruit of their beliefs (to go back to language more
in keeping with my Christian upbringing).  Even then, if it seems like there
is a lack of connection I might be able to help with, belief (or rather,
trying to change it) is not likely to be the first thing I approach.

While thinking about this, I've had some thoughts about the problems I have
with a strict materialistic approach, at least as it's often expressed (in my
experience).  The problem is that the approach to relationship (and connection)
that has come along with the materialistic approach has been problematic.
No doubt others have talked about this (I think maybe Martin Buber's I-thou
vs. I-it relationships), but I'm not well-read enough to be able to refer to
them capably, so I'll offer my own thoughts on the matter (however much less
profound they are likely to be).

An animistic view might see all things in the world with individual unique
spirits (and collections of individuals with an over-arching spirit as well,
perhaps).  Each individual (with spirit) can (perhaps will) have a relationship
with the other spirits nearby (in some sense - not necessarily strictly
physical).  Each of these relationships is going to be unique (and special)
because it arises out of the interaction of two unique spirits.  As humans, we
are capable of feeling this connection in a deep and profound way.  I might
add that even if there is no such thing as spirit, it seems clear that most
(maybe all) humans can experience something that *feels like* connection with
another being.  Regardless of what's really going on, I think that feeling is
an important one where our ability to make good decisions for ourselves,
those who we share the planet with, and those who will come after us.

Where I think the strict materialistic approach goes wrong is in the way it
has encouraged us to de-personalize the world.  No longer are there unique
spirits that we can connect with.  Instead we are a collection of
fundamentally indistinguishable bits of matter (quarks, atoms, molecules, etc.)
In an attempt to be as objective as possible, we come to view the other
entities we interact with in the world as objects that we (imagined to be
objects ourselves, perhaps) can manipulate, but any connection we might imagine
we feel is not really anything more than a figment of our minds (which in turn
are just another collection of anonymous particles in the form of neurons and
neurotransmitters doing their thing).  I want to be clear that I'm not trying
to say this view of things is a necessary component of a materialistic world
view, I'm merely offering that it's my impression of how it tends to occur in
practice at this time.

I think that humans crave a deeply felt/experienced connection to the world
around us.  I suspect most of us experience it to at least some degree,
primarily with other humans, but even outside our own species, most typically
seen in relationships with pets.  I think when our understanding of the world
does not support the truth and/or subjective value of such connections, we
will have problems.

I think the craving for connection may be part of what drives the inconsistent
beliefs JL has been talking about.  People instinctively want connection (and
I think this desire goes beyond simply being comforted) and will hold on to
beliefs that they feel help them have that connection.  For example, religious
views help people feel connected to each other in the present as well as those
who came before.  I suspect that some of what JL is observing and seeing
as inconsistency may be people accepting the explanatory power of the current
scientific-materialistic approach, but also seeing little or no support for
the connection they crave to other beings and/or something greater than
themselves.  (Which, again, I don't see as something that must be lacking in
a strict materialistic view of the world, but I think it's reasonable to say
that there is little or no explicit support.)

You don't reject colors now, do you? You believe color exists?
And why is that, even though you don't experience color?
Because many of your OTHER experiences are consistent with color existing. If
you were to deny the existence of color, I could ask you questions about your
OWN experiences that would lead you to conclude that color exists, and you just
can't recognize it.
It's possible that you could construct a great alternate theory to color, and
none of my arguments would be convincing. If I couldn't find a compelling
contradiction in your beliefs or inconsistency with your own observations, then
I would probably accept that your view of the world is as equally valid as
mine, and until we had more information, we would be justified in picking
either one.
I would gladly give up my theory of color if you could show me convincing
evidence that your theory explained my own experiences and observations better
than my theory of color.

Now, I currently don't believe in mystical things like ghosts, etc. But if you
could show me evidence or observations from my own experiences that contradict
this belief, I would be compelled to change my belief. And I would be very open
to doing so. But, so far no one has done that for me. And it's not just that I
reject evidence, but I look at it critically and I find flaws in the reasoning
or contradictions in the ideas.

It's certainly not that I don't want to believe in ghosts, or spirits, etc. I
am fascinated with the ideas of these things, but I just can't shake the fact
that no explanation of them is as consistent with my observations and
experiences as a more scientific view that comes to different conclusions.


Now... about your beliefs... I really do believe that if we were to dig into
logical arguments in detail, that I could draw out inconsistencies in your
beliefs. Perhaps you say "If X then Y" but I show you an example of X from your
own experience, where there is no Y. I would break down their beliefs idea by
idea until I believe you couldn't possibly hold the belief anymore without
being riddled with inconstencies. I would try to convince you that an alternate
explanation would not have such inconsistencies, and therefore would be a
better explanation for your own observations. The KEY is that you need to be
exposed to the right information and/or experiences so you can realize the
inconsistencies. Unless you are exposed to the right information, you may not
be able to realize the inconsistencies in your ideas.

Please realize - this is all in theory. I don't *know* if I could create a
convincing argument for you that would change your view on tarot cards, or
spirits, etc. Perhaps I could not. Perhaps your ideas would be *more*
convincing. But the PROCESS of challenging beliefs and testing them against
alternate beliefs is what is important. Being open to that process, and
constantly challenging your ideas to arrive at the best conclusions.


Now... why should you? Good question. I suppose because I assume it will make
you happier, because it makes ME happier. My brain likes that. I often make the
mistake in thinking that other people think like me, which I've learned is
wrong.

A few years ago, I was in a long debate with a Christian about their faith, and
I was trying to convince them why their beliefs were wrong. And at one point,
he said, "So what's your intent? To crush my beliefs? To take away the thing
that gives me comfort in this world? That helps me cope with my mother's death,
and keeps me from going insane? And then what's left? Your view of the world,
which I don't even understand? So you take away my view of the world, but can't
replace it with your own, because my brain doesn't work that way. So how am I
better off? Haven't you just ruined me? Is that your intent?"
(paraphrased, obviously)

That stuck with me. I don't try to convince people of anything anymore. Except
in here, of course, where I assume the whole point is that we all want to
challenge our beliefs and refine our thinking.

I'm not trying to convince anybody of anything either, which is why it's so odd
to me that when you talk about whether colors exist, you talk about me
convincing you that they don't exist. I'm starting from a very different
premise, you see. I don't experience colors. I think my big experiences of
colors are the order in traffic, but please note I ONLY know that involves
colors because other people TELL me they do, and sighted people talking about
colors.

Now, these are the big common experiences. There's certainly other stuff, like
the scientific explanation that red is what we perceive when we perceive
wavelengths between X and Y angstroms. But again, this is trust. See, you're
coming at this like "OK he says colors don't exist, well here's a whole bunch
of shit he has to explain to us then"! I'm coming at it from "colors don't
exist to me, except insofar as I know other people SAY they exist, they have
definitions for them, and so on".

But people have definitions for a pegasus. Or unicorns. Hell you even talk
about pink invisible ones. Clearly you have SOME idea of what the properties
"pink" and "invisible" apply to, I mean, you're not going "well it could be
what we normally call a breadbox, or a spiky hunk of metal, or ..." That
doesn't mean invisible pink unicorns exist, as you've pointed out repeatedly.
So why do I agree there are colors?

Because I trust people, basically. I have faith in them. I'm assuming the rest
of y'all don't lie to me, because the blind are a fairly small minority, and
making up something that elaborate just to bullshit a vanishingly small
minority of the population would be, let's be honest here, pretty damn
peculiar. Of course colors also have some consistency, but that's really no
guarantee of truth. I could say for instance that if we're creating words,
every vowel must be separated by a consonant. That's true of some languages,
but certainly not English, and even if it were true of no language on earth, I
could certainly construct such an arrangement, obviously.

I haven't even gotten into the fun anthropologists have had with color terms,
googling color terms should turn up stuff for you. But essentially, I think
what we've found out is that, though everybody can perceive colors, i.e.
everybody's eyes work the same way, there are cultures that have just two color
terms, and if a culture has more, three or four or whatever, there are patterns
for what terms they have. But I'm pretty sure those people were/are interested
in accurately experiencing/reflecting their world. That's the kind of stuff
that really fascinates me.

I just finished reading "The Mind's I" last night. It's a very interesting
compilation of essays and thought experiments about cognitive science,

found to be a kind of interesting and unique take on things.

"Fiction"
by Robert Nozick

I am a fictional character. However, you would be in error to smile smugly,
feeling ontologically superior. For you are a fictional character too. All my
readers are except one who is, properly, not reader but author.
I am a fictional character; this is not, however, a work of fiction, no more so
than any other work you've ever read. It is not a modernist work that
self-consciously says it's a work of fiction, nor one even more tricky that
denies its fictional status. We all are familiar with such works and know how
to deal with them, how to frame them so that nothing the author says-nothing
the first person voices even in an afterword or in something headed "author's
note"-can convince us that anyone is speaking seriously, non-fictionally in his
own first person.

All the more severe is my own problem of informing you that this very piece you
are reading is a work of non-fiction, yet we are fictional characters,
nevertheless. Within this world of fiction we inhabit, this writing is
non-fictional, although in a wider sense, encased as it is in a work of
fiction, it too can only be a fiction.
Think of our world as a novel in which you yourself are a character. Is there
any way to tell what our author is like? Perhaps. If this is a work in which
the author expresses himself, we can draw inferences about his facets, while
noting that each such inference we draw will be written by him. And if he
writes that we find a particular inference plausible or vali who are we to
argue?

One sacred scripture in the novel we inhabit says that the author our universe
created things merely by speaking, by saying "Let there ..." The only thing
mere speaking can create, we know, is a story, a pla an epic poem, a fiction.
Where we live is created by and in words: uni-verse.

Recall what is known as the problem of evil: why does a good treat allow evil
in the world, evil he knows of and can prevent? However, when an author
includes monstrous deeds-pain and suffering-in his work does this cast any
special doubt upon his goodness? Is an author callous who puts his characters
through hardships? Not if the characters do n suffer them really. But don't
they? Wasn't Hamlet's father really killed (Or was he merely hiding to see how
Hamlet would respond?) Lear really was cast adrift-he didn't just dream this.
Macbeth, on the other hand did not see a real dagger. But these characters
aren't real and never were so there was no suffering outside of the world of
the work, no real suffering in the author's own world, and so in his creating,
the author was no cruel. (Yet why is it cruel only when he creates suffering in
his own world Would it be perfectly all right for lago to create misery in our
world

"What!" you say, "we don't really undergo suffering? Why it's as re to us as
Oedipus' is to him." Precisely as real. "But can't' you prove that you really
exist?" If Shakespeare had Hamlet say "I think, therefore I am, would that
prove to us that Hamlet exists? Should it prove that to Hamlet and if so what
is such a proof worth? Could not any proof be written into a work of fiction
and be presented by one of the characters, perhaps on named "Descartes"? (Such
a character should worry less that he's dreaming, more that he's dreamed.)

Often, people discover anomalies in the world, facts that just don jibe. The
deeper dug, the more puzzles found-far-fetched coincidences dangling facts-on
these feed conspiracy and assassination buffs. That number of hours spent
probing into anything might produce anomalies however, if reality is not as
coherent as we thought, if it is not real. Are we simply discovering the limits
of the details the author worked out? Bu who is discovering this? The author
who writes our discoveries knows them himself. Perhaps he now is preparing to
correct them. Do we live, in galley proofs in the process of being corrected?
Are we living in a first draft?
My tendency, I admit, is to want to revolt, to conspire along with the rest of
you to overthrow our author or to make our positions more equal, at least, to
hide some portion of our lives from him-to gain a little breathing space. Yet
these words I write he reads, my secret thoughts and modulations of feeling he
knows and records, my Jamesian author.

But does he control it all? Or does our author, through writing, learn about
his characters and from them? Is he surprised by what he finds us doing and
thinking? When we feel we freely think or act on our own, is this merely a
description he has written in for us, or does he find it to be true of us, his
characters, and therefore write it? Does our leeway and privacy reside in this,
that there are some implications of his work that he hasn't yet worked out,
some things he has not thought of which nevertheless are true in the world he
has created, so that there are actions and thoughts of ours that elude his ken?
(Must we therefore speak in code?) Or is he only ignorant of what we would do
or say in some other circumstances, so that our independence lies only in the
subjunctive realm?

Does this way madness lie? Or enlightenment?

Our author, we know, is outside our realm, yet he may not be free of our
problems. Does he wonder too whether he is a character in a work of fiction,
whether his writing our universe is a play within a play? Does he have me write
this work and especially this very paragraph in order to express his own
concerns?
It would be nice for us if our author too is a fictional character and this
fictional world he made describes (that being no coincidence) the actual world
inhabited by his author, the one who created him. We then would be fictional
characters who, unbeknownst to our own author although not to his, correspond
to real people. (Is that why we are so true to life?)

Must there be a top-floor somewhere, a world that itself is not created in
someone else's fiction? Or can the hierarchy go on infinitely? Are circles
excluded, even quite narrow ones where a character of one world creates another
fictional world wherein a character creates the first world? Might the circle
get narrower, still?
Various theories have described our world as less real than another, even as an
illusion. The idea of our having this inferior ontological status takes some
getting used to, however. It may help if we approach our situation as literary
critics and ask the genre of our universe, whether tragedy, farce, or
theater-of-the-absurd? What is the plot line, and which act are we in?

Still, our status may bring some compensations, as, for example, that we live
on even after we die, preserved permanently in the work of fiction. Or if not
permanently, at least for as long as our book lasts. May we hope to inhabit an
enduring masterpiece rather than a quickly remaindered book?
Moreover, though in some sense it might be false, in another wouldn't it be
true for Hamlet to say, "I am Shakespeare"? What do Macbeth, Banquo, Desdemona,
and Prospero have in common? The consciousness of the one author, Shakespeare,
which underlies and infuses each of them. (So too, there is the brotherhood of
man.) Playing on the intricacy both of our ontological status and of the first
person reflexive pronoun, each of us too may truly say, "I am the author."

Note From the Author

Suppose I now tell you that the preceding was a work of fiction an the "I"
didn't refer to me, the author, but to a first person character. 0 suppose I
tell you that it was not a work of fiction but a playful, and so of course
serious, philosophical essay by me, Robert Nozick, (Not the Robert Nozick named
as author at the beginning of this work-he ma be, for all we know, another
literary persona-but the one who attended P.S. 165.) How would your response to
this whole work differ depending on which I say, supposing you were willing, as
you won't be, simply to accept my statement?

May I decide which to say, fiction or philosophical essay, only now, as I
finish writing this, and how will that decision affect the character of what
already was set down previously? May I postpone the decision further, perhaps
until after you have read this, fixing its status and genre only then?

Perhaps God has not decided yet whether he has created, in this world, a
fictional world or a real one. Is the Day of Judgment the day he will decide?
Yet what additional thing depends upon which way he decides-what would either
decision add to our situation or subtract from it?

And which decision do you hope for?

Dec 31, 2012 16:52 from Steppenwolf
I find that difficult too, but I nevertheless think it's correct. Otherwise,
you find yourself in the situation where information is absolute--that letters,
for example, are _inherently_ meaningful. That the electrical signature that
corresponds to what I'm writing means that and only the words I'm writing...
even though the words I'm writing are themselves obscure in meaning.
[Physics And Math> msg #35511 (0 remaining)] Read cmd ->

Does there need to be a single inherent meaning? I'm thinking of things like
sculpture, somebody really famous said this, or so I've heard, but I can't
remember who, basically something to the effect that they look at a block of
marble and remove all the things that aren't the sculpture. Or think of clay,
if you have a blob, you can flatten it into a sheet, or roll it into a rod, or
make it into a ball, or make a bowl out of it. But it's like most of the
creation myths, but we'll take the Greeks to be simple. That's chaos isn't it?

All that stuff's POTENTIALLY around, but something has to happen to make it.
But I mean, I can only do what I can with it. I can't make the clay into steel,
for instance. Any shape I make has to be inherently in the clay in some sense,
doesn't it? For me that's one of the big things I get out of creation myths. I
need to really study it to be sure, but it's my contention that "creation ex
nihilo" doesn't really happen. That is, as a category of creation myth, it's a
mistake. ALL the creation myths I've seen, or most that I can remember, start
with SOMETHING. And the idea is, all this stuff comes out of other stuff. The
gods or what have you produce the ordered universe, or not as the case may be,
but the universe we find ourselves in today.

Digging through the Geneology of Religion blog, I found a pretty interesting
post on Krauss, the physicist I've talked about who did the book on why there's
something from nothing book. He agrees with both me and Jl, weirdly enough.
With me, because he admits it's turtles all the way down, and Jl, because
anything physicists say is teh awesome, and anything theists say comes out of
their laziness. I didn't read the linked posts yet, but the one at the end,
where a philosopher responds to his condemnation of philosophy was pretty
interesting. Even though I disagree with a lot of Krauss' comments, I'm glad to

The brief summary, because nobody's interested in rehashing this I'm sure, is
that yes, some of them do. In particular, an objection to "God" as an answer to
"where'd it all come from?", is that isn't "an answer", because we supposedly
then NEED to ask "whence God"? As I've said before, whence X, or as krauss puts
it "why why why", in an infinite regression, is, so far as I can tell, a
problem for ALL causal chains. In other words, end wherever you like, "God", a
singularity, quantum vacuum, fifteen universes before ours, in a supposedly
eternal multiverse structure, like an annoying two year old, I can just go
"why"? And I'm equally justified, or unjustified depending on your views on the
question of infinite regress, no matter WHAT object/cause happens to terminate
any particular chain we happen to be examining.

  The orange color is clearly from mixing red tomato and white coconut milk.
  And cream. The paprika is insignificant in terms of coloring the overall
  dish. There's no turmeric, except maybe what's in the garam masala.

  similar. It has been modified from a Brasilian recipe and adopted over time

I have to chuckle though, at the notion of taking advice on Indian fare from a
Brit bloke.  While I recognize and approve Oliver's efforts in the food
revolution, I would never look to him for zinging up Asian cuisine.  I've
always understood things like butter chicken, jhalfireze or tikka masala to be
made from scraps of miscellaneous chicken leftovers people don't want to throw,
usually from tandoori.  There may be contributions from the creamier elements
but the coconut milk doesn't sound familiar, and it won't be so overpowering as
to change its identity.  Stroganoff is something I associate as odiously
western, to be found in a school cafetaria with way too much cornstarch, unless
of course you make it yourself.

The two shouldn't remotely resemble each other.

Brasilian Stroganoff vs Tikka Masala


http://welovechicken.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/BrazilianChickenStroganoff.

  Ours looks slightly different, as we add a LOT more spices and things to it,
  the default is rather plain (brasilians are NOT known for their flavorful
  foods, they have almost zero spicy dishes and in general stick with salt,
  and the italian herbs. Hell, my in-laws think Pepper is SPICY!)

Well, yeah; salmonella, campylobacter, clostridia, etc. If the chicken has been
slaughtered and handled/stored correctly, the risk is just about zero. But
guaranteeing that the stuff you buy in the supermarket hasn't sat at room
temperature at some point in time is impossible. So, eating chicken that hasn't
been thoroughly cooked tempts fate.

That said, the way I cook it is almost invariably in the crock pot; the
temperature ramps up slowly, and by the time the liquid is boiling, the center
can still be 145-155. Provided the flesh has not been penetrated (blade,
temperature probe, etc.) and contaminated, it should be sterile; my main
concern is that the exterior has been well-cooked.

Red meat is much safer in this regard- and is even considered fashionable when
undercooked (tartare, or "steak waved in front of a candle"-cooked). A few
individuals I know have experimented with "high" meat, and none have gotten ill
from it to date.

The temperatures recommended for some products (pork in particular) are high
enough as to render the meat chewy and dry. I know they dropped the temperature
for pork recently, but it's still undesirably high.

That said, I've been preparing it in this fashion for almost 5 years now, and
have yet to get sick from it. I don't recommend it, but it works for me.

Well, the temperature restriction regarding pork were largely due to

production, I thought, though there's still some (albeit minimal) concern with
wild pork in some settings?  That's probably why the temperature drop for pork.
Agreed though; those temps were (and still are) high enough to make it much
less palatable.  One of the reasons I eat even less pork than other meats.

Speaking of rare steaks, I am finding it hard to get an answer to this:  Is it,
or is it not, safe to serve tuna steaks that are pink in the middle?  I asked a
butcher, and he said "If they're sashimi quality, then you can eat them raw."
But then I asked another butcher who said "There's no such thing as 'sashimi
quality,' that's just a bullshit term they use at Whole Foods to jack up the
price."  If that's the case, it seems I should just be able to buy myself a a
frozen tuna steak at TJs and pop it on the grill, which would make my life so
much tastier.

I know, the cost benefit analysis of a proper delicious nicoise salad vs.
doctors picking worms out of my spleen is a no-brainer, esp. since I tend to be
"There's no chicken worth three days of explosive puking."  But nice pink tuna
steaks are almost worth the risk, an if I knew the risk was low, I'd be all
over that.

(I"m more concerned with worms than bacteria, btw.  Fish thaws so damn fast
that bacteria isn't as much a concern with it as it is with chicken)

there is no official regulation from any governmental agency regarding sushi

The problem is, you can go somewhere and have someone tell you, sure this is
sashimi grade, and not mean anything, or you can have someone say, yeah, this
is sashimi grade, meaning that the fish has been frozen and stored at a
particular temperature (i want to say -7 degrees f for like a week but I can't
remember exactly, feel free to google it).

basically this is the process for killing parasites in fish.
The FDA has ready-to-eat guidelines that reputable places follow, but this
isn't enforced

so both butchers are right :) the term sushi/sashimi grade has meaning if
you're buying from somewhere reputable, but no there's no such official label.

if you're getting ready-to-eat raw fish or sushi/sashimi grade raw fish from
somewhere reputable, seared tuna "should" be safe and IMO is the proper way to
eat tuna

Super tasters are absolutely real.  It's not about being picky, though, it's
about flavors (particularly bitter, and sweet to some degree) being

water, then placing the zip lock bag with the meat on the pan with heat. I
think I was told to add a little water to the zip lock bag so that it steams
the meat, so it is not dry. I have a couple of chicken breasts I want to reheat
tonight, and looking for the best way.

I think the best way to jumpstart the heating process for any leftover meat
(esp if it's grilled, or dryly prepped) is to put it out on the counter till
it's room temp.  That way when you microwave it the rest of the way you won't
end up overcooking it.

Be careful of the dishwasher cooking.  Mythbusters played with it and
discovered the pretty typical model they got doesn't hit temps required for
safe meat cooking.  So they cooked the meat in advance and let the dishwasher

It's safer to pitch it than try to eat it. Most likely, assuming everything was
clean an unfouled, it could be okay if you reheat it to 165-170 degrees. But,
some bacteria (like staph) may form toxins which are heat-resistant, and you

While I think some of my tastes have matured as I've grown older (like everyone
else), I also think I've discovered better cooking techniques that bring out
more flavor. We had a lot of steaming and such when I was a kid, and boiling.
Tossing a vegetable with some olive oil and salt or fresh cracked pepper or
mustard was unheard of. DOn't you know there's alt and fat in that? :) And
roasting veggies just wasn't done. Or if it was it wasn't done well - carrots
were still nearly raw inside, etc. I hated brussel sprouts then - steamed.
Bleh! I love roasted brussel sprouts now, especially when they've been tossed
with a bit of whole grain mustard and oil and roasted nicely. I have to think
more flavorful techniques would have opened up my liking of some veggies more.
That being said, my sister and I always marveled at how my grandmother could
make canned corn taste so good. We'd see it ont he stove cooking in that bit of
liquid in th epot and it was soooo delicious! Better than anybody else's canned
corn. Only as an adult did we learn it wasn't canned, but simply frozen corn.
With a stick of butter. Mmmm! :)

I think a few people have suggested this, more of less, but I often make
roasted root vegetables.  My little kids love it.  A mix of sweet potatoes,
maybe winter squash, carrots, red potatoes, etc.  A little onion or green
pepper for flavor.  Dice everything the same size, roughly 3/4" chunks works
well.  Toss with a bit of oilive oil and some herbs -- whatever you have, fresh
or dried. ROsemary, oregano, thyme, sage all work well.  Roast in the oven at
about 400 for 30-60 minutes until they are tender and starting to caramelize a
bit.  Stir occassionally.

I also make "apple pie squash", which my kids devour.  Roughly the same
technique, but use butternut squash and firm apples.  Toss with butter and
spices -- I use apple pie or pumpkin pie spice, or any mix of cinnamon, nutmeg,
etc.  Maybe a bit of brown sugar. Delicious.  You want the bits to stay
relatively dry, otherwise the squash gets pretty mushy (i.e., don't add water!)

To keep things hot, you can get (from Target, etc.) a casserole carrier -- it's
a 9x13 pyrex pan, plus an insulated carrying bag.  Also comes with a heat/ice
pack that you can heat up and slip inside to keep everything hot.

I find that some spices do not survive tough baking such as when roasting
vegetables, so I add more seasoning late in the bake.  For example, garlic and
ginger seem to lose their bite. Rosemary and thyme smell fantastic, but their
flavor weakens significantly during the bake.  On the other hand, black
pepper, cumin and coriander seem to hold up fine, and some things, such as red
bell peppers or soy sauce get really strong (and salty) the longer they bake.

Ketchup request sends Subway worker over the edge

http://now.msn.com/lawrence-ordone-a-subway-employee-starts-fight-with-
customer-over-ketchup-request

One Subway restaurant seems to have added knuckle sandwiches to its menu.
Customer Luis Martinez says he ordered a Philly steak sandwich at one Florida
franchise, asking for "American cheese, onions and ketchup." Sandwich artist
Lawrence Ordone took serious offense to the ketchup request, ridiculing the
man's condiment craving before knocking a chair to the side and offering
Martinez a side order of ass-kicking. "I said, 'Let's go, fight me like a
man,'" Ordone admits. Unsurprisingly, Ordone was fired. "You can go buy your
own ketchup, and I promise to God, you can put as much as you want on it," he
said. Or you could just eat at a different restaurant.

Considering it's Florida, you're probably all not asking the right questions. 
Was the customer wearing a hoodie?  Was the Subway employee "standing his

In other words... why is anyone surprised about stories of insane violence

I managed a Subway and it is indeed an optional item, at least at the time of
my managment almost two decades ago... :)

But our store had tartar sauce, because we also happened to server fried fish
during lent. it came precooked and all we did was heat it in the thing. I
remember one July some old drunken carny fuck asked for a sub with everything
on it. After several minutes of surly shitty behavior get got everything -
including that rancic sauce which had not been touched in a few months.

Also - remember subway used to have those potato fries things that they would
heat up after you ordered em. Those did come with ketchup if you wanted.

Seriously tho, I had one customer threaten to have me killed because I wouldn't
honor her 2 month expired coupon. I side with this guy, fuck the customer!

Oh and my favorite fast food story...

I was standing in line at Burger King waiting to order lunch. It takes longer
than usual but in about 10 minutes I'm like 3 people away from making my order.
I see a guy come up to the counter and get the cashiers attention.

"Excuse me, you put pickles on this."
"Did you see me leave this line? No. I didn't fucking put anything on your
burger."

He then walked in back and 10-20 seconds later I see him out in the parking lot
walking to the bus stop. Nobody in back seems to have noticed either. He just
walked out and went home. I waited a few more minutes just to see if anyone
would notice and when they didn't, I left.

I saw him working there a few weeks later.

Subway is Doctor's Associates Inc.

They don't actually make sammitches. They sell rights and do inspections.

So you want to own a Subway store. You pay for the right to use their brand,
buy their interiors and blueprints, to get trained by them, and do things in
the ways they say they should be done.

So you want to sell meat to a Subway store. You pay for the right to have your
pre-approved producted distributed to the Subway stores.

Stores have to follow rules for about 98% of what a store does. They can't use
whatver wallpaper they want. They have to use pre-approved equipment. They have
to honor national coupons (and not necessarily local coupons from another
store) - and all of this is inspected, usually, monthly.

But they get leeway with adding items to the menu. Like I said our store had
fish sandwiches. Some stores use Boca veggie patties, some another brand, some
none at all.

Much also depends on the severity of the cut.  If it's multi-layer and just a
layer is cut, pr if it's just a scratch (so to speak) it may never peel, and
would likely be okay.  Watch how it behaves, and while it's just a bit joining
the chorus, don't eat any peeled bits. (We know, you get that now :) And likely
already knew).

If he isn't willing to respect her as a parent, then he doesn't get time with
the kiddo.  Simple.

No one is going to tell me what to do and disrespect me with regards to my own
child.  I've had to remind my mom a couple times over the last few years that I
was my daughters parent and that I was aware of what was going on and that it
was with my permission, or I was dealing with it, or whatever it was.  It's

Nothing here. Yeah, I'm kind of unwilling to put up with my dad's crap if he
decides to inflict it on my son. And honestly, I don't really see him
developing any new skills on the front of dealing with others with conflicting
views, and he's this "I'm the authority and you have to respect me" type (with
"respect" really meaning "fear my wrath"), so I just don't know how things will
go in the longer term.
-
He's never had an employee that he liked, he's never had a colleague he's
liked, he has only a couple friends and isn't on equal footing in a way with
either, so he's still always in the "authority" mode rather than actual
"friend" mode. There's a part of me that just feels really sad for him on all
he's missed out on with me, with so many people in his life. But the pity kind
of gets trampled on when he then tries to tell me wha tto do, says things about
my life or whatever that show zero understanding that I'm not him.
-
The biggest problem I have -- and the real source of any anger that's left in
me about this -- is that he and my mom both talk all the time about what great
parents they are and how dumb/inept/etc. other people/parents are, and how
great I turned out because they're so awesome. Mind you, I left home at 17 and
never missed them for even a day. (I speak to my mom often, but never have
actually *missed* them. Not once.) It is SO incredibly hard to listen to them
focus on how great they think they are and take all the credit for who I am
when in reality, I got myself where I am with hard work and rejiggering my
entire way of thinking.
-
Anyhow ... Apparently I needed to get that vent off my chest just now, but no,
there's no risk of me exposing my son to anyone, related to me or otherwise,
who treats me, my husband or my child without respect. I was actually scared to
have kids for a long time because I was afraid I'd risk hurting a child like my
dad did me, and I had to get to a point where I knew that wouldn't be the case
before I'd even consider it. Thanks again for everyone's thoughts. It's helped

See, in terms of grandparents doing what you want them to do in regards to your
kid - I don't think it's necessarily a black/white issue.  I'm not referring to
Nothing's situation in particular, just generally.  I think it's important for
kids to realize that different households have different rules and that you
have to obey those rules (within reason) when you are a guest in that house. 
They key is, of course, that those rules are reasonable and not totally off the
wall.  And that they respect that parents as well.  But my grandparents were
allowed to punish me if I disrespected their house rules, even if those rules
were different from my parents' house rules.  My parents explained ahead of
time what my grandparents' rules were, and that was that.  We disobey, we get
punished.

What sorts of checks and balances are there to groups like al-anon?

I have a very dear friend that told me they want to make her a group leader,
and I'm honestly completely baffled why she would be asked. She's far from
healed (but maybe you don't have to be healed to lead?)... But I would think
more importantly the fact- she isn't following any sort of healing path.

She's currently lying to her family and closest friends, she's continuing to
live in a house with her alcoholic/drug/gambling addicted husband, she's dating
a man that is a former (and possibly current) alcoholic, she's sneaking/lying a
lot to date this man. Every close friend or family member that's she's trusted
to have meet this boyfriend doesn't like him.

She joined al-anon about 10 years ago... And in that same amount of time she
has completely changed as a person. She never used to isolate herself like she
does now. She's very lonely. She's somehow manipulating the al-anon teachings
to justify the way she's livign her life.

From what I've seen, there are essentially no checks and balances on who can be
a sponsor in the Anonymous groups.  I'm not 100% sure what a Group Leader is,
but sponsorship (where a recovering addict asks someone with a greater length
of time sober/abstinent to work with him/her more intensely, maybe with daily
check-in phone calls, etc.) is a very informal process, at least in the
Anonymous groups I used to attend.  It's not as if they give you a badge and
say you can be a sponsor.  Since nobody there is officially sanctioned as a
therapist (unless they're a therapist in "real life", that is), and it's all
voluntary, it has to be pretty informal.

Thanks for the responses on the al anon... I'm really surprised that my gf, who
is so damaged and totally manipulating the program to suit her needs is getting
promoted to teach others.

Her closest sister, her oldest friend, and myself are completely at a loss and
really starting to get fed up... And of course at the same time we're worried
about her safety. The sneaking the boyfriend into her bedroom at night w/ her
cokehead husband 15ft away is going to earn her physical harm if he catches
them. Its only a matter of time before she gets caught... And with that man SO
closeby, well, its urgent.

When I posted here, it was prompted by a discussion we had... The thought was
to use al anon to intervene and shut down her lying/manipulating. But I'm
guessing by the responses here that al anon really doesn't want to get into it
with their members?

The other problem is we can't get her entire family on board to stop this- her
husband can't know about the boyfriend (for her safety), and her kids can't
know about the boyfriend (obviously because if they know, the info can get to
their dad/her husband and again, safety issue).


Has anyone here ever had success with helping a friend/family member that's
putting themselves in a mess like this? How'd ya do it?

Call me Petty.

I'm married and have four children and have never had a shower thrown for me.
I've never asked why I didn't get a shower for my wedding, I'm assuming it's
because it was a small wedding and not a lot of people got invited. As for the
babies, I had my first before I met my husband and my friends tried to throw me
a shower, but the timing was bad and it ended up being on the day he was born,
so I didn't get to attend. My MIL was going to throw me one for my second
child, but he was born right before Christmas and she planned to do the shower
in February. Everybody I know gave him a gift for Christmas, so I felt weird
about having a shower after that and I don't think she had gotten very far on
planning it so it was scrapped. I'm not hurting for stuff, it's not that I
wanted a lot of presents, but it's the idea of celebrating that person. Why was
I not worth celebrating?

Anyway, it usually doesn't bother me, I don't go around pouting because I
didn't get a shower, but yesterday my MIL told me that my SIL and my future SIL
are both getting 3 showers each, one of which will be combined, but still. Part
of me thought I didn't get a shower because I didn't marry into the
shower-giving type, but apparently that's not the case. So now I'm down, really
down, I cried for about 1/2 an hour this morning before getting up and I keep
thinking about it.

This is petty. Nothing I can do now will get me a shower then. How can I get
over it?

Petty,
Agree with Pookie, it's not petty to have hurt feelings, but IMO the hurt
feelings aren't about the shower, but the perceived hurt your MIL has caused
you.

My advice (note: I usually take my wife's advice as she generally is right, so
take this with a grain of salt) is that real heart-to-heart conversation has a
better chance of healing wounds and solving problems than anytihng else.

If there is any way you can talk to your MIL without getting aggressive and
without her getting defensive, you might gain her perspective - and seeing
things from outside of yourself is, in my experience, the best way to let go of
the hurt.

I can totally see how you might feel hurt given the situation as you've
described it.  I hope you can find some peace.

didn't think his drug issue was that big, never seen him toot more than 3-4

in front of him. He does drink quite a bit, not every night, but when he starts
he won't stop until every drop is gone.

Yeah, the bitch fucking BIT him. Boggles my mind. He had serious medical
consequences from the bite, his arm was black for over a month from the
bruising and then infection (she broke the skin).

He was actually asking me about the sex addict thing and had been reading a lot
of commentary on Tiger Woods and was hearing a lot of himself I guess. He asked
me to print some stuff off the internet on that too, hopefully I'll have some

So I liked drumm's idea, pick any group and use the 12 stepping to work on the
whole mess. Hopefully he'll pick a local meeting, I don't really want to be
driving him to east bumblefuck to save his pride.


Oh, one last question... I guess I should call ahead on the meetings I saw
onlines, I'm not sure what "closed" and "open" means on them and there's a lot
of abbreviations and stuff. There's tons of meetings for all 3 groups within 25
miles and I'm not sure how to narrow them down. I'm not going to sit in the car
freezing my arse off through the whole meeting, and I have no intention to quit
drinking or anything, so I'd need to find a meeting I could sit inside and keep
my mouth shut at, while he learns whatever he's gonna.

Closed means that only addicts/alcoholics are at that meeting, open means that
anyone can come to the meeting--if you're going for support, you'll want to go
to an open meeting so you don't have to wait in the car. Growing up I've heard
a lot of the differences between the AA meetings and NA meetings locally, they
are very similar, but people can get attached to one group or the other and
they don't always think highly of the other group. He may be best off going to
some of all of them to find out which group dynamics would help him out the
most, as the regulars may benefit him in one group over another. If he needs
help, though, the best thing may be for him to get to any meeting as soon as he
can just to get help. They can provide more information if he asks. BUT, please
remember that if you're doing this for him, he won't recover until he's ready,
it can't be you, it has to be him. It breaks my heart, but a lot of people come
before they're ready and they relapse. That doesn't mean they shouldn't come,
you get what you're supposed to at every meeting you go to (even if you're just
there so you're not out in the car), but as a non-addict I've sometimes had a
hard time meeting people who come for a bit and then I learn that they've
relapsed.

are many alcoholics who get sober in AA and then realize that they've turned to

OA or NA and then also in Al-Anon, the group for friends/family of addicts.

I was rereading your posts and got to thinking - if you friend is the one with
questions and concerns, why isn't HE the one gathering up this information?
How come he has brought it to you and why are you doing the leg work?

It might be really beneficial for him to actually go out and find this
information on his own.  My impression in your two posts is that you may be
enabling him a bit?

Also, multiple addictions really does sound like a pretty big problem and
profesional therapy of one type or another in conjunction with a 12-step group
will be very helpful.

In my experience people come and go from 12-steppers pretty easily.

I recently went to a psychiatrist after years of relying on my primary
care physician to help me with depression, using various
antidepressants including Wellbutrin and SSRI's, with "meh" results,
but better than not taking them (not taking them really fucked me).

It was like "I can feel kinda shitty on antidepressants, or really
shitty on nothing at all."

So my psychiatrist wants to move towards treating me using mood
stabilizers instead of antidepressants.  Mood stabilizers are what you
use for bipolar.  The idea being, if one thing isn't working why not
try a different thing?

Anyway, I thought this was kind of odd, cause I definitely don't have
Bipolar I or II by DSM-IV criteria.  But I happened upon a book in a
bookstore called _Why Am I Still Depressed?_ that makes a good case
that while Bipolar I is a pretty distinct thing, there is a spectrum
of Bipolar II, where one end is difficult to distinguish from Plain
Old Depression, and a lot of depression may be this kind of Bipolar II
misdiagnosed.

Thinking about this I realize that a lot of things about my life
during less-depressed times could be interpreted as very mild symptoms
of mania, and some things that have gone wrong with me in the past
year (where my mental health has been shakier than usual), that have
gone along with my depression but sure not seemed like ordinary
depression, scream "dysphoric mania."  (I.e. spending a couple days
barely able to restrain myself from constant anger at everyone and
everything).

So maybe I'm "kind of bipolar" after all instead of plain old
depressed, and maybe lamyctal will help me where SSRIs just keep me
from falling too far.

Anybody else had experience with this kind of ambiguity (Major
Depression vs Bipolar II)?

My only suggestion is to make sure your Psych. knows what dosages you were
taking of previous drugs before ruling them out.  The Psych my wife went to
after a similar experience of "meh" results with several drugs took a look at
what the primary care doc had prescribed and realized that the doc was
prescribing the minimum effective dose (per drug company literature).
Unfortunatly, the concensus among Psychiatrists was that a proper theraputic
dose was 150 -225mg instead of the 75mg her primary was giving her.  Which I
only brin

bring up because apparently the psych said that was a pretty common problem
with primary care docs when treating psychiatric disorders.  Since side effects
are common with the drugs, they tend to go with the minimum dose even when the
result is equally minimal.

To add another opinion here, I have taken Celexa, Lexapro, Prozac and Zoloft
for depression with "meh" effects at best, over the course of maybe 12 years.
Actual negative effects from some of them, including just kind of a blotting
out of whole years of my life and also flattened affect.  And there were
periods in there where I didn't take anything; some of those periods were okay,
some were hellish.

Since I was developing some anxiety symptoms a few years ago, my doctor put me
on Effexor.  If they ever take Effexor off the market, I am screwed.  It really
feels like Effexor makes some connection in my brain that is not being made
otherwise.  Since I've been on it, my marriage and sex life have improved, I
have more friends, I've gotten a promotion, blah, blah, blah.  I really feel
like it makes it possible for me to live a fuller life without
depression/anxiety hanging over me all the time.  The only downside is that I
get the brain zaps when I don't take it on time.

The point is, you may want to try a couple of other drugs before you give up on
SSRIs.  I know, trying sometimes involves 2-3 months of misery.  For me, to
find Effexor, it was worth it, because I was miserable already.

Effexor has a very short half-life (4 hours and 11 hours for the drug and its
active metabolite).  So it's easy to go into "withdrawal" from it, even by
missing say 2 doses.

With Effexor as with many SSRIs with short half-lives, some people experience a
withdrawal syndrome that includes these brain zaps and other withdrawal
symptoms.  I guess it's called SSRI discontinuation syndrome, and there's
something on Wikipedia about it:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSRI_discontinuation_syndrome

It's kind of a weird dizziness feeling when you turn your head, like your eyes
become disconnected from what your brain is asking them to do somehow.  That's
how it feels for me anyway.

But not everyone will experience it, and if you take your meds on time and,
when you decide to get off of them, do it slowly and with your doctor's
guidance, it's not a big deal.  Just feels bizarre.

Bipolar Bear here.

Saw the doc again.  She confirmed she was indeed treating me for
bipolar; she's apparently cagey about telling someone right away that
that's what she's doing because a lot of people think of "bipolar" as
an "extreme" diagnosis (based on stereotypes about Bipolar I), and she
doesn't want to freak people out the first time they see her.

I've had some ups and downs but overall I think the Lamictal is doing
me a hell of a lot of good.  Angry times still happen but they're
getting very rare, and when it starts happening I can catch myself and
say "people aren't really doing things to piss me off, that's a
symptom, that's inside me" and that helps.

Now that I'm *on* the Lamictal, i'm going *off* antidepressants, one
at a time, carefully.  (I was on two, before, wellbutrin and effexor,
the latter being itself having replaced the very similar pristiq).

It's been kind of a rough week going off effexor but it's getting better.

The remarkable thing is that suddenly after a long time I'm able to
engage myself in creative, artistic pursuits I used to, years ago, but
had ceased to have the will to do anymore.

That's really really cool.

I think this is a good thing.  I think there's something to this
Bipolar II diagnosis.

I'm not sure why I'm writing this, maybe it's for catharsis, I really don't
know, but due to the nature of the investigation, there's no where else on the
'Net I can write about this. If you are my friend, this may give a little
reason why I've been so quiet lately.

This first part might be TMI for most people as it discussing miscarriage. If
you aren't comfortable reading about it, please skip to the next paragraph.

This first item is not related to the main item, but is still incredibly
hurtful, and it all happened in the same week. Late last week I had thought
that I could have been pregnant, I had gone to the doctor, and low and behold,
I was. My husband and I were overjoyed. They wanted me to come back on Tuesday
for a dating ultrasound. The news was not good. Long story short, I should have
been 8 weeks pregnant. The baby stopped developing at 5 weeks. So, now I'm
waiting for a miscarriage.

My husband's boss was a really great guy. He was the one who announced to the
company that our baby had been born in 2007, we had been to his house a few
times, he had taken us out to lunch shortly after my husband and I got married,
he gave us some really nice furniture because he was downsizing, just an
all-around nice guy. He worked with my husbandd in the same cube for 11 years,
ever since Steve first got on with the company. He said to my husband, "Have a
great holiday weekend!" Steve said, "Yeah same to you, man.. have a great one
and see you Tuesday." Tuesday will never arrive for him.

Late last night, our neighbor who is a manager for the same company, left a
rather subdued message on our answering machine, all he said was he needed to
talk with Steve that evening. Well, we made contact and our neighbor came over.
This guy appeared to be in shock when he came to our door. I thought he just
had business to talk with Steve and I left them alone and went to our bedroom.
A few minutes later, Steve came into the room and said, "You know that there
was a plane crash at Airman Acres (a small grass strip centered around a
residential airpark). Honey, [Steve's boss] and his mom were in that plane.
They're both dead. My jaw dropped and I felt my blood go cold, and I got dizzy
all in one second. Not only were we going to lose a baby, but now our friend
had died in a gruesome accident. You can get the details of what happened here.

http://www.kjrh.com/dpp/news/local_news/2-killed-in-plane-crash-near-Collinsvil
le-ews-original-kjrh-20100529

When your live centers around aviation, it's extremely heartbreaking. I'm third
generation pilot (still working on it). Our friend had been flying for many
years, and we will only know what really happpened when the FAA/NTSB makes up
their final report. All we have are hypothesis.

We drove out to the crash scene today, the cockpit is totally gone. Beyong
recognition of what anything is. The news reports said that he and his mom died
on impact and I see why. The plane's wing hit the ground first, spun the plane
around, and the crew cabin exploded immediately. If internal injuries didn't
kill them, the first would have. The news reports they were dead on impact. The
tail is fine, one of the wings is fine, but the crew cabin is totally burned
out.

It really just started to "be real" for my husband and I. We both cried and
held each other for several minutes, and all we could say is "Oh God, Oh God,
WHY?!" We stopped holding each other when we saw a man approach. He allowed us
to get beyond the barbwire fence and as long as we stayed out of the
investigation tape, we could be there for a few minutes. I took every
conceivable picture I could. After a few minutes of talking with locals, we had
to go home. Still, both Steve and I are in a daze, and in absolute shock. Going
up to the accident site hurt and helped. It was hard seeing where our friend
died, but it all became real to us that this had happened.

I'm not sure why but Steve wanted to remove all the pics from the cam
immediately. We were warned by someone up there to not let those pics get out.
The way he said it he sounded angry with Steve and I, although he was the one
who helped up get through the barbed wire to get to the plane. So I have no
idea why. We were being respectful and told him we were friends with the pilot.
I apologized so profusely but thanked him for letting us see the plane.

My husband has these pics on the computer in the "protected area' and he says
that he's thinking of deleting them. I told him that keep there were they were
and don't delete them until he's talked with me.

I know I've written too much but this has beem a shitty week all around. Sorry
I haven't been able to identify by name the pilot but there's still an
investigation going on, they can't release his name because he's not been
positively ID'd. The ME is waiting on dental records for positive ID. But we
know beyond a shadow of a doubt that's him.

One of the saddest things we saw today was when we were driving by the hangar,
and we saw his beloved Porsche that he used to drive up there on Saturday. Just
extremely sad this whole week, the miscarriage was bad enough, but to have our
friend killed... I just have no words. He did pass away doing what he did best,
but it doesn't help those who are left and who are mourning his life.

I can't say this is one of the weeks of our lives, because undoubtedly
something will come along to make it even worse. And we are so sad enough. I'm
crying again, can't keep going, but I passed on what to say for now, but I may
need to post again soon. Thank you for your suggestions on getting us through
this tragedy.

Supposedly, grandparents were babying him.

-I see her -- while not doing the *exact* same things she says the grandparents

-As a friend, I would like to help her realize how her actions may not be

Based on the above, I have two questions:

-How much, as a friend, am I supposed to try to 'smack some sense' into my
friend? I'm not belligerent, but she is completely blind to her actions and
only views her actions separately, instead of as part of a collective issue.

This current issue (how she dotes on him), affects our friendship as she has to
sacrifice time and comfort from our friendship in order to maintain this new
and seemingly counter-productive situation with her son.

It'd be like if you had a friend who said they couldn't hang out as much
because they needed to save their money to buy a new car that's more eco-
friendly; however, they tell you that they're buying a Hummer; you try to tell
them that that's not 'eco-friendly'; they get a Hummer anyway, and now they
have to take a second job in order to afford all of the other costs associated
with it, so you two will be spending even less time together. I imagine that
would tick you off as a friend.

My mom lost a friend she's had for over 30 years because she couldn't keep her
mouth shut about how her friend is managing certain relationships in her life.
The past couple years the friendship was so strained with arguments until the
friendship basically ended (they naturally share common friends, so they're
cordial to eachother, but that's it). Her gf has been married for almost 30
years and has had a bf on the side for almost 20 years. Her gf is also failing
to give a good motherly kick to her kids. My mom wasn't wrong in her opinions.
I share them. She lost her friendship because she gave unsolicited advice and
didn't communicate well or respectfully with her friend. I've maintained a
relationship with her (former) best friend, the woman was almost like a aunt to
me, now that I'm an adult she's more like a cousin or sister in our
relationship.

She and I talk, but I don't overstep my bounds. I don't get to tell my friends
how to raise their kids. If she asks, I'll give her my input. If she's bitching
about the kid, I'll ask permission before I offer any suggestions about how to
handle the situation. etc. Its about HOW you communicate with your friend and
being a good enough friend to accept the fact that they might not accept your
suggestions.

"Its about HOW you communicate with your friend and being a good enough friend

Yes. I perfectly agree.

However, I'm not trying to tell her *how* to raise her kids. I'm trying to get
her to realize how the method she chooses is only mimicing what she says she
*doesn't* want to occur at granny's.

Fictional scenario:

-You're a health nut. Your friend -- while not a health nut -- does okay. One
day, they find out that they are at risk for cancer due to radiation exposure
at work. They decide to quit their job and take up smoking instead. You ask
them why'd they quit their job, and they respond "Because I don't want to get
cancer. *puff* *puff*."

Now, in that situation, I'm not trying to tell them 'smoking is bad for you,
you should be exercising, McDonalds is the devil, go jogging'. But, it's enough
that what you're doing is unhealthy, that you do it on *top* of being
paradoxical is a bit much for me. Then, add to that that I can't stand
cigarette smoke...

I'm only going by the facts that are present. I'm not judging the person. I'm
making observations how current actions don't match stated goals and how said
actions also affect me (and invariably us).

If your only goal is to spend more time with your friend, then you need to
focus on this relationship. I really think you're trying to split hairs, "I
don't want to tell you how to raise the kid, BUT you're doing blahblahblah" is
a horrible type of conversation to have.

Rather, tell her how happy you are to see her developing a new relationship
with her kid, offer to be her sounding board, and in the same conversation tell
her you miss the friendship you had before she started working so hard on her
relationship with her son. Ask her if she feels the same way, if there's a way
you two can hang out more, maybe do different activities together (moms of 19
year olds are often free at odd hours, for a while I was meeting my gf for
coffee before work in the morning because there really was no other time in her
day to hang out). Its a more passive approach I think it will also open her up
to more of a conversation rather than a defensive (if she's even open to a
conversation with you about her kid- she might not be, some people don't
involve non-family in family issues)

Tempestas> Thanks for that well-formed advice. That's what I need to hear.

At this point, I've taken to simply distancing myself from her because the
situation is so awkward and I'm always biting my tongue (ie: the son has his
own room, but he lives in the living room - LITERALLY- playing video games and
sleeping, which means that any time I come over, her and I are quarantined to
the bedroom, which is a lot smaller and TV-less.)

She talks about how he has no direction and is not growing into an adult, but:

-she pays his bills

-he stays there free

-he has no job

-he has his own room -- which she cleaned for him after having moved half of
his stuff there... which she in turn sorted through to help discard any trash-
- but he has free reign of the living room. I mean, he eats, sleeps, and lives
in the living room 24/7.

-he recently asked if he could have a friend come for a visit... which means
that the friend will now be occupying the living room while the son goes to
what is essentially his sapre bedroom.

She *removed* him from his grandparents because they were always giving him
money and gifts and what not and not helping him to grow. So, when I come over
and witness all of the above, on top of having to stay in the bedroom and us
essentially having less time together because she'll of course need
parent/child time, it's aggravating.

As a friend, I'd like to help her achieve her goal(s). However, that I can't
have an effect on such without seeming to overstep my bounds just causes me to
retreat to my own apartment and wish her the best.

Maybe the next time she brings up how he has no direction and isn't growing
into an adult, bring up those four points.  Ask her what she considers and
adult to be, add a few things you consider an adult to be if she doesn't bring
up any of your points.  Then say to her, if you want him to have direction,
he's going to have a need to have direction, and she has to create that need by
not doing it all for him, so he needs to work and pay his bills and rent.  And
he needs to respect her while doing that all, so he should move into the
bedroom and treat the livingroom as a shared space.

care about her and the only reason you're saying this is because you want what
she wants - for her son to be a grown up.  Then back off entirely.  Let her
take some time to digest what you've said.  If she takes some of your advice,

A few days ago I had posted about the private plane crash that killed 2 people,
Steve's boss and his mother. The family is having a private cremation for the
family, but Scott's home is being opened up for a reception for FlightSafety
people. Physically I feel sick with the baby (who has not passed), but I am
going to this reception to support my husband and for myself.

Question: Why has Scott's death affected me so much? We met a few times
socially and had a good time, but it's not like I sat at the same cube with him
for 11 years (cubes are two to a person). I can think back in my mind about
people I've socialized with and whom ended up dying under tragic circumstances,
but Scott's death has really hit me hard. All three of us are heavily into
aviation, maybe that's it, but doesn't really explain it. *sigh* I'm just a

A death of a friend or acquaintance can affect people strongly sometimes.  I
think a lot of how you feel about this has to do with where you are in your
life right now.  You have a lot going on, plain and simple.  You are in the
thick of dealing with your own miscarriage.  Feelings are transferrable.  And I
hate it when people blame a pregnant woman's emotions on hormones, but I'm
pretty sure those are at play here too.
Let yourself feel the way you feel.  It's valid.  You are grieving for a lot

I wanted to thank you all for your support during this time, and wanted to give
you all some udate here. For some reason I'm having trouble with spontaneous
logoffs so we'll see how much I have the patience for and I'm not used to C&P
every paragraph I write.

I guess you would say that the miscarriage part of this is probably over, but
not by a long shot physically. My heart is still grieving for this baby, who
wasn't discovered until 8 weeks but stopped developing at 5w. We've been trying
for two years now, including fertility treatments last fall, so it's an
additional heartache that we had it, but not for long.

There will be a memorial service for Scott on Tuesday at 3PM (Central, if that
matters). Since Scott's mom didn't want a service, I guess that was assumed of
Scott, too. Scott's family did open up his home last week but I guess that was
the most as far as a memorial went. And not all people were invited either,
these were only for people who were from the company or had close ties (namely
spouses and children - OK< one child, ours, who was well behaved. :)

The memorial is being planned by the person who was least thought of by the
family, Scott's GF of 9 years, Secora. She's the one that my heart goes out to
most because she was treated as person non grata by the family, which made me
feel really badly fof her. I know she must be hurting so badly at the moment.
She had been widowed before she met Scott. My hurt aches for her.

Steve and I went for a drive tonight and it must have been leftover pregnancy
hormones combined with plain grief, we talked mostly about Scott about 3 hours.
I know he is hurting, too. I asked him the hypothetical question of "Why is
this affecting me so much?" He said, "Well, he was an extension of family. Plus
the aviation factor doesn't help." I've been in aviation my whole life. I've
known people to die in an incident, but never this close. I mean, you have a
greater chance of getting killed in an accident on the way to the airport than
you do in the air, both privately and commercially. But when YOU'RE that ONE
(or two in this crash), it doesn't matter if an A-380 (the new-ish double
decker by Airbus) went down. The person you cared for is gone. Poor analogy,
forgive me. I'm still a mess.

The initial NTSB report came out about the crash. It was so difficult reading
about your friend's final seconds on Earth, and if he had just done one thing,
he'd be alive today..But the final report is not in yet, and we just don't know
if he could have been able to do that one action. It looked like he tried to
turn back to the airport after the engine stalled. If the engine is stalled you
have no power. Once you start a turn, you don't have power to get out of that
turn and he hit wing first. If he had maintained "straight and level", he and
his mom might have sustained serious injuries, he may not have anything left
reusable on the plane, but he would have been alive. But for now, we just don't
know what happened.

My heart just aches and I'm still crying so much. If I'm in this shape, I'm not
sure if I'll go to the memorial service.... who's knows at anything at this
point.

Thank you for reading.  Your thoughts and prayers and appreciated.

I have fought so many battles in my life. I don't know how much fight I have
left in me. I just have trouble hanging in there. I am alone in this world
right now in my life and what a fucked up world it is. I have fought through
beint molested.... still fighting that battle... I have fought through my son
dieing at birth... I am fighting through a divorce and being told I am a
horrible father.. Yes I have my faults I have had issues with gambling so I
went to GA and got myself banned at all the casinos within driving distance. I
got hooked on pain meds due to migraines. I went to NA which helped. But the
soon to be ex slept around over 20 guys is in a relationship and trying to put
him in the dad role. I shell out my 1000+ a month in child support even though
it has not gone through the courts yet. I am an ATM after a 10 year
relationship and almost 7 years of marriage before we seperated. And before I
moved out she was fucking guys with me and the kids in the house. But the
seperation is all my fault. I go to my therapist on a regular basis and on
medication.. its just tough hanging in there. It's hard to be the whipping
post of the ex. There is no one close by any more that I can lean on she has
tainted them all. and everyone else is so far away. Work dulls the pain its a
distraction. Until I realize I am alone in that building surrounded by people
with lives and families. I go home to an appartment and am all alone. I have
nothing left that is not been taken from me or being taken from me. I struggle
though I just dont know how. I don't know when I will crack. I know I am about
to crack. I just don't know how I will crack. I go to church and sit and pray.
Yet my faith fades. My hope is fading as well. I keep searching though for that
light. That little glimmer of hope. Yet it hides in the shadows. I know I can
not continue down this path because it is dangerous. I don't know if this is
the beginng of the end or a new beginning. If it is a new beginning. I need to
find that light fast. I know I am tredding on thin ice.Yet I ramble on.

Well, my wife just told me that she wants a divorce.  Now, we have been
seperated for 3 years, but for the last 6-8 months have been talking about
reconciling.

The funny thing is, I'm not even sure how I feel about it.  We have a son, and
we've been married for 11 years, but he's only 6, so he doesn't even really
remember when we lived together.

During the separation, we spent a pretty fair amount of time together, so I saw
my son probably 5 days a week (he stays with me 3-4 days).  I'm definatly not
keen on the idea of not getting to see him for 4-5 days in a row twice a month.
But at the same time, if I'm not married to her, and we aren't contemplating a
reconciliation, I don't know that I really want to be around her more than
necessary for kid swapping and planning.

I think there are still some feelings for her, but she's done a pretty good job
of either killing them, or forcing me to lock them pretty deep down to protect
myself. (Affair, longterm)  So to be really honest, it's possible that what
feelings I can find are more a love of habit and comfort rather than her.

I do know that I'm afraid of being lonely.  I have absolutly no idea how to
date.  (not that I have an immediate interest)  She was my first and last date
at 17, married at 22.  I do at least know what I would go looking for this time
around (and what to stay the hell away from).  But the idea of it is daunting.


To be honest, I know this is rambling, I hven't really had time to put anything
together coherently.  There are a couple of areas I could use suggestions in
though.

The separation, and the divorce will defintaly be civil.  But seems to feel
that my past patience and consideration particularly with money and our son
will continue and that we can continue to be friends.  (ie: Sure I can leave
work early to pick up Mason on your day; sure I can give you some of the
support money early to help cover your bills; sure you can call me for support
when work is tough and you feel overwhelmed)  But the thoughts I have when
considering such things now are:

Fuck No I'm not taking time off work on a day when you have our son to take him
to a doctors appointment because you didn't realize you had a meeting when you
scheduled it.

Fuck no I'm not going to sit here and listen to you bitch about being exhausted
from work because you insist on letting the boy sleep in your bed and he keeps
you up at night.  Deal with it yourself.

I put myself out for family and close friends.  You've decided you no longer
wish to be my spouse, I'm not going to continue devoting energy to your
wellbeing.

Obviously the problem with this is that these sorts of things impact my son as
well, so that always has to be a consideration.  But I know she's going to end
up using the fact that it's our son to elicit my cooperation.

Problem is that I don't want to be as much a doormat as I was, but I don't want
to sour our relationship to the point that we end up contentious about the kid.
And I know, even if she doesn't, that she doesn't currently have the resources
to effectivly manage her life.  (I'm sure she'll manage eventually)

I will admit a certain perverse joy in watching her struggle (and fail) in
managing some of the aspects of her life that she long criticized me for
failing to manage well.  Particularly in the area of money.  After years of her
bitching at me whenever a bill was paid late (either because I forgot, or was
stretching money), she has overdrawn to the tune of like $500 in fees in the
last year and hasn't paid her student loan in 4 months.  But then suggests that
we go out for dinner after our son's school open house.

Anyway, to those few who actually managed to read this far, I apologize, I know
it was rambling and hard to follow.  But I needed to discuss it with someone
and my normal outlet is no longer availible.

Almost single>  First, my condolences on the loss of your marriage.  It is a
loss, and you need to take time to grieve.  Don't worry about dating or any of
that nonsense.  First you have to find your you again.  You've been part of a
couple, a 'we' for some 16 years.  You need to take some time to figure out who
you, as a single man, are, what you want, what your priorities are, etc.

IMO, your first priority has to be taking care of yourself.  If you don't take
care of yourself, you will find yourself in no condition to take care of anyone
else.  Yes, your son should absolutely be high on your priority list.  But
unless you look out for yourself first, you won't be able to look out for him.

You have to decide what level of "friendship" you're comfortable with, with
your wife.  With my first husband, we've had absolutely no contact since the
day he violated a restraining order then hopped a bus across the country.  And
for that, I'm extremely grateful.  My second husband is a friend.  We don't
talk daily.  We sometimes vent to each other about family stuff.  Ours is a bit
different situation, as neither of us have custody of our kids.  They live with
my parents, and are healthy, happy, and well cared for there.

But it took some time for us to get to this point where we're friends.  We
first had to get past the pain and the loss of our marriage, and work past the
pain we'd inflicted on each other.  It wasn't always easy.  There were still
huge fights, and months on end where we wouldn't talk at all.

The kid swapping can be as easy or as hard as the two of you make it.  Hubby 2
and I flew back and forth across the country several times a year to swap the
kids back and forth (before they went to live with my parents, obviously),
stayed at each other's places, snuggled and more, treated it like a vacation.
He and his first wife, a whole 'nother story.  They got to the point that kid
swapping could only occur in the presence of a law enforcement officer, or
completely be done by third parties (friends or relatives).

As far as any concessions she may ask (picking up your son on her day, advances
on support, etc.)....that's something you are going to have to decide for
yourself what you're comfortable with.  And then make it absolutely crystal
clear to her.  And put it in writing.  Then stick to it.  Easier said than
done, I know.  Especially if she choses to try to use your son as a weapon.

Definitely see a lawyer as soon as possible.  You may want to do some research
to find one who specializes in fathers' rights.  And you might want to consider
some short term counselling as well.

Or you can drop by my Mail>.....it's always open if you need to talk.  *hugs*

I've never been divorced, but I've had many close friends and family members
who I've watched navigate this process with children.  I'm not going to pretend
that there's an easy answer to your problems or a solution that works well for
everyone.  Every case is different.  There are more grey areas that you will
face ahead than you've probably ever faced before in your life.
Things that I've seen that will help:
1) See a lawyer as soon as you can.  Get your own lawyer, don't share one with
your wife.  Maybe try to find one that is knowledgeable about father's rights
in your state.
2) If you haven't already, separate your finances from hers.  Separate the
legal stuff too - designate new benficiaries on your insurance and other
financial documents, if you have a will or a living will - make the necessary
changes.
3) See a counselor or therapist.  Try to get your soon-to-be-ex to go with you
in order to find a way to work together as co-parents.  If she won't go, see
one on your own.  Your friends and family will thank you, trust me.
4) Tell your friends and family in order of importance and need-to-know basis.
It's hard, but try to be as neutral as possible.
5) Don't think about dating right now.  Please try to get your life together
and get a good schedule worked out before you throw yourself into the dating
scene.  Take this from a woman who has made the mistake of dating recently
divorced men in the past who SWORE that they were emotionally ready to date
again.  Please know yourself and don't get involved in someone's life until the
drama has mellowed out in yours.

I'm not sure that your medical issue doesn't qualify as a disability.  But you

help for those suffering from depression or pain?  It sounds like, on top of
the physical issues, you might be depressed as well.  This is not at all
unusual.  When my mother was suffering from crippling migraines (several times
a week for years), she became withdrawn and depressed.  It took a twofold
approach before she started to feel better, physically and emotionally.  Even
when her medication started to make her feel physically better, she was still
emotionally in pain.
If there is a friend or a family member who can help you make some

If you have a human resources department or a good relationship with your boss,
you might be able to re-arrange your schedule so that you can work from home

Otherwise, I would connect with friends to ask for help with your cleaning and

it depends on your situation, like what state you're in, what city, what your
local laws are regarding asking for help, are you alaska native or part
american indian? i know these areas and how to help with them, depending again,
on where you live.

ok a few suggestions that will help you mabye feel safer. i always feel safer
when my refridgerater and freezer are full. its part of that cutting down on
the anxiety thing. so if you (not pointing at anyone in particular so its a
broad termed you) can get to the food banks they also will havec help with
clothing availabie on certain days. if you have to leave yhour job cos its
become so stressful uyou can't stand it you could apply to social serurity. i
dont know thsee all seem like dumb ideas now that i say them.

and so te get further into possibly causing trouble... have you talked to your
shrinkiedink or pastor, a priest or your hair dresser about what you're
stressed about? i talk to ALL my friends, my shrinkiedink, my
counsilor(spelling aaargh! counselor??? - not the lawyer, the one that helps my
shrinkiedink) *cackles gleefully* so. if none of tghat helps borrow someone
else's kids for the day and go have fun! im sorry, i dont mean to make light of
your situation, its just that wihtout more information i dont know which way to
point. im not very good at pointing.. but im pretty good at making others laugh
so thats what i go for when i can. thanks for your time and hve a nice day.

1. continue working w/ your dr on whatever the problems are
2. If you haven't, get yourself a therapist. You'll have better luck getting an
appt quickly with a non-prescribing therapist rather than waiting 6 weeks or
better for a psychiatrist. You'd only need the psych. if you need a
prescription, but you can get a prescription from any dr, with the advice from
the therapist.
3. Get an appt. with social services and apply for everything, see if any state
assistance can come out of it.
4. Reapply to social services whenever your income changes for the worse, you
may end up re-qualifying.
5. Since you're still at your job, you need to look for social assistance that
does NOT require income verification. This will be church-based foodbanks,
programs like Angel Food Ministries, etc.

Typically, you do need to be pretty destitute to qualify for welfare assistance
programs... But even a homeowner can qualify himself for foodstamps for 6
months. If my memory serves, a CT resident for example, can own a house, have
up to $7k in other assets (vehicle, bank accounts), and still qualify to get
foodstamps. Right now in the pre-destitute phase you're in, there's not much
that's going to prevent you from falling financially in this. So, again, get a
therapist, because you're going to have a lot of emotions to deal with and
you'll need to be talking to someone about it- and it may as well be someone
who might actually be able to help you navigate your situation.

Lastly, you might want to start to prepare for separation from your day job.
Obviously lack of income will be a big problem, but you might have some options
to keep health insurance for yourself. We all know the COBRA is beyond
ridiculously expensive- so you'll want to find an individual policy to buy. I
don't know much about other states, but in CT we have Charter Oak health
plan... This allows CT residents who (a) haven't had health insurance for
6months or more and (b) otherwise don't have access to health insurance to buy
into a group policy. The premiums are cheap and on a sliding scale, so IF the
income is low, a person can qualify for a lower premium.

I know being in pain and depressed, these are the last things you really want
to do for yourself... I hope for your sake you can just plow through and get
what you need.

BPD is weird.  Mental health professionals have a hard time with it, because
what you see with it is a person who is pretty much always fucking with and
manipulating everyone around them.

My impression is that it's very different from sociopathy.  Sociopaths
come across as smooth and charming, and are very in control.  They may
or may not ever get violent or loud or scary, but they do those things
by choice.  They have very little in the way of actual feelings.

BPD people may use emotions to manipulate people, but those are real
emotions; they're full of emotion and every interaction they have with
everybody is emotionally loaded, positively or negatively, and it's
very difficult to deal with them.

Dealing with a sociopath would usually be pleasant and fun until they
decided to use you to get what they wanted and throw you aside.

Dealing with someone with BPD is a constant nightmare for both of you.

*Both* BPD and sociopathic people can be extremely selfish and hurtful
to people around them, manipulating and using them.  Someone who's out
of control and full of emotion sounds BPD'ish to me.  If they were
coldly manipulative under a smiley happy exterior, that'd be more the
sociopath thing.

ALL JUST AMATEUR PSEUDO-DIAGNOSIS OF COURSE, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT

I need some perspective on this one....I'm too close and it hits too close to
home.

A friend is in an abusive marriage.  Her husband has thrown her down the
stairs, hit her, threatened her, threatened their children, has been
threatening to burn down the house then kill himself, screams at her regularly,
all the usual abusive asshole type stuff.  Today he topped himself, chasing her
and their 4 year old around the house with a 2x4 (until he shattered it,
beating it against a wall, creating about 8 holes) and a metal baseball bat
(which he also used to smash the headlights of her car).

The neighbors called the cops when they saw the man wearing nothing but boxers
wielding a baseball bat on the car while threatening to kill everone in the
house (by name), then kill himself, then burn down the house.  She got an
emergency order of protection (has to go to court Monday to get a preliminary
one, then to trial for a real one), and he was cited for simple assault, a
Class 1 Misdemeanor.  He self-committed to a psych hospital, and I believe is
being held for 72 hours as a danger to himself and others.

The 4 year old is safely ensconced with friends in another town.  Their other
child is at Grandma's house and missed all the drama.

My friend is blaming herself for all of it.  Every bit of it.  It's her fault
he went after her.  If she were a better wife, or placated him, he wouldn't
have done it.  If she were a better mother, he wouldn't have felt the need to
threaten the kids.  If she hadn't rented the basement to a friend of theirs,
that friend's and her husband's friendship would still be intact.  (The friend
stepped in between them to protect her from the baseball bat.)  It's not
helping that the nurse she spoke with at the hospital told her that her husband
really needs her support, and she should consider reconciling with her.  Or
that his boss at one job, and his business partner at another are both at the
hospital with him playing "oh, poor you" at him.

It would be one thing if it were "normal" blaming herself.  I could deal with
that, I think.....at least to some extent.  She's doing irrational blaming
herself.  She won't talk to a domestic violence counselor, because they would
blame her.  Obviously the courts think it's her fault too, because otherwise,
they would order him to give her every penny he has.  I don't deal well with
irrational melodrama.

The extra challenge for me is that I'm a DV survivor.  I've been where she is,
and I've felt the guilt and the shame.  I've felt like it was all my fault.  I
never got into everyone else blaming me, though.  And not to the irrational
level of feeling entitled to everything my abuser owned.  I'm fighting
against....not so much flashbacks, as I don't feel like I'm reliving the
experiences.....something more along the lines of emotional flashbacks, I
guess.  Reliving the panic, the fear, the anxiety, the shame, all of that.

So here, denizens o' Support>, is where y'all come in.  How do I help her,
while keeping myself emotionally safe?  I want to help her.  I want to be
supportive.  At the same time, I want to slep her when she gets irrational.
And I want to run away and hide to protect myself from reliving those emotions.
 I saw a professional counselor for several years after my abusive relationship
ended, and generally don't even think about it any more....until all this.

What say you?

"Dear <Friend>, I know how much you need some friendship and support right now.
I know this, because I've been in your shoes.  I know you've been blaming
yourself and feeling guilty.  I felt the same way when I was in a similar
relationship.  I want to be there for you and be supportive of you, but
listening to you blame yourself and hate yourself is hitting a bit close to
home for me.  I don't blame myself anymore for being a victim of dv.  I don't
blame you either.  I don't think you should blame yourself, because I know you
are not at fault for any of this.  I wish you would talk to a counselor, but
that is a choice you will have to make for yourself.  Counseling helped me and
no one there blamed me for what happened to my relationship.  Please know that
I care about you and I don't want anything bad to happen to you.  I want you to
get out of this relationship and feel like the amazing woman I know you are."

Something like that.  My friend was in an abusive relationship as well, and I
wrote something similar to her a long time ago.  She managed to start divorce
proceedings and got a restraining order - but that still didn't stop him from
going after her.  He held her and their children at gunpoint, started a fire
that burned their house down, and shot himself after she was able to get the
kids out of the house.  I know you know how serious this situation is with your
friend, but I think she's still in denial about it.

Kerb here.
I've been a single father for several years, during which time I've dated 2
women. The second left just about a month ago and picked up with a new beau two
days after we called it quits, leading to popular speculation that she was
sowing the seeds of that relationship weeks, maybe months in advance.  She
deliberately stayed away from my daughter and me for months, all the while
claiming love for us, but displaying no willingness to be with us, even though
we lived only 25 minutes apart. Although my daughter knows what the exg did to
us, she still loves her and maintains contact with her. I asked my child to
break off contact with the exg out of respect for me, but that didn't work. Now
my daughter is spending summer in Louisiana with her mother and I hear that the
exg is planning a trip down there to see them. The exg and ex-wife have become
somewhat chummy in recent months, so it's impossible for me to simply cut my
daughter off from the exg.  I've seen text messages from the exg to my
daughter, yet my loving child claims she's had no contact.

I can't think of a single instance in which my child took my side in anything
against anyone. I'm curious to know what would someone have to do to me for her
to take my side. Would someone have to physically beat me to a pulp before she
says "Please don't do that to my Daddy," or even then?

I know it's difficult for you, because you feel wronged in this particular
breakup.  And if your ex-gf did cheat on you, that was wrong.  But you are
hurting right now and you are feeling sensitive.  Your way of dealing with that
is to cut off contact with your ex-gf.  Your daughter had a relationship with
her too that was very, very different than yours.  Therefore, her subsequent
feelings about your ex-gf are going to be different.  She still needs this
woman in her life, as a friend, perhaps.  I don't think your daughter is trying
to hurt you - but as you can tell, you really can't control who she decides to
communicate with (especially if her mother tacitly or explicitly approves).
-
Breakups are messy when kids are involved.  Kids can get way more attached to
your significant other than even you are.  Kids also tend to be more forgiving
than adults sometimes.  Instead of seeing this situation as your daughter
"taking sides against you", try to view it from her perspective.  Your daugher,
through no fault of her own, lost someone close to her.  The breakup was
decided (or whas between) you and your ex-gf - daughter got NO SAY in it.  She
misses the ex-gf desperately.  I'm sure she loves you, but when she saw an
opportunity to forgive the ex-gf and have her back in her life, she took it.
-
Maybe she doesn't know how you feel about the ex.  Maybe she thinks that this
is a similar situation to what happened with her mother, and it's not a big
deal for her to visit the ex.  Or maybe she's pissed at you for some reason.  I
don't know, but you'll have to talk to her about it, in a way that is calm and
rational and doesn't blame her or make her feel guilty for wanting to see your
ex-gf, even if you don't.

How do you folks deal with having dreams in which you have something that you

are way better than your actual less-than-awesome life?

I have a bad back and bad knees which has sort of cut my athletic and fitness
capacity short. This is a large part of who I am/was and have been able to deal
with the gradual losses as they occured. However, I had a dream where I was
chasing somebody. In the dream, the reason I was chasing them was bad (they
stole something or whatever), and I couldn't catch them, but even *in* the
dream I was happy because I was realizing that I was able to run and that my
back and knees didn't hurt and...'WOW! I'M REALLY RUNNING!'

Then, I woke up.

While I say that I have been able to deal with my loss of physical ability, it
has been tough since it's not like I have ever been injured. Stuff
just...started getting defective. So, I started feeling...defective. Or cursed.
Whatever. The point is, having dreams like this which remind me of how awesome
abilities I NO LONGER HAVE are is not fun.

are involved? Should the about-to be abandoned spouse start documenting things
like overheard incriminating conversations, the lack of time the leaving spouse
has spent with the kids since they were born (as in maybe changed 6 diapers,
never gotten them ready for bed, never got them ready for school, doesn't play
with them AT ALL), etc? How much could one expect to get for child support? If
the non-working spouse took a high-paying job in the next few months, would
that jeopardize the child support?

Child support depends on the state in which you file.  You cannot stop your

depending on the state and length of time being married.  YOu may be eligible
for 1/2 the retirement savings as well.

Usually you can talk to an attorney for free for about an hour, where you can

how much child support/alimony you can expect, etc.

if he/she desides to leave anyway, apply for emergency temporary custody so he
 or she can't snatch the kids from you. i can't remember very much more than
that at the moment but if he or she gets violent about it there are family
shelters available. if one ends up there it will open a lot of doors for
getting low income housing or section 8 vouchers. remember no matter what to

Call me Family Money.

I found out recently some of the farm land owned by my family has very valuable
soil and people are interested in purchasing the land. At first I was really
excited abou this, because this means my family would be getting a lot of
money. Well, the land is wrapped up in a complicated trust, and in order to
sell this land, all eight of the grandchildren have to sign an agreement to
break the trust. (I am one of the grandchildren.) At first, I was so excited
about having extra money, I didn't think twice about what was really happening.
But as I've learned more, I've realized the people who are going to buy the
land will be fracking. My mom is so upset about this, she has told my dad she
does not want him to ever discuss it in front of her. He has abided by this.

Each of the siblings  (my father and his sisters) gets to decide how to
distribute the money to their kids. My father has decided that my siblings and
I will receive $14,000 a year for the next 20 years or whatever. I think it's
the most they can give us without us having to pay taxes.

I was so excited about this, but now I'm just feeling kind of yuck about it
when I think about the environmental implications. However, if I don't sign to
break the trust, my siblings and cousins cannot collect any money from this.
So, I really don't want to be the hold out on this. But I was thinking, that I
might write them a letter asking them to consider donating some or all of the
money they make from this to charity. All of my cousins are currently in or
will be soon in lucrative careers. My brother, sister and I have all chosen
social service type jobs that will never be lucrative, but I do hope that when
I get my student loans paid off, I will donate this money to charity.

So my question is, would it be inappropriate to send a letter to my cousins
asking them to consider donating some of the money to charity? I wouldn't
expect them to ever tell me if they did, but I would like to plant the seed in
their head.

I'm not sure why you feel it's ok to tell them what to do with their money. 
I'd be annoyed if another family member came up to me and said "hey, why don't
you donate all of your inheritance".  I think the most you can do is talk about
your plans and how you're happy that you can donate more money now.

I don't see why that would be inappropriate. It's only a suggestion, not a
mandate.

I'm not goign to start any arguments here (not the place), I can understand
your concerns about the environment from the fracking process. But also
consider that the land isn't going to be put to waste. People will be employed
who will make good wages doing good, hard, honest work. Taxes will be levied
from the work done, and the product that is sold, which will beneit local
communities and state government.

You could include a covenant in the sale which requires the company to restore
the land once they're finished with it. You could also include an agreement
that has the company give the land back to the family once it's done so that
you can use it for whatever purpose you wish, to ensure that it doesn't go to
waste. There's lots you can do if you sit down iwth a lawyer and talk about it.

I've been cheating on my wife with someone I've fallen in love with.
She's my best friend, and we've known each other for years and things with my
wife have been up and down and one thing led to another. I'm a complete and
utter asshole. I know. We have a young son too. He's 8 months old. I don't love
my wife anymore. I don't have feelings for her anymore. I've talked
individually to therapists about it, and nothing changes how I feel.  My
relationship with my friend has been amazing. We have been incredibly close
(emotional infidelity for years now for sure) and physical infidelity just in
the past few months. We've "broken" up now. She's dating someone. I'm not
even certain that I can be with her after all this is done, but that said I'm
just not able to be with my wife anymore.  I've talked to different therapists
who have different takes on it. One feels I need to be up front about my
relationship with this other woman and the other feels that if I've chosen to
end my relationship with my wife for reasons other than the other woman my wife
doesn't need to know. I'm not sure which I should go with. The worst part is, I
have gotten so used to bottling up my feelings that my wife has no idea it's
coming. I will not tell my friend. She deserves the freedom to work her
relationship out on her own. Personally I'm a wreck. I haven't slept in days
and it's starting to show in my personality. I'm not even sure where to go with
this. I love my son very much. I make alot more money than my wife and I intend
to financially assist her with child care and the mortgage. Since this is
really my fault, I have no intention of taking her home from her. I admit
that I harbor some amount of hope that I will end up with my friend but I
really have no idea what the future will be.

I'm sorry for sounding judgemental but I agree that there is a lot of selfish
undertones in that message.  Are you looking for us to have sympathy?  Because
clearly there was no question in that post, unless you were so overwhelmed with
guilt that you cheated on your wife and the 'gf' broke up with you and is with
someone else.  I think before you even think of leaving your wife you need to
examine *why* you do not want to be with your wife anymore.  Is it because
things have changed since having a baby?  Do you truly think the grass is
greener on the otherside?  I don't understand how you have spoke to so many
therapist regarding your relationship.  You have actually gone to therapy with
that many therapist in such a short time?  Are you looking for someone to have
sympathy for you?

Do you really want to know why you haven't slept in days?  Because you feel the
GUILT that you cheated on your wife.  Of course you are not going to sleep
after your 'gf' breaks up with you for another person so now you don't have
your mistress to be with.

If you actually want to be able to sleep at night.  You need to tell your wife.
Otherwise you might as well pack your bags and move out now and try and sleep
else where with all that guilt.  Nothing is going to help you sleep at night
except sleeping pills for the guilt you are carrying around.  Best thing is to
come clean with her. Stop and think for a moment how you would feel with being
in her shoes. Yes you might feel like you are sparing her the pain of not
knowing and just divorce her for the simple fact that you just don't feel it
anymore.

Yes I have been cheated on before but my word it was from a druken stupor and
it was admitted to me the very next day.  And to this day that person doesn't
help but have that guilt hanging over head, especially every single time
watching people cheat on TV, as always the guilt comes back.

I'm going to lay off the guilt bandwagon here and just say that sometimes
marriages don't work out.  People make mistakes and people fall in love with
other people.  HOWEVER, I'm glad that you realize that cheating made things
worse, not better for you.  Now you're stuck in a mess of your own making, and
you have to clean it up.
It's situations like this that I use to warn people with when talking about not
getting married unless you really, really love that person (and you're not
really, really in love with someone else).  And obviously, don't bring children
into the mix if you are having doubts about your relationship, duh.
But being that you can't erase the past, you should concentrate on the future.
I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you and your best friend are probably
kaput for good.  And that's not a bad thing.  You guys are not good for each
other - for some reason, your relationship with her leads you both to do
unethical things.  So, she's gotta go from your life, for good.  Find a new
best friend - maybe a male one this time.
You also need to talk to your wife and tell her that you aren't in love with
her anymore.  Maybe you never were.  You're going to have to deal with her hurt
and her anger at being lied to.  She didn't deserve that.  You don't have to
tell her about the cheating, unless you've been practicing unprotected sex with
your girlfriend and your wife.  In that case, she's going to need to get tested
for STDs, and you'll have to tell her.
And you're going to have to see a lawyer to figure out what your paternal
rights are.  Cuz your wife is going to be PISSED and pissed off, cheated on
wives often do irrational things, like try to deny their ex husbands access to
their children.  You might have been a shitty husband, but you sound like a
decent father and these are two separate things.  Make sure you know your
rights.
That's it from me.  Good luck straightening out your life.

This is the fun thing with the internet. You only get bursts of info without
always the whole picture. Short summary is, we've been together for ~20 years.
In that time, our sex life has always been meh. My wife is not very sexual and
doesn't really enjoy sex so we've really never had great sex. It's very
difficult to turn her on, she doesn't want to try new ideas, and most
importantly doesn't communicate what she likes or doesn't like. We have both
cheated on each other physically a handful of times and feel no guilt toward
it in the long run. My guilt isn't that I cheated on her but that I fell in
love with someone else. I suppose that's a form of cheating. I absolutely
don't feel guilty that I had some pretty amazing sex with this girl, but
that's happened before already anyways.  I'd tell her, she'd be a little
irritated for a while and we move on. Which is exactly what happens when she
tells me.  I wasn't clear in my original post that it wasn't the sex part that
I wasn't sure if I should tell her.
As for other reasons, we have had alot of problems in the past. She's very
impatient, doesn't like repeating herself, doesn't like when I repeat myself
if I try to tell her the same thing twice she snaps at me, she doesn't like
my sense of humor, isn't interested in most of the things I'm interested in
and she goes glossy eyed when I talk about them but if I do the same for stuff
she brings up that isn't interesting to me , holy shit,
does she go on a warpath, and really, other than the long history we have as
well as some other things during when we started dating that kept us together
I've wondered how the hell this has gone on so long. So no. This isn't new.
Communication has always been pretty up and down. We can talk about things
and the world around us and whatever pretty well, but as soon as we talk
about each other and we start talking anywhere near critique of anything she
completely shuts down and won't hear it and won't talk for days sometimes.
She's seen a therapist about this and it hasn't really gone anywhere. She still
does the same thing to the same degree. She also takes advice as criticism that
what she is doing is wrong. I'll give you an example, she uses a notepad app
on her phone as a shopping list. I suggested we could go to the app store and
see if there is an actual shopping list app. What does she do? She freaks
out and tells me why can't I be happy with the way she's doing it now and then
wouldn't talk to me for days.  And that's a pretty minor suggestion.
I feel pretty shitty that I didn't come to this 2 years ago before there was a
kid in the mix, but at the same time I don't regret having my son. He's a
beautiful amazing kid. I don't want him to grow up seeing a Mom and Dad that
don't love each other and can't communicate worth shit. I grew up in a house
like that and it sucked.
As for her post partum condition, she's still hot. Her baby fat is gone
Her breasts are as perfect as they were before and she breast fed.
I have no problem with judgmental responses. But since most of you seemed
to have focused immediately on the sexual gratification part but that's really
a tiny part of it.
I think I posted for my own sanity. Nothing like the anonymous interwebs to
sound board what I'm feeling.

Karma Police: Thanks for the input. I think I was looking for some thoughts as
to what I tell her. I'm not worried about diseases, we were safe. I'm also
aware of my parental rights and I know my wife well enough to know that in the
short term I may have to fight to see my kid but in the long term, she knows
it is best that he sees and knows his father.

I'm also going to refrain from judgment, here.  Obviously, you know you're
wrong, this situation is bad, etc.

You've got three choices.

First, you can do nothing, which as you say will lead to your child growing up
in a household where the parents do not like each other.

Second, you can ask for a divorce.  You can say "I am not happy, and I do not
think that you are happy.  We both deserve to be happy, and so does our child.
Can we find a way to separate to give us all the chance at that happiness?" 
When she asks "why," lay out how you feel, not what she did alone.  "You're a
bitch when you're bored" isn't helpful.  "I need to feel some of my interests
are shared, and I don't often get that feeling when we're talking about things
that I find interesting and you don't."  She'll say "Well, you're a boring ass
too!" and you can say "Yes, I know that you're bored by some of the things I
say.  You also probably need to feel that sense of sharing, and aren't getting
it."  This will be a difficult conversation.

The third option is the hardest, and that's the one that requires you to save
your marriage.  This will involve coming clean, asking her to come clean, and
to set some ground rules about sexual gratification outside of marriage, as
well as making it clear that you need a new protocol for communicating your
feelings to each other, because it's not working as it is.  You'll porbably
have to hire a professional to help you with this.

As a person who is facing something similar, Pecc's three things are spot on
but understand that none of them will be easy to do.

Based on what you described, #2 seems to be the right fit for you but that is
just an observation based on very limited information.

As with any relationship, when things start going badly and if people aren't
in the right frame of mind, little things seems to be a lot worse than they are
because we are so focused on the bad that it is all we are looking for
ultimately.

Right now, my wife thinks I had an emotional affair with another woman.  I have
no idea what the heck that means honestly.  I never met her, talked to her some
on the phone, never hid it from my wife, and I never had any feelings for this
woman.  (When I say I never met her, I mean that I never met her in person so I
couldn't tell you what she looked like at all).  The only reason that my wife
blew a gasket about the thing was because this woman's husband calls my wife
and tells my wife I am cheating on her.  So my 15 years of marriage to my wife
got trumped by 15 minutes by some stranger so it has made me wonder a lot on
how great our marriage ever was.  Granted there are a lot of other things but
that was a icing on the cake.

I wish you the best of luck in whatever you decide with your wife and the only
advice I can give you is to look beyond now and ask yourself what you need to
be happy in the future and then follow that.

I just want to say thank you to Peccavimus, Cold Fusion, and Karma Police for
your comments. They are much appreciated and echo the thought process that I
have gone through. What will be most difficult is dealing with my wife's
reactions. I care for her. She has been a good friend throughout our lives
together and this will be a horrible blow to her no matter which decision we
end up taking. We are both caring enough parents that I believe we will be able
to care for our son the best way possible no matter what we do.
For the judgmental people, I also appreciate your comments. I understand this
isn't a simple topic and people's experiences range all over the place.
One thing that is very interesting is that most of my friends are females and
the best of my friends are all women with one exception. Throughout my nearly
4 decades of life, I have had mostly women friends and I have never met
someone that I've had such a strong connection or chemistry with than my "gf".
This is the first time I've felt such a strong emotional bond with someone.
I had a similar feeling to my wife but to a much lesser degree. We were young
when we met, we were our first sexual partners and I think it was easy to get
caught up in a relationship that wasn't horrible because we were both afraid
to be alone and let it go far longer than it should have.
Lesson learned I guess.
Thanks again for the comments, I really appreciate them and I think I'm good

I guess it sort of makes a difference re: you and your wife both having
physical infidelities over the course of your marriage.  In those situations,
if terms of an open relationship haven't been agreed upon ahead of time, I
often think that dangerous emotional situations can occur.  I think if you're
really honest with yourself and your wife, you both will probably admit that
your marriage isn't the greatest and that it should either end or change so
drastically that it will end up nothing like the kind of marriage you share
today.
Also, in light of everything, I think you should tell your wife that you fell
in love with your friend.  If my husband had a one night stand (protected sex)
with a stranger that he'd never see again and was regretful and would never do
it again, I wouldn't want to know.  If my husband had a full on emotional and
physical affair, I would need to know in order to move forward honestly with my
