Yes, 'enable' and 'disable' mean the same thing as 'chkconfig on' and
'chkconfig off' did previously.  You can start and stop services manually with
'start' and 'stop' just as you could with the 'service' command previously.

There really are no gotchas save one:  When you isolate a service (the new way
of switching run-levels), any service that is *not* enabled in the run-level
you are switching to will be stopped.

For example:

You are running X and logged into the console.  You have a database service and
a Java application service you have started manually.  They are not enabled in
the current runlevel (runlevel5.target), but you have started them youself.

You decide you want to use your laptop more and figure you'll shutdown X on
your server so X using any memory or processor.  When you switch the system to
runlevel3.target, because your database service and Java application are not
enabled for runlevel3.target, they will be stopped as you isolate
runlevel3.target.

# systemctl start postgresql.service java_appliation.service
# systemctl status postgresql.service java_application.service
....
blah blah blurb indicating these services ARE running
....
# systemctl isolate runlevel3.target
# systemctl status postgresql.service java_application.service
...
blah blah blurb indicating these services are NOT running
....
#

And so on...

The work around is to enable the services, switch run-levels, and then disable
them again:

# systemctl start postgresql.service java_application.service
# systemctl status postgresql.service java_application.service
....
blah blah blurb indicating these services ARE running
....
# systemctl enable postgresql.service java_application.service
# systemctl isolate runlevel3.target
# systemctl disable postgresql.service java_application.service
# systemctl status postgresql.service java_application.service
....
blah blah blurb indicating these servers are STILL running
....
#

And so on...

What I really don't like though is the way the .service file is basically like

instead, if you need complicated behavior, you need to effectively create
multiple service items or use as separate script.

well to be fair, svcadm has like 4 commands with varying syntax, and it puts
them in like /usr/lib/svc/manifest and /usr/var/svc/something/something.
So you have the svc xml config file, in a totally different spot then the
actual command to start the service. If you make a change to the xml file
you have to reload it, then if they update it, they overwrite your changes.
Or mysteriously, all the services you turned off come back on.

I haven't played with systemd enough, but i am assuming it is at least
that arcane.

My thinkpad has the following options in the bios
optimus
integrated graphics
discrete graphics.

if you choose integrated graphics, it actually disables the discrete nvidia
graphics.
if you choose discrete it disables integrated.

so if you don't need the nvidia graphics, you'd pick integrated.  however i use
windows for games, so i pick optimus

the trick is, under linux, the optimus mode has the card "enabled" but not
booted up properly. this is where bbswitch comes in. it disables the nvidia
crd.

the M4600s i've seen only provides optimus/discrete as the option no integrated
if you do have integrated, pick that, and see if your battery life goes up.
if you don't have integrated as an option, you'll need to enable optimus, then
use bbswitch to disable the card.

I might get a fedora vm going (or maybe put it on an sd card for my pi) just to

Right tool, for the right job.  That said, if you want a reasonable linux
desktop with reasonably new desktop-ish features, you NEED to be somewhat
bleeding edge on Linux.  And that's where fedora comes in quite well.

If you don't care about those things, sure, don't go Fedora.
But if you want those things, Fedora's one of the better choices out there.

CentOS is a godsend if you need to support RHEL and don't feel like dealing
with RHEL licensing issues. Not just cost, but the freedom. I.T. can build
CentOS VMs and installations without blinking.  IMO, the most incredible
feature of CentOS is that it is binary-compatible with RHEL. In this world
where RHEL is typically the only approved Linux distro in production (not for
any valid reason), you can support RHEL without ever actually running RHEL.
That's pretty damn useful.

It seems odd to me that people would switch to OS X this late in the game.
Anyone who has been paying attention has noticed that OS X is becoming
decidedly unfriendly as the Apple machine moves it from being a desktop OS to a
mobile OS.  The "last great release" was Snow Leopard, before everything fell
apart starting in Lion.

I doubt my next home machine will be a Mac, despite having switched to OS X
during the Public Beta days. (Prior to that I was mainly using a NeXT and
a Solaris box running E).

At this point, I'd really like an alternative.  I see Bad Things(tm) in all
directions. Of course, it might be that I'm just getting old and can't
"appreciate" systemd's claws getting into everything and uprooting bits
that really don't need to be disturbed. (I'm confused at the cries of
"separation!" that besieged ZFS from the Linux community to watch it
embrace a design that clearly doesn't.)

I had to switch to OSX because of some Mac-only software that I needed, and
that keeping myself with Windows as my main OS meant win8, which I outright
refuse. Linux is, and has been my main OS for everything else since 1998,but
stuff to do some work (Office, mostly) is a Windows or OSX-only thing. So the
only option that would keep me Windows free and let me do most of my work was
OSX.

That said, both MS and Apple seem to be on a race of "who rapes the consumer
most" as MS is going the same way as Apple ("secure boot", the draconian WinRT
settings, the copycat draconian MS appstore) and well, win8 is also moving its
os from desktop OS to mobile OS, and in fact they might have taken that jump
even further than Apple.

Linux *was* pretty good as a stable Desktop system, but the dick move for mass
obfuscation has been very dissappointing.

Ethernet interfaces.. The new naming convention is actually less obfuscated
than previously. At least it matches the hardware now. Still, you have to know
the hardware, it doesn't give you the ability to tag a device with a logical
name.

Systemd... yeah, it seems like a lateral move to me. Scripts are in a
different dir, and the config syntax is different. I don't know what the gain
is. Except user-specified daemons. That's useful. But they could have easily
done that in init.d/ scripts, too.

Systemd (as I understand) was primarily introduced because of the lack of
dependencies in the /etc/init.d system.  It was becoming very very hard to
build a reliable boot sequence when you don't know what device will be availabl
e, when.  E.g. booting off of a usb disk, networking interfaces coming up after
things that need them, etcetera.

I ran into two myself, which are now happily gone (although I'm not sure if
it's due to systemd):

- automatically mounting a usb disk wouldn't work
- network interfaces coming up late on certain HP hardware

I think the concept of systemd is probably not that bad, what I don't
understand is hiding the actuall scripts from the users (only found out where
they are these days a few weeks ago, thanks to isca) and changing them into
desktop-like files instead of actual scripts.   The latter was the beauty of
the init.d system, I think.

the second was someone else's response
they're both interesting read and lennart's comments in the second url are
actually pretty good.

i think one of the things people need to get their heads wrapped around is that
systemd is NOT JUST an init replacement.  It's an entire infrastructure.
There's alot of things systemd does that sysvinit can't do and would need
significant changes to support additional components to provide much of the
systemd functionality.  I can understand why the entire thing was replaced as a
whole because of this.

that said, Lennart can be a fucking egotistical asshole yes.

I REALLY REALLY like the new fedora ethernet interface naming mechanism. It
still doesn't make it any easier to identify which physical port is which
interface, but hey, baby steps :)

Would you expand on that, why systemd isn't just an init replacement?  When I
think of init, I think of the whole package, scripts and all, to bring up and
tear down different logical states of the system.

For example, I can see EXplicit dependency tracking being useful. sysvinit
used IMplicit dependency information in its numbering system (S02crond,
K01crond, etc.) But I can also see explicit dependency tracking being brittle
and rife with problems, just as it is in package management systems.

so i think of init as process ID 1 started by the kernel as the first boot
process.  and thus is reponsible for kicking off and managing the run-up
process.

systemd has that functionality, but it also adds infrastructure for
responding to d-bus messages, a whole bunch of extra "event" handling features
for triggering services/actions based on events that occur (mount'ing, etc
etc).  udev has been merged into systemd so that /dev nodes can be managed by
it as well plus lots of other things that are noted in that why systemd blog
post i mentioned.

much of the extra functionality is not stuff that sysvinit (or even upstart)
support natively but rather additional infrastructure was added to support it.
were they strictly necessary?  I don't know for sure.  I do know
that some of the things, such as service activation based on events, was not
something that sysvinit mechanisms did at all.  There were all sorts of script
hacks to make this type of thing work, but I do know that they weren't always
robust.

This is why systemd isn't just an init replacement. init is a process kicked
off that is intended to kick off other services and that's it.

systemd does this as well as provides alot of other infrastructure
to talk to alot of the other system-wide components that most linux distros
are standardizing on (d-bus, udev, etc etc).  Arguably sysvinit could
have remained as the proper init, and instead called out to additional
infrastructure processes to do all the work, but that point, why not
just replace the whole thing?

It is desirable to keep init around for when systemd inevitably crashes, taking
down everything with it.  That's one of the key design decisions that was made
about SMF at Sun.  At least in the early stages, the plan was that one could
actually upgrade SMF on the fly on a running system.  (I'm assuming that
capability is still there, but I can't say I've tried it in ages.)

FWIW, replacing init with launchd is one of my big complaints about OS X for
the exact same reason.

The bigger pid 1 is, the more likely it's going to be the source of problems.
Sure, sysvinit and other systems don't have all of these features.  But should
they?  I'm not sure it is desirable to have something like quotas handled here.
In fact, I'd say from a server perspective, most of this list is fairly
useless crap. (Of course, I might have a different perspective than most
admins due to the scale, but I'd be surprised if that many people are really
replacing devices that often in even smaller sized server farms.)

Also, when will emacs adopt systemd? Anyone know?

can understand why alot of it isn't useful, but from the PC world, it's quite
useful.  much of the supported features are effectively to support the "random"
ness of hardware and use cases in the PC world.  udev and d-bus and
NetworkManager all grew out of effectively needing to abstract out the hardware
and network layers because it was getting too complicated to deal with all the
individual requirements out there.

Sure, if you're building a server, and you know EXACTLY what you're putting

you have no idea what user xyz is going to shovel into it other than that
the drivers exist in the kernel, this really makes certain things easier

I want to move around a shit ton of that mail.  Divide it up more finely by
folders, because I have too much mail in too few folders for my liking.

Can I *physically move files* from one Maildir directory to another?

(the Maildir has subdirectories, like .Archives/, .2012, etc.)

Or should I rely on a program which is dedicated to working with maildirs to do
that for me?

While I can see why you'd think that Raub, the truth is that GNU started that
movement a long time ago.  It's just getting more obvious now that they are
replacing lots and lots of small things with very very big things.

FWIW, I had a lot of hate for Sun's SMF but learned to love it after using it
for a while.  I still think having the scripts stored as XML and the location
of things are HUGE flaws though.  So the basic part of systemd: I totally get.
It's the "... and the kitchen sink" part I take offense to.

Faunus: I hear imap and maildir, which are you targetting AND why?

My guess is you want to move the source imap and have the maildir sync faster
by pre-moving the files, save time and bandwidth. Correct? As far as
offlineimap is concerned, not a good move, better to just let imap trickle
through, IMHO. If I'm not mistaken, offlineimap will replicate the imap moves,
not just re-copy the messages.

 Port metadata information (proposed by Lennart Poettering)

To have a port independent metadata information would be good to have. The
current model with a static assignment of ports and protocols from
/etc/services is not a good solution and is not reflecting current use cases.
Ports in applications or services are dynamic and therefore the port itself
does not describe the use case.

that port independent metadata shit is scary.

so i wnat to allow "music sharing"
what does that actually mean and what ports am I going to effectively open up?
at the bottom level, it's all iptables anyways, as you said.  Do I really want
a firewall doing shit that I don't really?  One of the "problems" with
firewalld is d-bus integration.  While d-bus isn't as horrendously insecure
as upnp, it's got the same potential to have lots of unintended consequences.

the current firewalld implementation seems pretty sane.  Add abstract ideas
like using natural languages to configure a firewall seems really goofy

The glitches I've hit so far are:

    * `fontconfig` errors for any app that uses fonts, i.e., every app.

    * Grabbing and moving windows with ALT-drag no longer works. Since it
      has worked for, oh, 20 years, it may be a while before my motor cortex
      un-learns it!

    * It installed a lot of *-debuginfo packages.
      Not sure why it did that. I don't plan on debugging `nss-softtok`
      anytime soon.

    * There's a thin horizontal gray line across the screen about 10% up from

rendering and hinting configuration per fonts.
The Paktype fonts have been updated with enhancements for better coverage.
New fonts lohit-tamil-classical-fonts for Tamil and kalapi-fonts for Gujarati
have been added.
madan-fonts for Nepali, navilu-fonts and gubbi-fonts for Kannada now support
the minimum required characters as per fontconfig file for their respective
languages.
$HOME/.fonts.conf is deprecated. Users are encouraged to move it to
$HOME/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf.
$HOME/.fonts.conf.d is deprecated. Users are encouraged to move it to
$HOME/.config/fontconfig/conf.d
All the disabled fontconfig config files in /etc/fonts/conf.avail have been
moved to /usr/share/fontconfig/conf.avail. If you have any local symbolic links

response from Internet for 66.101.16.172.in-addr.arpa

Since I know that if I use zone "101.16.172.in-addr.arpa" IN { it works as it
should, I must believe it is ignoring my reverse zone and asking the big wide
world to resolve my request. I thought that starting the zone with either 64-27

downgrading shortly after an upgrade is fairly common.
F18 goes into a freeze shortly before release which means updates is also
frozen. so updates start building up in updates-testing.

however F17 updates are still flowing.

The upgrade process will not downgrade packages taht are "newer" and by
newer it uses the version string, not the build string (fc18/fc19)

very shortly before release (usually a day or two or the day of) updates is
unfrozen and updates-testing start flowing in, but then there's the issue
of the mirrors being in sync :)

So yeah, it's kind of goofy but early in the release cycle the previous release
actually has newer package versions alot :)

It's not though.  If you could transfer all your apps and music to ANY itunes
library it would mean you could take your phone and give free copies of all
your music and apps to an unlimited number of people.



People do switch computers, and hard drives do die... that's why you have
a backup of your itunes library.

I wish we could be there watching you do this. Multiple people in the forum
have described how they did EXACTLY what you want to do without any sort of
difficulty. The problem here seems to be a lack of experience with iTunes,
coupled with the fact that you're not only trying to set up a new phone, but
also with a new instance of iTunes was never used with the old phone and never
had the apps downloaded previously. It does work exactly as you want it to work
if it's the same iTunes that you had used for the previous phone. I've done it
when going from a 3 to a 3S, and then from that 3S to another 3S (water
damage), and then to my 4S a year ago. It was easy, and it just worked. But I
also used the same computer and the same iTunes setup for all.

I'm really not being obtuse. I cannot figure it out (yet).

Actually, I think that iTunes/Apple are trying to be *so* friendly to
non-computer-types that they are *harder* to use for people who know what they
are doing. The problem is that I know exactly what I want to do and how it
*should* work, according to every other piece of software I've ever used.

Maybe I have to Think Different. ;)

So here is where I am at, at least with Apps:
1) All Apps are in iTunes
2) Apps installed on old iPhone are a subset of all Apps
3) Apps on old iPhone are organized into groups on multiple pages
4) I just want to get those apps and how they are organized on to the new phone

I've tried:
1) Backup of old, restore to new -> No luck
2) Sync old, backup old, restore new, sync new -> No luck

I'm not sure what else to try. All the settings and options described in the
articles I find are for old versions of iTunes, and this new version that I
have doesn't look anything like that anymore.

It's going to be painful, but I think in your case, you will need to do the
following:

1) Sync Old, Backup Old, Unplug Old
2) Plug New, let Sync complete
3) IGNORE current state of New phone
4) Click on the the new phone icon in the upper right
5) Go through each individual tick item
5a) Summary, bang out any iOS update
5b) Info, set your contacts/etc (probably want everything disabled in your
case)
5c) Apps, Disable Auto sync new apps, manually tick on/off your desired apps to
load on the phone, rearrange apps in the GUI on the right (move apps, create
desired replicated folder structure from old phone)
5d> Tones, set your tones (probably disabled in your use case)
5e) Music, set your music (probably to all, unless you have iTunes Match)
5f) Movies, set your movies (probably disabled in your use case again)
5g) TV Shows, set your TV shows (probably disabled in your use case)
5h) Podcasts, set your podcast options (probably disabled)
5i) Books, set your book options (probably to all)
5j) Photos, set your photo options (probably disabled in your use case, since
you store phones only locally on your phone and not on your iTunes computer)
6) Hit Sync on the bottom right

Then you have 2 options
1) Keep PC and iTunes install up to date, never touch it again until you get
the next iPhone.  Then sync the current iPhone w/ iTunes on that same PC before
plugging in the iPhone 6+ and get everything back in one shot w/o reconfiguring
from scratch.
2) Do this same exercise again, since you'll have a new PC w/ a new iTunes
install

I'm not a big fan of iTunes, but I've definitely been conditioned by the
product to the point where I know what I can/can't do with it.  I view iTunes
as the unwelcome cleaning space dock that I need to go to every day.  I plug my
iPhone in for power every night, and I let it do all that it needs to do. 
While it's loading, I head over to Podcast and I refresh to get all the latest
updates.  Then I head to apps to check for updates.  Once both are complete, I
hit sync again to push the changes.  It removes all my played podcasts, and
then I close iTunes (while leaving my phone plugged in).  When I go to bed, I
shut down my PC, unplug my fully charged iPhone, and then I'm on my merry way
again.  I don't even bother using iTunes to browse/purchase music; I do it all
over the phone.  It's strictly my backup/restore utility.  It picks up any
changes I make to the GUI, in addition to apps that I've newly installed/set up
on the phone.  It's annoying, but I always have my PC on at night.  If I forget
to plug the phone in today, I'll get to it tomorrow and I won't be out of sync.

Make sure that all apps on your phone are in itunes. (Choose idevice->

Go into your idevice in itunes and go to the "Apps" tab and see which Apps are
set to sync to itunes,(this is the step I think  you have been missing.)

Make sure that all apps youw ant to be included in your backup (and thus
in your restore for the new phone) are set to sync.

Sync itunes.  (thus syncing all app data.)

Backup your idevice.

Restore to your new idevice.


These instructions are just for Apps. You'll have to look at the other tabs
for sync settings for other stuff.

I do have one quasi-interesting backup story.

When I bought my iphone 5, my iMac was in the apple store getting its
display replaced.  So I backed up my iphone 4S to my work imac. I went
to the apple store and picked up my iphone 5.

When I went to restore my iphone 5, it asked for a backup password.

Apparently, when I first backedup my iphone 4S, I told itunes (and thus,
the iphone 4S) to password protect backups of this device.


But I had no clue what password I used, and I tried  every password
I could think of.  After some googling around I realized that I could
just use Keychain Access (Mac OS X's password manager) to read my password.

Well, my password only got stored in Keychain Access during the intial
backup when itunes (on my personal iMac) prompted me to create a password
for the backups. But, my perosnal iMac was at Apple getting repaired.

So, I just used my iphone 5 for a few days without the full restore
(all of my contacts and other shit was syncing to icloud anyway.)
When I got my iMac back from Apple, I read my password out of the Keychain
Access app.

My password was my first fucking name.

it still seems slightly odd to me that itunes would ask you to create a backup
password, store that passwrd on the device, and never again ask you for the
password through months and months of doing backups, until you try to do
a restore.

I always wanted itunes to add my songs to a queue when I doulbe click them,

Okay, for all of you Spiderweb Software experts.
I'm looking at the Spiderweb Software Complete Bundle on Steam.

Only problem I'm seeing is that they didn't include Exile/Avernum 2 and 3.
They have Avernum: Escape from the Pit, and Avernum 4-6.
Only thing I can think of is Avernum: EftP contains the first 3 Avernum/Exile
games.
Anybody know this?

Thanks.

My main job issues people lapdogs, and in my group, the budget is about $2K.
I didn't take them up on it my first 3.5 years, since my 13" Pro was and is
just fine (2.26GHz/8GB/500GB upgraded HD) but now that it's a half-year past
the end of AppleCare, I thought I'd go a little easier on it.

At this job, I use my laptop for accessing lots of web-based resources (info,
logging systems, etc), creating technical documentation (Word, iPhoto,
Photoshop), filling in timesheets (Excel), VPN (Juniper), and a little
mucking around with photos and time-lapse videos (iPhoto, Photoshop, QT7).
So basically any MacBook would do just fine.

Whatever I get will be getting dragged back and forth between sea level
and 13,800 feet (unpressurized), environments climate-controlled and not,
wi-fi some places and wired LAN other places.  It'll probably live in a
backpack along with some photo gear.

Possibilities I'm looking at are (educational pricing):

$1672.00 - Pro 13", 2.9GHz/8GB/1TB HD, AppleCare
$1756.00 - Air 11.6", 2.0GHz/8GB/256GB SSD, AppleCare, TB-GigE
$1811.00 - Retina 13", 2.5GHz/8GB/128GB SSD, AppleCare, TB-GigE
$1841.00 - Air 13", 2.0GHz/8GB/256GB SSD, AppleCare, TB-GigE
$1942.00 - Pro 13", 2.9GHz/8GB/256GB SSD, AppleCare

Any thoughts one way or another?

Stay way from the mechanical HD if you can afford to spend a little more.
the SSDs will make your machines faster and they are more reliable especially
in applications where you are doing a lot of moving and carrying it around.

Since you are doing video editing I'd probably go with a faster CPU system
(that said, I don't edit a lot of videos, but I do a lot of video re-encoding.)

that would land you at
$1811.00 - Retina 13", 2.5GHz/8GB/128GB SSD, AppleCare, TB-GigE

As the most cost efficetive choice. But if you are storing videos , you
likely need a lot of hard drive space, so I would recommend
$1942.00 - Pro 13", 2.9GHz/8GB/256GB SSD, AppleCare
You'd get the added advantage of having the retina display.

Of course, all I have really done is say "Get the most expensive
things, but it does the most."  Well.. of course it does..

Am I correct that there is no way to tell iTunes to *only* transfer the songs

Once I downloaded all purchases into iTunes, there are about 300 apps that she
has previously downloaded and installed. She only had about 120 of them

Do I really have to manually select the apps she had before, and re-install

losing the upgradability to get the retina, but the retina displays on the MPBS

I'm also not sure why a retina MBP is "bound to break under strenuous

Someone essientially asked "Why would one pay MORE for X, when they can have Y
for less."
I was just trying to give some asnwers. They don't give a crap about the retina
display despite its awesomeness and they want an optical drive
and they may want to swap the memory or hard drive (or put another
hard drive in the optical bay.)  And obviously, they don't care that
the machine is heavier and bulkier.

There is a noticeable difference in the retina vs-non Retina displays. But it
doesn't mean you'll actually benefit from the extra resolution. My current MBP
purchasing decision was more or less similar: I need something that will
withstand getting moved a lot, having an Ethernet port as clients will rarely
give away WiFi access so everything's done by Ethernet; upgradability and the
thing should last me at least 3 years for tax purposes.

For example, while I might not use much the optical drive, the extra space can
serve me to put in a second HDD, probably an SSD one for the zillion VMs I need
for work. That cant be done with a Retina. Ditto on upgrading an HDD.

Based on Shag's requirements, I'd go for the cheapest, upgradable option and
upgrade the rest if needed later. I'm basing this on my case, which had mostly
the same budget: I had a $2000 budget to buy the Mac + accessories.

I'm pretty much with Danix .
there is definitely a noticeable difference between the retina and non-retina.
the retina does indeed look nicer, but at the same time, from a functional
perspective, for most things, it doesn't add anything more to it.
from a real estate perspective, it's effectively 1440x900 quad pixeled

for most things, you end up with less useable real estate than a 1680x1050
1920x1200 or 1080p screen.

at this point, if i had the option between 1440x900quad or 1920x1080
i'd take the 1920x1080.

I have to admit, apple's scaling capabilities are pretty impressive, but i'd
have to wonder how long before you start noticing artifacts of non-even scaling
and i know there've been reports of battery consumption at non-native scaling.

what i really want 3840x2160, or even better 3840x2400 on a 15.x" laptop
screen.

a long layover in Atlanta, so I made a reservation at the Lenox Square
store, took MARTA up, they looked at it and 10-20 minutes later, I was good
to go.

The second time, my trackpad had been acting really crazy, and my I was in
Honolulu with my wife (she got upgraded) right next to Ala Moana Center, so
I took it to the Genius Bar there, and they replaced both the pad and the
battery (which they and I both suspected might be bulging against the
bottom of the pad) overnight for me to pick up in the morning before flying
out.

(Yes, my MBPs are high-mileage. ;)

Thanks for all the responses about which laptop to get, folks!

You guys do realize that the 15" Retina MBP can run at a screen size that's
equivalent to 1920x1200, right? That's what I run mine at... gives me TONS more
real estate than the 1680x1050 "high res" option on the non-retina MBP.

And it has the added benefit of still looking stunningly beautiful.

Hell, if you're nuts, you can actually run the retina MBP at its native
resolution of 2880x1800. That's some real screen real estate there.

  Hrm, so the "restoring images" stopped short.
  iTunes says my phone has 2533 photos, but the phone says it has 1531.
  wtf? should I click sync? restore backup? restore iphone?
  Or can I just get the images/videos from some where out of itunes?

If you are talking about images in the camera roll, they are included in the
backup.
If you are talking about images in your photo albums, iTunes assumes you are
syinging from your photo manager (iPhoto on a Mac, and whatever iTunes uses
with Windows.)

So, I've been using iTunes Match to rip my music collection, and all is well,
but two oddities I wanted to ask people about:

1) iTunes used to automatically upload things to Match as I ripped new CDs, but
all of a sudden it just.. Stopped.  Now it seems like I have to choose "Update
Match" from the menu in order for it to upload anything.

2) It also stopped automatically getting album artwork for new albums I've
ripped.

3) I imported a bunch of MP3s last night, and they didn't show up in the music
list, recently added etc.  When I checked back this morning, they were there.
WTF? :) (Other people are reporting this on the Apple Support forums)

Overall I'm pleased as punch with Match, and these are hardly show stoppers,
just wondering if anyone has seen this or had any ideas.

Feoh, I have been trying to learn all fo the little nuances.

When I get my iMac back from Apple today (ahem, speakin  of apple care)
I will try what you have done to see how long it takes to everything
to sync in the cloud.

One small thing I notice is that my playlists updates sync fine from computer
to computer but not on my idevices. I have to force the playlists to sync by
turning itunes match off and back on, which costs me some time.

I asked the genius about it, but he didn't have a clue.

His initial order said shipping in two weeks.  It's been three weeks and it
still says shipping in two weeks.

Yesterday, he called Apple and the person he spoke with said that LG is
manufacturing some portion of the display.  They produce whatever
component in batches of 100,000.  LG was late delivering the first order
of components which means they're now also late on delivering their second
batch to Apple.

Today he checked the status and it says his order is listed as "shipment
pending." Either timing coincidence or complaining helps.

Apple Care:

I have been kinda dissapointed with my iMac's quality . I bought it in
Mid-2010.
I upgraded it a bit at purchase time because I wanted it to be my big family
rig where I would house all of my photos and itunes stuff, share with my kids
and play games.

So, with all that in mind I bought  Apple Care. It's a good damn thing I did
too.  After about 2 years I started noticing blotches on the screen.
They'd appear on the login screen and sometimes within the border of some of
the windowed applications. So I couldn't tell if it was hardware or software.
Apple replaced the display, I believe. I still saw the behavior later. Apple
replaced the mainboard and the display. Problem went away for a while but still
showeed at very rare times. I ended up putting a fresh install of Mac OS X
on the system and then re-importing my data/apps from backup without
reimporting my system settings. The problem went away for months so I thought
"well shit, it was a software problem after all."  well, not to far back I saw
a slight re-occurrence of the problem.  I have not bitched about this instance
yet. I took my iMac back to apple for a whole different reason. The optical
drive conked out. Well they took it in to replace the optical drive and called
me because when they went to put the mainboard back together, the display
wasn't working. They said the part that connects to the display got wedged
in the encasement, or something.

At this point, I wold be scared to have an iMac without Apple Care.
I almost sold my iMac last month to buy one of the new ones. I think I will
have to sell this one as my Apple Care warranty expires, unless I want to start
doing my own work on the iMac. (but at this stage of my life, I don't care to
take my home computer apart. I want to use it, not fix it.)

I have a mid-2010 iMac as well.  I love it, but also had display blotch.  They

component of the panel getting too hot and changing color.

I also had a problem where my SD card reader wouldn't recognize SD cards
unless I rebooted. I found an Apple form post where a guy explained that
there's a tiny plunger switch inside the slot which informs the computer that
it should try to mount an SD card.  The plunger can get stuck and you can
dislodge it with a toothpick.  I tried that and it worked.

The photostream technically lives in your iloud account, but when your phone

($1841.00 - Air 13", 2.0GHz/8GB/256GB SSD, AppleCare, TB-GigE).  After
reading everyone's advice and thinking about it for a while, I decided
that for this job:

1. I definitely don't need Retina, so that ruled out the Retina.
2. I don't need an optical drive, so the Air was more of an option.
3. I like 1440x900 and an SD slot, so I chose the 13" over the 11".

The chief of my division just emailed to say it's approved.  *happy dance*

I'm still considering the Retina 13" for the next time I have enough money
to buy a "personal" laptop, though - that display would be handy for my

There are already corporate clouds.

"cloud" is a term that sends me into a micro-rage every time I hear it.
It's a vague term for the plethora of ways to make data available over a
network.

SAN or NAS can be a back-end for a cloud, but it is not the cloud, itself.
To me, the "cloud" sits directly on top of the applications/server providing
the "cloud" service (of which there are many.)

Once example of cloud document sharing/storing internal to corporate
environment would be Microsoft Sharepoint.

Sharepoint is not cloud, it's shit. :)

To me, "cloud" just means you store things but you don't have to worry about
the logistics of the storage. It just goes somewhere, like magic. You fully
delegate server maintenance, physical storage, uptime, backups, etc to some
other service so you don't have to worry about any of it.

What I *really* wish was that Windows and other OS's would allow me to abstract
my storage in a cloud-like way.

I want "Pictures", "Videos", "Movies", etc stored in logical places on my
computer. But I want to be able to hook up those types of storage to different
providers in the background. So every time I store a "Picture" (based on
extension), it might save it to the local drive, or Picasa Web, or Flickr, etc.
The computer wouldn't care. But every app that workd with "Pictures" would
interface with my Pictures container.

Almost like Windows "Libraries" but actually useful.

I sometimes see stuff like SANs as cloudy because if well setup, it gives you
the kind of availability you'd expect on a cloud. Multi-path IO, failover,
whatever. You get your OS to "see" a simple HDD, but the "HD" is actually a LUN
sitting on a server that has RAID6 arrays where your data is actually stored
at.

Something more akin to a cloud would be VMWare's ESX stuff. You put that on a
cluster of servers, and it will pool all the CPU, RAM and Storage resources as
one big blob and give you the "pool" for you to create VMs on top of that.

SANs in and of themselves aren't cloudy at all.
Sure the server has a LUN, but the server also needs a lot of configuration of
- Fibre Channel Host Bus adapter driver and settings
- Host multipathing subystem
- and in many cases you'll want to install some host cluster ware in order
  to have a failover server that shares the same disk/LUN in the event
  that the first server dies.

This is why SAN vendors provide "attach kits" to help you make sure you
setup the nooks and crannies right.

You're not at the point where you have a cloud until the entitiy accessing the
data doesn't care how it's being accessed.

I never understood the need to spend that much on a PC unless you were heavily
into gaming, video editing or creating other graphics-intensive products.

In 2008 I took a tax refund and invested in a quad-core Intel, 4 GB of RAM, a
dual-head video card, hard drive and a DVD burner for around $400. Already had
a nice enough case that I got FAR, as well as another hard drive and a few
other pieces. It will turn 5 years old this coming March and it's still kicking
some decent enough ass, and only occasionally can it tell its age. Over the
years I've replaced two failing hard drives, a couple of sticks of RAM that
went bad, two power supplies that were already old (one w/ a lifetime warranty
that was also FAR), added a media card reader, upgarded to a video card with
dual DVI outputs and replaced two aging-but-working beheamoth CRT deathscreens
with a nice pair of 23" backlit LEDs.

If I wanted to do any further upgrades, I'd probably look at maxing out my RAM
(if I can even find it) or seeing if I can find a CPU upgrade w/o replacing the
mother board. If I have to replace the motherboard, I'm probably jumping to an
i3 at the very least.

I was going to post that printers have been lagging in advancement over the
years compared to just about everything else when it comes to cost
effectiveness, efficiency and innovation.

My favorite, and current printer is a really old used HP laser 3015.
I don't even know how much toner was in it when I bought it but I have had it
for something like 4 or 5 years and still have not had to purchase toner for
it. Problem is it does not scan. I have a photosmart 2600xi for that,
but HP stopped making drivers for the printer as of Mac OS X 10.7, and
forces you to use the built in Mac driver. Well, the built in mac driver
doesn't support scanning. So at some point I'll buy a laster that
prints, faxes, scans and airprints (or whatever the common non-apple
name for that is.)

But you would think someone would have come along by now and produced a
really good solid printer that was reliable and relatively  low cost,
easy to use and blown everyone else out of the water.

The trick with inkjets is to run test pages every 3-4 weeks to keep the
ink from drying up or else you have to clean it which is messy and doesn't
always work right. :)

HP's Cartridges, actually have the nozzles on the cartridge, so if it
does dry up, you don't have to clean the stupid nozzles and it gets
rid of any ink that has built-up.

  I don't think there is anyway to see all open windows, in windows7.
  Alt+tab, by default, in the "aero" view shows a 2d list of all open
  apps and you switch between them. If you pause, it will do "aero peek".
  Windows+tab gives a "3d" view, but is more or less the same thing, just
  bigger so you can get a preview of the app before you switch to it.

  I had to disable aero alt+tab because the OS would try to guess what
  order the apps should be in, instead of just leaving it the PHUCK alone!
  by disabling that, i got the XP alt+tab and the order of the apps is
  normal (last used). But I lost "aero peek" which I liked. ug.

  Haven't tried Win8 yet.

  The downside is the order, not the peek.
  If you leave windows to the default (aero) alt+tab, and you have 5+ windows
  open, the order will not be FIFO, it will be some PHUCKED UP random shit
  that I don't understand nor do I care to understand.
  I want the peek, but i can't have the order messed up. so i'm left
  disabling aero.

WinKey + Tab is called "Flip 3d".  I think that if you have less than 4 windows

  I think the break even point for laser printers is just farther in the
  future. You pay 2x for the printer and 2x for the toner, but it lasts
  4x longer, it will just take a longer time for the toner savings to
  break even on the extra cost of the printer, vs inkjets.

ink cartridges are easy to get (amazon is my friend, there), and overall I've
been more than happy with its performance and quality.

The one catch: when I first set it up, I had to set my network to broadcast for
the printer to see it.  When I've needed to reset it since (I forget why) it
was fine, but it didn't like manual setup that first time.  On the other hand,
I've had to do the same with a couple of friends' new machines, so it may be
some router setting I'm unaware of that plays poorly with some others.

I am geniunly curious. the 3.5 TB drive would eithe rhav emore platters or
(which I would think would actually make certain opertations faster in terms of
bandwidth) or the 3.5 TB drive would have greater granularity in terms of
secotrs on the platter.

Of course, in Semuta's case, there are still a lot of things that can  be
different between the two drives.

Plus with plattered drives, I have noticed that some of them just get slower at
some point. I had a disk once that made my entire OS slow. Remove the disk and
BAM, my OS perked right up (and it was not even my system disk.)

  What do you need windows for? That might help us determine if some option
  is better than another.

  I've not used Win8, but i'm less resistent to change that people here.
  I do believe that win8 is better on a touch screen, but I don't believe
  that it is HORRIBLE w/o as some would have you believe. Plus, if you
  can get the start menu back, who cares?

  As posted previously, you can pay the $40 for win8 and legally downgrade
  to win7 (I think win8 pro allows this). Since you plan on doing this
  in a VM, I'd say:
  Confirm you can downgrade $40 win8 pro
  Buy it, run it in a VM, see if you like it.
  If not, downgrade it to win7.

  1. God damn printer says 2 other inks that were not touched are not

     Cyan 78/77). DA FUCK?!
     So she was able to "print" a few times with these carts (noted

  2. Brand spanking new black in, is down to what appears to be 75% and
     NOTHING was successfully printed. My wife only ran the cleaning
     cycle 2-3 times because when she printed, it came out blank, then it
     came out SUPER light.

  Oh yeah. Epson Stylus RX595. Win7.
  Genuine Epson ink.

  Google suggests using an eraser on the contacts. Tried that. No go.
  Not to sure i want to try erasing the contacts in the printer, that would
  leave little pieces of eraser inside...

  I put the old working black cart in, now it says yellow, black and
  light cyan are unrecognized.

  This type of shit makes me want to get a laser printer, except we
  mostly use our printer for photos. I don't think laser printers
  have a leg to stand on in that regards.

  Epson's Troubleshooting Guide says to call support. Great.

  I blame my wife for leaving the printer on all the time.

email security

  I know that's an oxymoron...
  Its very convenient to have stuff emailed to me (example I just got:
  my automatic toll payment statement: texas tag) as a PDF. However,
  it is completely insecure, right? Anyone can intercept the email and
  the attachment and see my statement.

  The statement has my account number, full name, full address, the txtag
  id numbers (i have 2 cars, each has one).

  Am I paranoid or legitimate concern?
  How about other statements?

Email is essentially plain text, so anyone who obtains/intercepts a copy can
read it, yes. The thing is, a random intercept is unlikely, and though it
happens most admins don't go rifling through email (esp large organizations).
So to me it becomes a risk assessment. Take your registration - so they have
your account#, tag#, name/address, etc. Who is going to go after your email to
get that, and what can they do with it? Pretty low risk to me. If they were
including a full credit card or bank account number, I'd be concerned. But only
you can decide on your acceptable level of risk.

Of course, if the NSA, FBI or other three-letter agency are after you, they

flat out that the NSA is the biggest single user of power. Also, I know that we

buy a cheapo Dell computer and upgrade the RAM and video card myself later.  If
I was needing to buy a computer right now that had Windows 7 on it, I'd
probably start with the Dell Small Business section and look at the Vostro 270
line.  You can get a pretty damn good computer for $329 currently.

As for your question about the "Pentium Gxxx" line, they're a sandy bridge
processor, basically slightly worse than a low end Core i3, but plenty good
enough for most everything that people use the computer for.  For example,
cpu-benchmark shows a score of 2660 for the Pentium G645 processor, while the
Core i3-2100 scores 3638.  This may seem like a huge difference, but keep in
mind that a Core2Duo E7500 scores 1837, so it's still a much better processor
than the Core2Duo line, and those are still pretty awesome processors for the
average person.

Within the same generation, there are celeron, pentium, i3, i5 and i7s
listed in roughly performance order (note i said roughly, as there are cases
where i5s are better than i7s depending on the load and the specific cpu).
once again, with the same generation, the CPUs in each line (celeron, pentium
i3/i5/i7) are generally given some number notation and as a rule of thumb, the
higher the number, the faster it is.  Once again, that's a rough rule of thumb.
A quad core with slightly slower individual core speeds could be rated
at a higher number than a dual core with faster individual core clock, in that
case the quad would have more computing power, but the dual core might actually
be faster for real world tasks.

Across the individual lines the main differences are size of cache, speed of
cpu, number of cores, number of virtual execution units, and specific features
such as whether or not hardware assisted virtualization is supported, things
like that.

for most non-enthusiasts systems as Billyjoejimbob noted, the lowest end sandy
bridge cpu holds it's own against a fairly high end core 2 duo.

so honestly at this point, for most people, the cpu doesn't matter.
That said there is generally a good correlation between slower cheaper cpus and
other cheaper, less reliable parts.
celeron/pentium is generally equated with the low end and thus you're likely
looking at lower end other things too, which may or may not be a concern.

Dell, lenovo and HP tend to be at the top end of most reliability ratings for
desktop PCs, although they are also the top selling vendors.

i still build my own and will likely continue to, but i have reasons to do
so that the average computer user likely doesn't care about

As I understand it:

  This is the current HP/UX version:   http://iscabbs.com/iscabbs.tar.gz

  This is the Linux port:              http://iscabbs.com/files/iscabbs.tar.gz

"If the issue with migration to Linux is testing, why does the private data of
the current BBS need to be involved at all?"

  Ideally, they'd like to migrate the existing usernames, account data, post
history, Mail> history, forum info, etc.  And my understanding is that the
programming and tools to accomplish this is 90% complete, and once testing is
done, we can move to Linux with almost literally 2-3 key strokes.

  However, if we have lost access to the old box indefinitely, we obviously
would have to manually migrate everything, with some losses.  This is the
project I was talking about running in Future>, but that's a lot of work and if
we can avoid it by recovering machine access, I think we should.  My
understanding is that the Board is actively engaged in this process.

"Can a testing server be provided and people invited to create accounts, to use
it, to socialize and engage in discussion in some selection of test forums with
the understanding that it's temporary?"

  This is a Future> topic I think, but I agree.  I think it would do wonders
for the BBS community's interest in participating in development if we could
agree to an "official" development platform/location, an "official" bug
list/feature list for people to add things to, and let people go use the test
system to try out new stuff.  Once we migrate, that "official" test platform
can continue to be the test platform, we'll need one anyway.

"Once the Linux port is ready for prime-time, the test data can be deleted and
the actual BBS data migrated.  There's no need for access to the current BBS
private data to get a test BBS up and running (unless I am completely missing
something.. am I?)"

  Exactly.

"If we have access to the working Linux code, why is access to "official"
(Tiberius'?) server necessary?"

  See above.  We can instantly and seamlessly migrate everything.

"I guess this boils down to: ISCA has the ball and hasn't, apparently, wanted
to play.  Can we copy the ball and go play with it somewhere else and then pass
it back to ISCA once it's done?"

  As I've said in Future>, whether or not this is or was true, there appears to
be good, positive momentum going right now and I think it's a mistake to chip
away at it with blame, negativity, or complaining.  I recommend that we foster
and support the current mood, which is enthusiastic and forward-looking, and
stop trying to figure out who to blame.

Part of the migration is converting the datafiles to x86.  In fact, that's the
part that we need to test.  We need to test the conversion of the current data,
essentially making sure that everyone can see their Mail>, invite-only forums,
etc.  We only have the ability to check public forums, so we need to run a test
BBS, with current userdata, and involve the userbase in testing.

"There's no need for access to the current BBS
private data to get a test BBS up and running (unless I am completely missing
something.. am I?)"

Yep, you are.  See above.  It's impossible to test the migration of the data
without the data.

"I guess this boils down to: ISCA has the ball and hasn't, apparently, wanted

play"

That's not an accurate assessment.  ISCA does want to play.

None of this stuff is ABSOLUTELY VITAL but it'd sure be nice to make a smooth
cutover, and if that's something within the realm of reasonable possibility if
we can simply regain some access to the box, it's an avenue worth pursuing, if
for no other reason than to firmly establish that access has been indefinitely
lost.

Lochner>  Here's an alternative migration plan:

1)  Get the Linux port up and running at bbs2.iscabbs.com.

2)  During that time, gather a list of "all" (or at least "active" users).

3)  Create those users into the new system with randomly generated passwords.

4)  Email those random passwords to those users via the "old" BBS along with a
    template message on how to connect to the "new" BBS.  Divide this task to
    "trusted" users or sysops.

5)  Get a list of all the forums and re-create them in the new BBS with the
    proper FM assigned (if the FM wasn't in the user migration list, add them
    to it).  Divide this task to as many people who will help.

 ... Now we are operating in dual-BBS mode ...

6)  When FMs log into the new system, they can update the FI from the old BBS.
    They can also deal with invite-only forums however they see fit.

7)  At this point, users can test the new system and bugs can be filed/fixed.

8)  Research on how to import forum posts can be explored during this phase as
    well.

9)  At some point, everyone signs off on the Linux version, bbs2.iscabbs.com
    becomes bbs.iscabbs.com, the forum posts are either imported or they
    aren't, the old bbs code/machine is retired and we are off to the races.

People that abide by this will have a seemless migration.  A Lobby post should
also be made echoing the same instructions.  Provided we do this soon enough
(like next week), and given the Linux port will take more than 4 months to
finish, there should be no users who didn't get the message.

Figured now is as good of a time as any to post something here.  This is not an
officially sanctioned ISCA message or anything, it's just my personal statement
on where we're at.



I joined the board in April of this year and my sole mission was to either get
a copy of the Linux port of ISCA from Tiberius, or persuade ISCA that he was
not likely to turn it over to us in a reasonable time frame, and we should move
forward on the assumption that we'll never see it.  That meant either porting
DOC on our own or going with another solution.

We tried both -- trying to get a copy of the code, and trying to port DOC.
Both efforts were unsuccessful and ISCA debated what to do next.  The
conclusion was that a revised "roadmap" was appropriate, whereby ISCA would
license Gestalt, and port the BBS to that platform.  We drafted a roadmap and
are officially voting to adopt it over the next few weeks.

Assuming that the vote ratifies the roadmap, we have a tentative deadline of
July 1, 2012, for moving to Gestalt, though many of us feel that we could
accomplish this more rapidly.  A number of steps are required to get from this
point to the end point, including legal work, technical work, and firm project
management.

Regardless, we are optimistic that we will finally move forward.  I appreciate
everybody's patience and hope you all will continue to support and foster our
community as we work.  As one of the (marginally competant) programmers
involved with some of these projects, I will attempt to keep you informed of
what I'm working on in Coding ISCABBS>, and requests for features should be
directed to Future>.

Thank you again for sticking with us.

The July 1 date was picked because it is a date which seemed reasonable because
it doesn't assume that the schedule will fall into place perfectly, with real
life getting in the way, and of course unknowns that we cannot predict but have
to be accounted for when setting a hard deadline without having all the facts.
Chances are the date will be easily beat as Lochner said, but it is also
entirely possible to miss as well. That's why it is tentative, until we have
all the requirements, the feature set (we won't have a complete functional spec
or anything but we do need to compile requirements and prioritized features),
and also a test install up and running with users actually logging into it.

We do have a procedure in place for communicating with ISCA, though it often

votes for, one abstain, and since a majority vote has been attained voting is
now closed. The official roadmap of the BBS of ISCA, Inc. consists of the
following:


1. Move to Gestalt for the primary use
2. Keep DOC running, if possible, accessed through Gestalt*

The matter is decided and now the policy board and programmers will begin
acting upon this decision.  Continued discussion of the migration to Linux
is not only allowed, but encouraged.

Basically, we want members who are willing to participate, even if it consists
of criticism, so long as it is /constructive/ criticism. The reason ISCA
votes on membership is twofold: first, because the bylaws require it, and
secondly, to avoid problem users.  We do ask that input be productive, rather
than constant heckling. We had one such member, and one of those was enough.

There are dues involved but the dues are minimal (it goes toward paying for
hosting, legal fees such as filing paperwork, and so forth), and are
unfortunately necessary. That is one reason moving to Linux is important; we
can move to an inexpensive VPS rather than stay on expensive colocation
solutions.

BODY: 

There have been some questions about how it is that there is a copy of the
"Linux port" of DOC on the BBS web site, yet we are dependent upon Tiberius to
send us a copy of the Linux port.

The answer is that there is "a" Linux port on the ISCABBS web site.  You can
download it and compile it, and if you can re-create the runtime environment,
directory structure, etc, you can get it to work in single-user mode from the
console.  I believe that version was ported by Serendipity.  However, it will
not start into queue mode.

We (as in, ISCA and the Board) have been told by Tiberius that he has a copy
that works in queue mode on a private server to which we do not have access.
Tiberius has told us, as recently as this past summer, that he has started it
up and confirmed that it appears to work.  However, the version Tiberius has,
which works, is different from the version we have, which does not work.

We have been trying without success for at least since I've been in ISCA to get
a copy of this working version from Tiberius.  Tiberius has generally assured
us that he will send the code when time permits, as his job keeps him busy, but
he has not done so yet.

ISCA has decided that we will move forward with other projects and make those
our priority, rather than continue to wait for Tiberius to send his port.  When
and if he does send it, we will resume that project, and intergrate it into the
"new" ISCA environment.  In the meantime, however, we will not hold up any
other projects waiting for the Linux port to be finished.

The majority of what folks want to see us do with ISCA -- integration with
Facebook and Twitter, threaded conversations, web interfaces -- does not
require any modification to the underlying code.  There is already an open-
protocol interface to the BBS message base, and a number of APIs already
written in various programming languages which implement that protocol, so you
don't even have to learn it.

For example, I have written a web interface that lets you read ISCA, which
updates when new messages are posted, and which organizes the forums into
topics.  I'm working on enabling posting, a friends list, and other features
not found on the BBS proper.

None of this depends on the port being completed.

Lochner> Regarding Gestalt:

1) What types of assurances does the ISCA board have that Tanj will finish
Gestalt/Raccdoc in a timely fashion? There are components that have been on the
"to do" list for awhile and while Tanj is not Tiberius, he is a business owner
who likely (and rightfully) would put his work above ISCA. It would be wise to
take some steps to at least mitigate the possibility of ending up in the same
place in a year, with the difference being that we're waiting on another single
person.

2) What kind of access to the Gestalt source will ISCA have? Will we be able to
modify/bug fix it ourselves or are we limited to an off-the-shelf product?

 Tanj's response is my understanding as well.  To respond to your
 specific questions:

"What types of assurances does the ISCA board have that Tanj will finish
Gestalt/Raccdoc in a timely fashion?"

 None.  To the extent that ISCA requires modifications to Gestalt, it is
 ISCA's responsibility to make those modifications.

"There are components that have been on the "to do" list for awhile and while
Tanj is not Tiberius, he is a business owner who likely (and rightfully) would
put his work above ISCA."

 As such, ISCA will not rely on Tanj to do any coding on Gestalt.  So long
 as Tanj is a board member, however, he will naturally assist with setting
 up Gestalt in that capacity.

"It would be wise to take some steps to at least mitigate the possibility of
ending up in the same place in a year, with the difference being that we're
waiting on another single person."

 This has been discussed within ISCA, and there is some debate as to whether
 we are setting ourselves up for the same situation.  In my opinion, we are
 not, because ISCA has access, control, and custody to the source code for
 Gestalt, whereas we do not with Tiberius's doc port.  Because we are not
 relying on Tanj for anything, he cannot be the roadblock.

"2) What kind of access to the Gestalt source will ISCA have? Will we be able
to modify/bug fix it ourselves or are we limited to an off-the-shelf product?"

 Full and uncontrolled access, the license is royalty-free, world-wide,
 perpetual, and irrevocable.  The only thing we cannot do is re-distribute
 it outside of ISCA's control.  However, we can designate Authorized
 Developers to have access to it to work on it, etc.

 The details of how the licensing agreement will work out are being
 discussed now.

The way I look at is:

  We could spend the next six months doing one of the following:

    (a) attempting to get the DOC port from Tiberius

    (b) attempting to duplicate Tiberius's DOC port

    (c) attempting to move to Gestalt

  Assuming that all three of these efforts would be successful if attempted,
  at the end of six months, with option (a) or (b), we would still be
  stuck with binary files as the underlying data storage, and we would still
  be doing option (c) at some point under the previously approved roadmap.

  Whereas, if we switched to (c), we'd have successfully migrated the data
  into a database and have accomplished the next step up on the previously
  approved roadmap.

  I also think that the odds of these being successful, ordered from highest
  odds to lowest, are (c), (b), and then (a).  So, I advocated for option (c),
  believing it to have the following benefits:

    (1) dislodge the current porting log jam
    (2) accomplish a milestone already present in the roadmap
    (3) get us off HP-UX
    (4) get us off of binary storage of the database
    (5) have the highest likelihood of success

  The worse case scenario is that we get six months down the road and have
  gotten nowhere.  Oh well.  What's the difference between that, and continuing
  to ask Tiberius for code or trying to debug DOC, and getting nowhere?

  At least we're trying something.

The reason for the vote is twofold:

1. Our bylaws require it (a legal issue)
2. Attempt to bar disruptive individuals

#2 is not foolproof, either. In the past one individual was given the
benefit of the doubt, and acted out even worse in I S C A>.  On the other
hand, other folks who had a history as "problem users" have joined ISCA
and haven't caused any problems beyond perhaps a little too much clowning
around (I include myself, Ace High, and CL in that category) at times.

On another note. . .

It is true that ISCA has stagnated while we waited on one person for a tar
file, but now we're forging ahead on a different path rather than naively
continuing to wait. It's not like there is a lot going on all the time,
even when progress is being made. I expect it would be more active in the
near future as we bang out requirements,  functional specifications, and
testing, and perhaps update the web site (and maybe integrate it with
Gestalt at some level - who knows?) and rewrite helpfiles to install in
the new environment, but in the meantime if you join you get to see just
how much excitement there isn't.

Square's transaction fees are LOWER than PayPal's unless you get a discounted
merchant rate by paying a monthly fee.

Square's 2.75% flat fee with no "swipe" fee is currently the best deal going
for someone who needs to accept credit cards only occasionally.

That said, Square pretty much requires that you have the physical card to swipe
it and get the flat rate. If you just have the number, you're looking at 3.5% +
15 cents per transaction. It's really made for card-present payments.

possibly 'hdfs' (hadoop fs). if it's not too much, i'd like to get ~10 posts

convincing me that ceph was the way to go - i think he was right, i mainly want

so, i've pretty much decided on the underlying config - freebsd, zraid 5.

what i want on the network end is a raid5 type storage so that i can unplug a
server and not notice anything. i want this mainly to run virtual machines. i
would like everything to be redundant and scalable (including the metadata and
controller / master / whatever if one is needed).

i know that gluster doesn't care what i'm running it on. however, gluster only
*does* striping and (i don't remember what they call it) cloning. so, raid
0/1/10 - no parity.

from what i've read of hadoop, i can store files on it, but you need to go
through hadoop to access it. so, if i wanted to export a file for iscsi or 
nfs,
i've got to figure out how to write a tie in (read code) for hadoop <-> iscsi
or hadoop <-> nfs. i would assume someone has done this (probably a fuse
module?) but i haven't found anything....?

What I was looking at specifically for VM's was iSCSI (which we also have) and
a Marvell dragonfly with SSD's on the VM Servers for high speed, caching.

eliminates the slowness of iSCSI, reduces the costs of the storage space, and

Bigger in the moment, because FSU was a top-5 team?  Sure.  But there were no
long-term ramifications that arose from that game.

UL's win over Alabama was their first bowl win in 33 years.  It gave them their
first EVER season of double-digit wins.  In the 17 seasons prior to 1990, UL
had only one year of even 8 wins.  They finished #14 in the AP, their highest
ranking ever in a year-ending AP poll (kept that until 2004).

Since that game, they have 6 conference championships, 13 bowl appearanes, 6
bowl wins, 4 seasons of 10+ wins, and a move from "nobody" independent to
mid-major conference to coveted member of a BCS conference.

The political issues surrounding the 1991 Fiesta Bowl, which I am not disputing
or discounting, do not change any of this.

I understand that you have an infantile need to be contrary and throw your $.02
in when they're not needed or asked for, in a vain attempt to look superior...
but c'mon, you can do better.

As for the whole motivation thing...again, you just have to be contrary to the
point of idiocy.  Do you REALLY believe that players on opposing teams are
equally motivated in every single game, or that players on a given team are are
equally motivated every single week, or that motivation plays ZERO role in the
product that a given team puts on the field in a given week?

If you believe any (or all) of that, I've got some "land" to sell you.

Players are not automatons.  The peaks and valleys of their emotional,
psychological and physical states all have a direct impact on their physical
ability to perform.

I suppose you don't believe that, when teams struggle to win (or lose outright)
in a game following a huge upset or a tough rivalry game, it has nothing to do
with an "emotional letdown" -- a phenomenon cited often in the media when such
things happen.  (should read "you believe", not "you don't believe")

Heh.  If physical talent and ability is the only thing that matters, why even
play the games?  You should be able to determine winners on paper.

(And if I'm Mark May, then you're Lou Holtz.  And if that's the case, I
win...oh, do I ever win.)

Yeah that's the standard rule in college for that scenario though, but it's a
little different if you're going for a 2 point conversion, the other team
intercepts it, runs out of the endzone and then goes back into the endzone and
gets tackled, like what happened in the game last night. My guess, and i could
be wrong is that, either way it's only worth 1 point. I'm guess that the
scenario that Archmage is asking about is even more rare than the one that
happened last night. I'd be interested to find out the answer to Archmages
question though. I wonder if that scenario has ever actually happened

Yes, a safety on a 2 point conversion would still be only 1 point.  Section 8,
Rule 1 of the NCAA rulebook says that point values for a try are: 2 for a
touchdown (offense gets ball in end zone on a 2 point play or fake/botched PAT)
OR 1 for a successful PAT or a safety.

The interesting thing here is that, in the NCAA, the defense can also get a 1
point safety on a try.  obviously, this would almost certainly never happen --
the kicking team would have to get tackled in their own end zone, 97 yards
away.  The most likely way would be via a blocked kick or turnover on a 2 point
play that was returned to near the other goalline and fumbled.  The team making
the try would then have to recover and be tackled in their own end zone.

Regardless, thanks to this quirky rule, it IS possible for a losing team to
finish a game with just 1 point...at least in the NCAA, anyway.

*laughs*  I love it when you resort to name calling, kinda like the BBS
equivilant of the classic Cicero quote.

Anyway, the 1990 Louisville team was one I studied at length at the time.  THey
played 11 regular season games, finished 9-1-1.  Of their 9 wins, all were
against teams that had losing records (including WKU and Murray St), they only
played two teams with winning records, losing to S. Miss and tying San Jose St
from the Big West.  In those days proceeding the arranged marriage process of
bowl placement, UL was sweating even getting a bowl bid.  They fact the Fiesta
was able to get them so late in the process shows how desperate the bowl was
for a team.  Same for Ala, considering in 1990 there were only about half the
number of bowl games there are today.  As I said earlier, the games was called
the "Bigot Bowl" for good reason.  No doubt at the time beating a mediocre Ala
was a big win for UL, beating any team with a winning record in any bowl would
have been a big win for UL.  The biggest in school history?  No.

The point is, you are the ultimate SEC homer.  When an SEC teams wins, it's
because they are from the best conference in the nation.  When they lose,
you've always got some silly excuse, like they didn't want to be there, were
disinterested, or didn't take the opponent seriously.  I don't have a problem
with homers, most I actually respect for undying loyality to their respective
teams.  On the other hand, most of them don't try to blow smoke up my ass by
trying to act objective.

ESPN Classic this evening showed the original broadcast of the ND v. Ala 1973
Sugar Bowl.  I remember watching that game as a high school senior, but it's
amazing what one notices seeing the broadcast years later.  The thing that
stood out to me today was the lack of broadcast technology we've all grown use
to.  No super-imposed, yellow first down line, no constant showing of the
game/play clock or times outs remaining, limited use of instant replay (and
when used from only, maybe two angles), very primitive graphics, and no creeper
at the screen bottom giving other scores or information.

Technology aside, other aspects of the game were very eye-catching.  Not once
did a receiver jump up after missing a catch gesturing for a pass inteference
flag.  There were members of the Ala staff on the sidelines smoking cigarettes.
There was little-to-no celebrations by individual players after big plays, and
there didn't appear to be a lot of trash talking.  In fact, players on both
teams often helped opponents to their feet and slapped them on the butt.  At
the start of the 4th qtr, an Ala defender got knocked out colder than a
mackerel.  He was back in the game maybe ten minutes later.  And yes, many on
the sidelines and in the stands were dressed in groovy, Greg Brady-esk attire,
lots of strips and plaid.

Ultimate SEC homer?

Have I posted in here with excuses for why LSU lost to essentially the same
Clemson team that got rocked by West Virginia last year?  Or for why
Mississippi State became the first Northwestern bowl victim in more than a
half-century?  Or why South Carolina needed a last-second pass to beat a 4-loss
Michigan team?

Nope.

Do I post in here with diatribes about how poor officiating costs the SEC
winsor about unfairness of processes when they ever hurt SEC teams?

Nope.

All I did was make a comment about how Florida appeared to be disinterested and
that said disinterest clearly affected their level of play -- while ALSO noting
that Louisville might have beaten Florida, even if Florida had played their top
game.

And the crime, apparently, is that I made the same comment four years ago about
Alabama.

If that's the extent of my SEC "homer-ism", then I think that I can safely look
at myself in the mirror.

But fine...if you need this to be your little security blanket, I'll give it to
you: if Alabama loses tomorrow night, I will make ZERO excuses.  Zip.  Zilch. 
Nada.

Will you do the same if Alabama wins?

"Essentially the same team as last year" in college is actually pretty good,
I'd think. It means the same players, but with a year more conditioning,
experience, and practice working together. It means you're not replacing
graduating seniors with freshmen or underclassmen. (There's the old trope how
if they were better, they'd be starting.) I mean, sure, occasionally, you get a
new player who comes out like gangbusters, and sure, occasionally players get
worse the next year, but I'd think that in general, teams would want to keep
players from a team--even an underachieving team--rather than lose them and
have to replace them.

*shrug*  Whichever team wins, wins.  I don't make excuses for teams, but will
make observations.  The difference is in not having a compelling
interest/loyality in one team vice another.  That's not to say I don't have
teams I root for/against, but I'm objective about teams/games because of my
wagering background.  If Ala loses as a result of poor officiating, I can say
that without any hesitation.

The irony is I'm actually a big Ala fan, although admittedly I don't think much
of St. Nick.  When my Mom passed away several years ago, I surprised to find
she'd saved my Johnny Musso poster and a full-page photo of Bear Bryant I cut
out if SI.  I also still have several Ala shirts, maybe even a hat, I bought
over the years during numerous trips to lovely Dothan.  I never let the fact I
was a fan of Ala, or any other team for that matter, sway my analysis when
predicting winners.  Still don't...
\
By the way, I'm taking Ala to beat ND in a close game that I think will be
higher scoring than most predict.  Ala is deeper, has both players and coaches
who've played in NC games before, and has markedly better special teams than
ND.  Watch how well Ala pass blocks against a vert good ND front seven, All is
55th in the nation in sacks allowed.  Conversely, ND will need to get enough
rushing yards from Golson to keep the Ala defense off balance.  Since Saban has
been at Ala, his teams have lost most of their games to teams with QBs who can
run (Tebow, Jefferson, Manziel, Newton, Johnson).  If ND has to play Rees at
QB, either because Golson is hurt or ineffective, the game will get out of
hand.

I've got no problem saying that I'm an Alabama fan -- but there's a difference
between a fan and a "homer".  I'll criticize the teams I cheer for all day
long, if they deserve it.

But I've got no particular rooting interest in the rest of the SEC.  For
instance, I pulled for Michigan over South Carolina and Oklahoma over A&M.  The
league as a whole?  Perhaps, but it is what it is.

Anyway, I'm going to refrain from any kind of prediction about tomorrow
night...but I'll be very interested to see if Alabama reprises their game plan
from last year's title game, especially with a banged up Barrett Jones playing
against a stout ND defensive line.

I liked that game plan -- I'm a fan of run-oriented teams trying to loosen up
opposing defenses with the pass early -- but McCarron has struggled against
better defenses this year.  So...we'll see.

A few weeks ago I had Bama winning something like 30-17. (In fact, it may be

But now I have a sneaking suspicion about Notre Dame. There's a fight
in this team (no pun intended) that makes me think they will give us a better
challenge that we anticipated.  Not to mention that I think Bama may have
been buying into their own hype a little too much.

I say Notre forces two big turnovers that make the difference in the game.

Tonight's game was nothing more than Alabama's offensive line taking Notre
Dame's front 7 out behind t woodshed and beating the absolute shit out of them.

I wasn't completely enamored with Notre Dame's game plan on offense, but they
could have moved the ball.  That first Alabama TD drive, though, put the Irish
on their heels, and the offense got caught up in that.  By the time they got
really comfortable, the game was already over.

On the two early controversial calls by the officials...I though the first was
a catch, although it could have gone either way and I don't think replay could
have overtned it either way.  On the muffed punt, the officials could have
handled it better.  The fair catch call was late...but the penalty was correct.
You don't have to contact the returner -- you must give him a yard in front so
he can make the catch (sides don't matter).  And, if the punt is muffed, you
have to give him a chance to regain control (until the ball hits the ground).

Anyway...I'll be fascinated to see who Alabama loses from its underclassmen. 
They'll have to replace some guys, like Barrett Jones, as seniors...and some
guys (Eddie Lacy?) might leave, but they have McCarron, Cooper and Yeldon all
coming back.  Their offense could be very, very good in 2013.

Alabama opens their 2013 schedule with a game vs Virginia Tech in Atlanta on
August 31st.  After an idle week, they play at College Station against Texas
A&M on September 14th.  That game should be absolutely epic -- and it's early
enough in the season that, if both teams are as good as they should be, a
rematch is definitely possible next January in Pasadena.

Think about these things:

SEC has won 7 straight BCS championship games.  SEC teams (5 of them) are 9-1
in 10 BCS title game appearances -- and the only loss was in an SEC vs SEC
game.  All other conferences combined have 6 BCS titles, and none have more
than 2.

The state of Alabama has won the last 4 BCS titles (Alabama 3, Auburn 1). 
Alabama itself, obviously, has won 3 of the last 4.

Nick Saban is now 61-7 in the last 5 years at Alabama.
 -- He has 3 BCS championships, 2 SEC championships, 5 straight top ten
finishes (AP), four straight bowl wins, and a 24-1 record against
non-conference opponents.  Sabam has won 20 straight now outside of the SEC,
with his only loss in the last 5 years coming in the 2009 Sugar Bowl vs Utah.

  Well that game wasn't that much of a surprise at all to me.  I knew Bama was
going to blow out ND.  What was a bit surprising was looking at the new top 10
and how Ohio State is represented in the AP and the USA polls.  USA opting to
not rank them (since they were ineligible for bowl), but AP keeping them at #3.

  So obviously they would have gone to the Championship and if they lost they
would have been at #3.  So with that, the SEC has 1/2 of the top 10, PAC-12 has
2 and the Big 10 has only 1 and their only 1 represented team was under
sanctions and didn't even participate in a bowl game.

  I expected at least to have another Big 10 team in the Big 10 this year, but
the entire conference really didn't up hold their past reputations.

  Hell the AP at least has Michigan and Nebraska, with the USA not even having
those two in there.  That's pretty bad for the Big 10...

As for AJ McCarron, he'll be a 5th year senior in the 2013-14 season.  He
redshired in his first year, then sat behind Greg McElroy in 2010 as a redshirt
freshman.  He has started in both his sophomore and junior seasons.

As a starter, McCarron is 25-2.  If you include his redshirt season, he has
more championship rings at Alabama than career losses.  Wrap your head around

yeah, if there was a take-away from the season it was that the SEC power
schools had monster defenses and inconsistent offenses.
If there was a scouting report on Notre Dame it was that it's defense was the
real star of the show at least against who they played, even if the teams they
played didn't pan out to be all to great ( not even Oklahoma, USC or UofM
turned out to be as good as many thought they'd be.).

Going into last nights game, you knew ND would need to play a great game. You
also knew Alabama would need to succomb to this supposedly great defense.

Neither of those happened. We know Alabama could run the ball but they seemed
to pass at will too.

Wait...what, KAM?  Mediocre?

I do not think that word means what you think it means.

Excluding their games with LSU, A&M, Georgia and Notre Dame, Alabama won 10
games by an AVERAGE score of 42.3 to 6.5.  They never scored fewer than 33 or
allowed more than 14 in any of those games.  Those included FOUR shutouts.

Even if you include the Notre Dame game, that average score only changes to
42.3-7.2.

I'd hardly call that "mediocre".  Maybe the opponents were, but what more can
you do than win by an average of 5 TDs every week?

Winning by 4 in possibly the most difficult environment in all of college
football (at Baton Rouge on a Saturday night) is hardly medicore.  LSU's only
other losses this year were at 11-2 Florida and against 11-2 Clemson in a bowl,
by a combined 9 points.

Winning by 4 in a conference championship game against Georgia, in UGA's
backyard of Atlanta, is also hardly mediocre.  Georgia's only other loss this
year was at night against 11-2 South Carolina when it still had Marcus
Lattimore.  Both UGA and SC finished in the final AP top 10.

And losing at home to 11-2 Texas A&M by less than a TD, when that team is
quarterbacked by the Heisman Trophy winner, is hardly mediocre...when that team
ended up destroying Oklahoma in their bowl game.  Their final record of 11-2
included losses only to 11-2 Florida and 10-3 LSU...by a combined 8 points.

You can say a lot of things about Alabama...but "they played mediocre for most
of the season" is NOT one of them.

Of the 12 losses among those six teams, TEN of them came withn their own little
group.  That's right -- the rest of the country beat the six teams a combined
TWO times this year, and both of those came in bowl games (Lousiville vs
Florida, Clemson vs LSU).

And if you want to include 9-4 Vanderbilt...3 of THEIR losses came against the
above 6 teams.  They only lost once outside that group, to Northwestern, who
won a bowl game of their own.

Overall, those 7 teams (incl. Vandy) went 13-13 against each other and 64-3

At first I thought you MIGHT be trolling.  Now I'm sure of it.

Their scores at HALFTIME vs all opponents except LSU, A&M and Georgia:

31-7, 21-0, 24-0, 30-0, 27-7, 28-7, 23-10, 24-0, 42-0, 42-0, 28-0.

That's an AVERAGE halftime score of 29.2 to 2.8 -- for an AVERAGE halftime lead
of 4 TDs.  Only one game (at Tennessee) was even remotely in doubt at
halftime...and Alabama won that by 31 points.

As for the other 3 games...I'd argue that LSU and Georgia "struggled" as much
as Alabama in those two contests.  And yes, Alabama had a poor first quarter
against A&M...then outscored them 24-9 for the remainder of the game.  So...

It was apparent the ND defense was in trouble midway through the first qtr when
the only time you heard the names of ND's best defensive players mentioned was
in reference to either missing a tackle or getting dinged up.  I don't think I
heard Tuitt's name mentioned the entire night, except for one play when he
forced a pass to be thrown out of bounds.

Ala depth and experience in this level of game were apparent.  THey also did
what no other team had done to ND this years, expose a weak, underamnned
secondar, especially the corners.  UP to this game ND had been able to play
their safeties deep to help protect inexperienced corners.  Onve the safties
had to start cheating up for run support, the ND corners were toast.

ND's offensive game plan was puzzling.  They never really tried to establish
the run, their strength this past season with three good running backs with
three different styles.  Also didn't try to take advantage matching up Riddick
on LBs as they did all year, or put in called running plays for Golson.  It
seemed to me Kelly decided he was going to do what A&M and, to a lesser extent,
what LSU had done despite the fact those offensive game plans didn't really
match the things ND had done well offensively all season.

The altercation between the Ala QB and center near the end of the game was an
embarrassment.  McCarron showing up his center was just plain stupid, not sure
I blame the kid for physically getting him out of his face.  Years ago I was at
an Eastern Mich game where two defensive players fir whoever it was EMU was
playing got into a shouting match after a long gainer.  Finally one of them
tackled the other and they had to be separated.  They got hit with an
"unsportsman-like conduct" penalty and the aggressor got thrown out of the
game.  Have never again seen an incident where a player was penalized for an
on-field foul against a teammate.

Also embarrassing was Musburger's on-air drooling over McCarron's girl friend.
I was waiting for him to say he'd like to sniff her bicycle seat.  Very
unprofessional, but I suppose it could have been worse (or better, depending on
how you look at it).  Marv Albert could have been calling the game.

Calhoun>  It is what it is, but after the game, an Alabama player said that
Boston College had pushed ND around, so the Tide players knew they would be
able to, as well.

As for the McCarron-Jones flap, the players are roommates and friends.  Second
of all, they're passionate and have been in Saban's system for four years. 
Musberger or Herbie (I forget which) described it as a "lover's quarrel", and I
guess that's not really off.

Criticism of that seems to me to be as off-base as criticism of Saban for
saying that he takes a day or 2 to enjoy the win and then begins work on next
year.

One huge reason why Saban has been able to put together teams that have won 4
national championships in his last 8 seasons in college is because he and hsi
players refuse to back down and stop caring...even when they're up 42-14, even
when they've won a national championship.  You could see it after the 2009
title -- Saban's players pulled back.  They were complacent.

That didn't happen in this title defense.  Outside of one quarter against Texas
A&M, Alabama was generally a relentless steamroller this year...almost never
letting up.  And who are the leaders on this team?  McCarron and Jones, who
have both been there from 2009 til now.

The relentless passion of those players and of Saban is why Alabama has become
what it is.  It's why they've won 3 titles in 4 years...and why they're
currently a Vegas favorite to make it 4 in 5 years next January.

You call it an embarrassment?  That's fine.  I'm sure all the jewelry owned by
McCarron and Jones will soothe that pain.

On to a someone/something worth discussing seriously, I'm wondering how fans
and the media will approach the 2013 season considering the following year will
start the play-off system.  I'm guessing 2013 will wind up being the proverbial
"lost season" in anticiaption of a play-off.  The current BCS system would end
perfectly if a year from today we have a split NC.  Still haven't heard how
the AP will play under the play-off system, my guess is they will still reserve
the right to name their own champ, it will just be tougher for them to name a
champ differing from the play-off champ.

Some polls might name any undefeated team that didn't get into the playoff,
as a national champ. Especially if that National Champ has a loss.

When you look at wikipedia,for NCAA football champions its always fun to see
which team got named national champion by some of th eminor polls, from yea to
year.

If so many experts felt Alabama was better than ND before the NC title game,
why wasn't Alabama the number 1 team in the AP poll before the NC title game?

Well, it looks like we can add Brian Kelly to the list of totally unethical
college football coaches, along with the likes of St. Nick, Franchione, and
Petrino.  Just last week he was quoted as saying he had no interest in the NFL,
that he was where he wanted to be.  So a couple days after getting his ass
kicked, he's in Philly interviewing for the Eagles's job.  Add this to his
repeated lies while at UC about the ND job establishes the kind of man he is. 
If I'm ND, I fire his ass, just like BC did a few back when their coach tried
to leave them high and dry.  Hopefully he winds up at some piss ant school just
like Franchione and Petrino.

So, you don't think it's possible that when he gave that interview last week
that he was not interested? Perhaps something changed since Monday night, aside
from the asskicking?

Maybe a bunch of boosters made it known that they wanted Kelly out? Maybe the
AD said he wasn't satisfied? Maybe he didn't know that the Eagles were
interested in him? Or maybe he turned them down before and they came back with
a sweetheart deal, and he didn't think they'd be serious? Perhaps he's just
entertaining their offer to see what it might be like if he decides to leave ND
one day?

Look, an interview is just that, an interview. It could lead to more, but
that's an awful lot of assumption. If fans and critics could just keep that in
perspective, coaches wouldn't have to lie and make statements saying that
they're staying put when in reality they'd like to explore their options, and
every coach most certainly deserves to do that, just like any other employee in
any other job.

I don't know how coaches _should_ answer those questions.

What if y ou got asked this question, in public about your job, knowing that
whatever you say will get reported:

"Would you leave your job if someone offered more money and a better
situation for you , personally?"

For many, you can't just say yes, because there are many consequences to that.
You could be fired by your current employer. You could strain relationships
with your current co-workers, and you actually like working there.
You might piss off recruits even though you didn't actually leave.


One coach said it kinda best
"I am happy where I am but anyone would be a fool to not learn about
other oppurtunities."

So let's say that Calhoun hires Nick Saban and gives him that defined protocol

I'd say there would probably be several dozen schools lined up to woo him,
while Calhoun deals with a pissed off fan base, recruits that want to leave,
and players that want to transfer.

Winning and ethics aren't completely divorced...but they're not exactly getting

Actually the "no comment" is simply saying "I'm not going to talk about that
issue."  If you or some media numbnuts decides that asnwer equates to "I'll
leave when I feel the money is rights", that's up to you since coach clearly
didn't say it.  It that's how you interpret no comment, so be it.  It's, in
effect, exactly what it is, a refusal to discuss a topic.  I'm sure there are
spin doctors  who find a way to make "no comment" as damning as a murder
suspect taking the fifth.

And what of a coach like St Nick, Petrino, Frachione, and apparrently now Kelly
who has flat out lied in the past.  If I was an Alabama player, and St NIck
called a team meeting to say he had no plans to move on, why would I believe
him anymore that Petrino, Franchione, Kelly, or the new face of sleeziness,
Todd Grahmn.  As as old General I worked for used to say, "We've already
established the kind of people we are, and the kind we're dealing with."

Playing contractual hardball with coaches as I proposed is going to work 95% of
the time.  What of the other 5%, that's reserved for the guys like St Nike who
knows passsed on his past winning record, they'll have no problem getting no
only a job, but a good job.  HOw many coaches are there currently in college
football who could resign and be assured he had a quality billet the following
season?  Franchione is  at Texas St, Petrino at WKU, Bowden is at Akron, Price
wound up at UTEP ("Roll Tide"), Gill at DIAA Liberty.  You send the average
coach packing, his career is going to take a step backward.

When a player verbally commits to a school, then signs with someone else, do we
call him a liar?

When a player says that he's going to stay at a school, no matter what, then
chooses to transfer out for a better opportunity, do we criticize him?

When a player indicates that he wants to stay in school and finish his
education, then bolts for the NFL Draft when his stock is at its highest, do we
question his integrity?

There are still far too many who hold athletes and coaches to some weird higher
moral and ethical standard, as if those people are not real people because of
their status.

People are going to act like people.  I can't speak for anyone else, but I

Yes, there are many who feel the NCAA needs to either put some teeth in the
verbal committment or do away with it altogether.  As it is now, it actually
helps other teams hoping to sign (as in "on the dotted line") a recruit as it
allows them to focus their negative recruiting an a specific team.

There are penalties involved currently for transferring. A player must either
drop to a lower level of competetion or sit out a year (if a release is
granted) or two (if a release isn't granted).  There are also rules in place
prohibiting how/when schools can communicate with a potential transfer.

Declaring for the draft is a tougher nut to crack, although it's gotten better
over the years with the agreement between the NCAA and NFL to give guys ah
honest appraisal of their NFL draft value.  The real problem here is there
isn't much you can do about a kid quitting school, whether he's an athlete or
not.  Note, you don't see a coach quit with zero assurance he'll have a new job
the way kids declaring for the draft do.

Another one of those generational things I guess, I don't consider expecting
anyone, regardless of their station in life or profession, to have personal
integrity to be "weird".

Yeah, the whole thing doesn't make much sense.

The more I try to wrap my head around it, the more I lean towards the idea that
BOTH angles are true.

Originally, it WAS a hoax -- Te'o did get catfished.

But by the time he figured it out, the story was big in the national media, and
he continued with it rather than suffer the embarrassment that would come with
exposure of the hoax.

I don't know...I just have a hard time believing that Te'o and his family could
manufacture all of this by themselves (or wuld want to), but I also have a hard
time believing that he's as stupid as one would have to be to have never
figured this out.

Miami Allegations. It looks like the NOA will be released to the public at any
time but this is what I am hearing about the NCAA investigation.Various sources
are saying that the University beleives that the NCAA has been very fair and
that it looks like the main targets will be those coaches who had involvelemnt
and no LOIC will be alledged. They are saying that the brunt off tuff will be
laid on Haith ( who is the head coach at Missouri) and Aubrey Hill  ( I am not
sure where he is now. It looks like there will be no additional bowl bans but
football scholarships will be lost. They are saying that a resolution might be
long because the University will challeges some things such as the NCAA taking
the word of Shapiro the convicted felon with skimpy corroboration. God I hope
that what I am hearing is accurateto that I can rub it in TBB's face since he
was SURE that Miami wold get nailed to the wall :)

Listened to Mike & Mike this morning and it really bothered me how they were so
incredulous that Te'o did not have a whole stable of girlfriends at Norte Dame
and did not party with the rest of the team.
They seem to be forgetting that he is Mormon and Samoan. Mormon Samoans don't
party, and they don't date outside of other Mormon Samoans. Combine this with
him having a high GPA at Norte Dame and doing tons of volunteer work, and an
online girlfriend plus his relative lack of social life makes a lot of sense.
Everyone assumes that college football players just party constantly and have
women throwing themselves at them. Reality is a lot of college athletes,
including football players, are social hermits who are a bit more vulnerable to
getting sucked into online relationships as a result.

I was wondering when/if the media was going to bring up the fact Te'o was a
Mormon and how the tenets of the faith, especially those dealing with
relationships and pre-marital sex, tended to support his claims of naive
innocence.  I've been meaning to see how the papers in SLC/Utah are covering
this story.

The puzzling thing is still not having a motive for the scam.  Blackmail seems
unlikey, but a good, old fashioned fleecing of someone so apparently trusting
might still make sense, that is if Te'o and his family were people of means. 
They are not.  The scheme seems too elaborate to have just been a joke, even a
very cruel joke.  A personal vendetta perhaps?  We know Te'o pissed off a lot
of people when he ditched USC for ND, and the girl did allegedly live in CA.

The girl whose picture was used was interviewed on one of the nightly tabloid
shows, she claims to have no knowledge of the scam, nor to have ever spoken to
Te'o.  She's innocent until proven guility, although it's doubtful any law
enforcement agency is even looking into the situation unless there is clear
criminal activity, or at least intent.  Civil action would seem more likely,
although Te'o would probably prefer the story just went away.

The writer in me would love to see some retired Irish-American bunco detective
from Boston, hired by a group of ND subway alums, investigate the story.  In
fact I already have a couple ideas for such a book, but fiction was never my
longsuit.  Too bad Robert Parker died, would have made a great "Spenser" novel.

without him catching on until the very end.  And I'm definitely on board with
the "how can you call her your girlfriend if you've never met her" crew.

I mean, I'm not THAT old.  I've been around ISCA from the early days, I know
how the online dating thing used to be compared to how it is now.  But naive
innocence or not, it's still just really fucked up.  Not necessarily that
people could get "catfished", but that someone could keep the ruse on THIS
LONG.

And then there's still the matter of all these statements from the past that
CLEARLY conflict with the idea that he never met this fake girlfriend in
person.  Maybe those were just embellishments, or maybe the perp went THAT far
and actually had someone play a role in person...I don't know.  But until those
questions get answered, I'm sticking with the belief that he was duped but
found out about it way before this December.

The whole thing got even more bizarre last night.  Te'o finally decided to do
an interview with jeremy Schaap of ESPN.  (Schaap is the son of Dick Schaap and
is very respected as a journalist.)

Te'o had his lawyer/spokesman in the room and refused to be filmed -- he only
allowed pictures.  Further, while the audio was recorded, he only consented to
a limited amount for release to the public.

Schaap seemed to think that Te'o was composed, confident and believable.  But
Te'o copped to embellishing the story to the media out of fear of
embarrrassment over what was really going on.

And then, he apparently said that he wasn't 100% sure that the whole thing was
a hoax until WEDNESDAY (the day Deadspin broke the story), when Tuiasosopo
contacted him (DM, phone, who knows) to admit it and apologize.  There's no
indication if this happened before or after Deadspin posted their piece.

That last part may be the most bizarre thing yet, and it completely blows away
the timeline presented by Notre Dame.

This kid is some combination of dangerously naive and stupid (dangerous to
himself).  Someone better get to him fast and straighten him out, or he's going
to ruin his own draft stock or get bilked out of every penny he makes in the

Stupidity and niavette aside, still haven't heard a motive for this scam. 
Clearly Tuiasosopo is a Polyneisan/Samoan names, and also the family name of at
least a couple former USC football players.  For all I know, that name might be
as common in Polynesia as "Smith" is here, but it could lead back to the anger
many USC followers displayed when Te'o opted for ND over USC at the 11th hour.
Could also be a personal vendetta resulting from some dispute between Samoan
families.

Have yet to hear anyone talk about the possiblities of criminal charges out of
this thing, as I said before I don't know that there was any criminal intent. 
Civil action is still possible I suppose, but Te'o would have to prove how he
was damaged (as in equating his humiliation to a dollar value).  Even if he
opted to do that, which I doubt, not sure he'd get a very accomodating jury is
SC land.

I told him "oh I understand" I was caught off guard from his comment.  I have

might be because we can not find any male staff for that home.  It has really
gotten to me. My depression is really bad. Like seriously bad. I haven't been
the same for a while now.

How do I let the boss know that this has effected me.  We have a close working
relationship and we do work well together.  I don't want to go to HR about it
because I think of our work relationship too much and I don't want to make
things hard between us.

You had me up until the last line.  It's not harassment, it is discrimination
based on the OP's weight and the boss is being an ass.

Setting the kid up for a sex-related charge because the women helping him are
attractive?  Seriously?  How the heck are you getting from point A to point B
on that one?

It could also be the OP's attitude (I can't see the work situation).  If the
other women are happy and bubbly, that'd be a positive influence.  I'm not
suggesting that depression isn't a serious problem, but if that comes through
in working with the child, that'd be a negative influence and could by why he
considers the OP "not a good fit."  It may have nothing to do with her weight.

Nope the depression is not noticeable. I work very well with all my other kids.
It was very clear that because I was not "hot" that I can't work with that kid.
I am very bubbly and cheerful working with my kids. I work in many other homes
and I have had nothing but Great feedback from parents and the kids.
This is clearly that I am not 'hot' enough to work with this kid, and I found
it to be extremly offensive that the boss said this.  Problem is I shrugged it
off when he said it, thinking I'd get over it but now I am starting my anorexic
behaviors again, which yeah great I will lose the weight, but this isn't
healthy.  When I worked in the office after this I have been very sad.  I am
very good at putting on the happy hat when I work with my kids and nobody knows
any different. Trust me I have put on the happy hat my entire life and it is
very difficult for outsiders to see the pain inside. I show my pain at HOME not
at work.

I can't jump to discrimination, though, either. I've done consulting work in
groups where the fit of consultant to client is based on numerous factors. Area
of itnerest, personality, expertise, background, process knowledge, or just
style. I would imagine a boss who says "you aren't the right fit" for this
"client" could have been referencing all kinds of things, and not necessarily
weight. It's a big jump to get to the hot factor without a whole lot of other
information and explicit statements.
As an example, you didn't mention it, but let's say this is a group of 5 female
consultants, you are one of them. You said you are overweight - the other 4
could be model slim and totally sexy. Then any work routed to them would fit
the pattern of "he put a hot chick on it and not a heavy chick". There may not
have been another option. I doubt that's the situation, but there's a lot of
other explinations before we get to malicious and unlawful.
That said, it smells like a bad situation for the details you provided, and
there's something possibly going on. Then again, it's useful to step back and
acknowledge you only have on perspective on it and might be missing all kinds
of information that create an entirely different picture.

In that case, OP, I'd have to go with your assessement that he's being
insensitive.  I don't know what recourse you'd have, though, if your working
relationship is otherwise swimming.

"He called me fat."
"Oh?  What did he say?  When did this happen?"
"Well, he has hot chicks working with this one kid and said I can't."
"So when did he call you fat, exactly?"
"Well, I mean..."
"Please be in touch if you have more to report."
"*sigh*"

I'm just not sure that even if you were to go to HR, that anything would
actually happen.  You could just be frank with him and say something like,
"You know, I realize that I'm overweight and I suspect this is why I'm not
able to work with Soandso.  While I understand your goals for this child,
it's hurtful to me and deeply disappointing that my weight is being treated as
an obstacle to *our* goal of helping this kid."

Ok let me back up.  Earlier that day we were in a meeting and it was mention
that they placed a particular girl on this case because she is 'hot' yes that

I guess at this point, how the hell do I fix this problem as after he said the

I'd say it's likely both.  Harassment when your boss called the other worker
"hot" and discrimination when he said you weren't a good fit (assuming your
looks are the reason).

Whether any of it's actionable or not sounds like it's moot since it sounds
like you aren't looking to take action.

I'll also throw this out there because it seems relevant.  Your boss may not
have even consciously connected the two pieces you've given us in his head.  He
said the previous worker was "hot" and then later said you weren't a good fit.
If he knew how these two bits might come together to make you feel insulted, he
may have avoided doing so.  Sometimes people--men in particular--are just
oblivious.

If you feel like you need to talk to him about it, just come clean with him.
Don't specifically say "harassment" or "discrimination" but mention how his
comments, together, made you feel.  I don't expect you'll get much out of it
other than confirmation of what I just said in the above paragraph, but he
might (possibly) be a little more careful with what he says to you in the
future.

Sorry, that's not what I was trying convey. I meant that since it's neither

By `move on`, I meant don't dwell on it. Some people are jerks and some people

Of course it's all going to come back to "you're fat and not good enough,"
because that's *exactly* what you said he's implying with his comments.  You
asked, basically, "is my boss calling me fat and not good enough a case of
harassment or discrimination?"  The entire discussion here will, by matter of
necessity, revolve around that question.

Take a step back and read the actual advice that's been posted (granted, not
much since there's not much here that stands out as egregious).  No one is
*calling* you fat and not good enough, that's your *assumption* based on your
manager's comments.  We're on a text based BBS here and no one can see you.  No
one can form any judgement about you based on your size.  That's all in your

Not necessarily.  I know it's hard to see a situation where the "hot" and "no
offense" comments are unrelated, at least on a conscious level, but it's
possible.

If you talk to him about it, be aware that the result could work the other way
just as easily.  If he confirms that this is the reason he didn't want you to
work with this kid, it could just make you feel worse.  And if you're not ready
to take it to the next level, it could be a lot of unnecessary pain.  It might
just be better to assume his comments were not meant to be insulting and let
time do the healing.  Water under the bridge.

Ditto what Marigolds said. Way too many people either sit and stew about things
 or think their only options are to go yo HR, a lawyer, etc over things like
this when the best starting place is often (not always) a simple conversation
between two people. You said that you generally have a good working
relationship with your boss. If that is the case, he would probably feel
horrible of he realized what he thought was an inconsequential comment had such
an impact on you.

And he may also have had a completely different rationale than what your are
inferring, even though the inference you are making is perfectly reasonable
from your perspective. He deserves a chance to explain that if he did, and you
deserve a chance to explain how you understood it and how it impacted you.

It could also lead to a conversation about what is really in this kid's
interest. He is going to have to work with, deal with, and probably be in
reationships with women of all types of appearance. It is probably best for him
to start learning to like, work with, and relate to women whose attractiveness
comes in many different forms rather than just being exposed to women who meet
his juvenile idea of "hot."

Thanks for the input. It is still bothering me but I am trying to let it go.  I
will probably have a discussion with him.  I never had any intention of
reporting him.  I wouldn't want to mess up our relationship.

He has had this problem before where he says things that he thinks are ok, but
they are offensive.  He hasn't done this in over a year.  His sense of humor is
a bit different but we get along very well.

I just wanted to make sure he wasn't doing something that was actually against
the law.  I typically have great relationships with all my co-workers.
His intention wasn't in the interest of the child regarding this, he was just
being an ass that day.  We did have one discussion and he did say that he was
having a bad day, which means he probably said something he didn't mean to say
outloud!!

OK, heard from the National DAV HQ
They first said that the thrift stores had NOTHING to do with the national
organization but later, when I said that because of this I'd stop my donations
to the thrift stores, said that by doing so I'd hurt the national organization.
I refrained from pointing out their two doffering stories.
They said to have the state chapter deal with the issue but when I told them
that the state President, Treasurer, Adjunct's Office, the person who has the
video feeds (I forget his title) and HR all punted the issue to others before
saying that all they'll do is speak to my old manager and make sure that this
never happens to anyone else in the future (after telling me how lots of DAV
policies, rules and regulations were broken) they just said to go to the state
Employment Office or other state agencies and get them to deal with it.

If nothing else I have learned that some organizations just cannot be trusted
to abide by their own policies (this place makes you sign a document, as a
condition for employment, saying you got an Employee Handbook when in fact
you'll never get one. This is but one thing all agreed was a violation of DAV
policy).

O well, you cannot win them all but what makes this sting is that 1) the person
who screwed up still works there and 2) it all could have been solved by a
quick look at the video feed for the night in question.

Dr Doctor> I don't know how old the kid is, but if we are talking about a boy
who is a teenager, whether the people placing staff mean to or not, there could
be repercussions for consistently giving him "hot" female staff. Especially if
he is not being adequately educated about sexuality (something that is all too
common among people who have developmental disabilities). Completely aside from
that, depending on how large he is and what kinds of difficulties he has, it
could be setting up the staff for physical injuries. I once worked with a 10yo
whose meltdowns (due to sensory overload) were truly epic. I was kicked in the

I need somewhere to bounce job options around.  I am still continuing my direct
sales business, but for a wide variety of reasons, need to add a "real job" (or
two!) to my schedule.

I've got a two week (paid) trial for basically an admin assistant job, starting
later this week.  It's 5-10 hrs/wk, at $8/hr.  I'm really hoping it works out,
and am very excited about the opportunity.  I really like the gal I'd be
working for, and she has had success in the direct sales company with which I'm
affiliated.

Next, I've got an offer on the table for part time, my choice of hours, at a
mall retail store at which I have previously worked, for $8/hr.  Not so
excited, but it'd be work, I'd get paid, and I know I can do it.  Downside,
it's probably going to be fairly high stress with the holidays coming.  I
worked there last year during the holidays and know exactly how bad it can get.
 I do have the option of working either in the sales area or in the
"production" area, where I'd be visible and accessible to customers, but
they're likely to just leave me alone.  (If I add this one to the schedule, I'd
definitely pick production.)

And third, I've got the potential of an offer coming for 25 hrs/wk at
$10.75/hr, plus mileage reimbursement, taking care of product placement type
work at big box retailers.  This one would be better pay and lower stress than
the retail production one, but more physically demanding, and isn't a sure
thing yet.

First one, like I said, my two week trial is starting later this week.  We both
agreed we don't want to hurt each other or be stuck with each other if it feels
like not a good fit. I want this one to be a good fit.  But this one on its own
isn't quite enough, so I need to add one (or both?) of the other two.  The
second one needs an answer one way or the other by the end of this week.  The
third one, the district manager is trying to push a requisition through,
because even though there's a "hiring freeze," there's also an anti-overtime
mandate from higher levels, and the company's rep I'm friends with is typically
working 60+ hrs/wk.

What do I do here?

I can see Yorick point but if the mall job caused you so much stress before, it
isn't going to be any different now.  You know retail and especially with the
holidays coming up that is the last thing you need.  Remember there was a
reason you quit that job to begin with, even if your job duties are a little
different this time around.  Maybe, just maybe you could work a few hours a
week at the mall job?  Don't over do it.

Do you think you can lift the amount of weight that they are requiring at the
big box store?  I worked for one and you can talk to me personally about my
experience.  It can be physically demanding but I was younger back then but I
can tell you what I can and can't do now.

Hopefully things work out at the Admin Asst job and hopefully she can get you
more hours later on.  Just remember that you need to keep your stress level in
check no matter what the job.

Ok, so my wife got a new confidentiality agreement that they want her to sign.
It basically says that if her employment ceases for any reason, she agrees not
to 'personally provide the same services' for a competitor, and that the
restriction applies with[in] 60 miles of any practice facility.

Other than that one paragraph, she's cool with the document.  That one
paragraph, however, gives her extreme pause.  We live in zip code 22315
(Alexandria VA), and the 60 mile radius restriction means that even if the
Practice lets HER go, she'd have to go as far as Pittsburgh, Philly, or New
Jersey to the north, or Harrisonburg and points south to the west, or Newport
News to VA Beach/Chesapeake to the south and east.

That's not at all a reasonable restriction on someone who's a back room
administrative employee.  She wants to get exempted from that one paragraph and
has asked me to draw up some wording for an email she wants to send to her
boss...   I'll post the email in the next post.

The offending paragraph reads:
I agree that during my employment with the Practice and for a period of 12
months after my employment with the Practice ceases, for whatever reason, I
will not personally provide the same services I provided for the Practice for a
competitor of the Practice, whereby such activities have the effect of
competing directly with the medical services provided by the Practice during my
employment and thereby threaten the Practice's legitimate business interests
("Competitive Services").  This restriction shall only apply with[in] 60 miles
of any practice office or facility

Dear [Boss' Name]



     I would like to discuss a serious concern I have with the confidentiality
agreement you gave me to sign.   Before I elaborate, I would like to stress
that I am generally happy in my job and do NOT intend to terminate my
employment with this Practice. I understand the need to safeguard patient
information, and am in full support of those provisions of this document.  What
concerns me, however, is paragraph 3a, titled 'Non-Competition'.  I would like
to discuss being exempted from the provisions of this paragraph.



     The paragraph reads: "I agree that during my employment with the Practice
and for a period of 12 months after my employment with the Practice ceases, for
whatever reason, I will not personally provide the same services I provided for
the Practice for a competitor of the Practice, whereby such activities have the
effect of competing directly with the medical services provided by the Practice
during my employment and thereby threaten the Practice's legitimate business
interests ("Competitive Services").  This restriction shall only apply with[in]
60 miles of any practice office or facility.



     I have a serious problem with the phrase "for whatever reason".  This
seems to imply that even if the Practice terminates my employment, I'm still
prohibited from working as a medical records administrator. Virginia is an
at-will state, and just like I can terminate my employment for any reason or no
reason, the Practice is also entitled to terminate my employment for any reason
or no reason. I have a right to work, and if thfe Practice terminates my
employment, I don't believe the Practice has a right to prevent me from having
a job at all.


     I also have an issue with the phrase "personally provide the same
services".  I am the Medical Records Administrator for this practice, and those
skills are generic.  No patients choose their doctor based on back room
administrative staff.  There would be no competitive advantage lost by the
Practice by my getting a job with a competitor.  I feel that this is an unfair
and unnecessary restriction on my right to work.


     I also have a serious problem with the restriction "with[in] 60 miles of
any practice office or facility."  The attached map of the area plots all 23
National Spine and Pain Center offices, and indicates a 60 mile radius around
each point by filling a circle in red.  The more intense red colors are where
circles overlap.  As you can see by looking at the map, paragraph 3a, should
the Practice terminate my employment, would require me to look for a new job in
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New Jersey, the extreme southern end of the Delmarva
peninsula, western Virginia (Harrisonburg and points south only), or the
Tidewater area (Newport News - Virginia Beach - Chesapeake).  I feel this is an
overly broad and unnecessary restriction on my right to work.

Thoughts?  Ellen's thinking is basically if they let her go, this paragraph
prevents her from getting a job anywhere unless we move.  Thanks to the job I
just got, and how cool they are with my military duty, no way we're moving
anytime soon.....

We *did* consult with an attorney who said this paragraph is too restrictive
and basically unenforceable, but if the Practice chooses to pursue it, that
would mean we'd have to go to court over it...

I'd especially like thoughts from those of you who are employers, getting an

Smoke Eater: I don't think there's much to worry about. The non-compete, even
if it were to be enforced, is predicated on your wife competing directly with
her current firm. I'm guessing she could be working for a practice less than
five miles away and not compete directly. Even if it were pursued, courts are
not going to rule in favor of an agreement that prevents someone from

I wouldn't worry about it.  Say that she does lose her job.  How would they
find out that she got a new job?  All she has to do is keep quiet that she got
a new job.  Since her job is a behind the scenes I don't see how they would
ever find out she got a new job.
I agree with Salubrious that they would not want to prevent someone of
supporting their family.
I remember working in the nursing home and we would have temps come in. They
signed an agreement with the temp agency that they would not take employement
in the nursing homes they are in directly.  There were several that ended up
getting hired and there was nothing the temp agency could do about it even
though they signed that paper.

Unrelated, but on the non-compete thing, when I was first breaking into IT, I
actually had an employer give me a hard time when I left, citing the NCA.

The company I was leaving was a small (4 employee) shop whose core business was
providing POS and custom software for local pharmacies.
The company I was going to was a services group that was providing in-house IT
support for Goldman Sachs at their NY HQ.

I was up-front and honest when GS asked me if I was bound by an NCA, and said
that while I was, there should be no conflict because I couldn't imagine either
company competing with each other. I even provided them with a copy of the NCA,
and they asked me to get a waiver from my previous employer, even though there
was no competition other than both jobs were providing IT support.

He actually gave me a whole speech about "How do I know that Goldman Sachs
isn't going to try to move in on the pharmacy software business?"
He eventually signed it, but the argument was ludicrous.

Employers with drug testing when the requirements of the job do not demand it
are not treating their employees with respect.   I'd be open to the argument
about costs-per-employee; no business could survive if every employee ended up
needing treatment.   However, since the liklihood that one will be out of work

test coverage (Alcohol being excluded and the most likely, followed by

As an employer, if ANY of my employees have a drug abuse issue and it affects
my customers, you think that's just going to rest between that employee and
my customer? That customer is going to tell others about their experience, and
that's going to have a negative impact on not only me, but all of my other
employees too as the company loses business and makes less money. What if that
employee steals from me to support their habit? What if they steal from

You don't have to find it compelling, but you cannot deny that it does happen.
When it's your company's liability and reputation on the line, you take every
step that you find reasonable to maintain the highest standards possible.

You find it an invasion of privacy? That's fine, don't let any employer violate
your privacy. Again, they're not required to offer you employment of any kind,
you're not forced to work for any company or at any position. Honestly, it
would be great if employees were responsible enough to keep their private lives
and activities at home, and bring none of it intothe work place. To some degree
and in many ways, that can happen. Nobody is perfect, though, and their lack of
perfection and control can have a negative impact on their employers,
co-workers, customers, clients etc.

I'm somewhat baffled any time I hear somebody complain about how their rights
are trampled on by their employer, as if they have no say in the matter what
soever. Nothing is ever unmovable. If there's a workplace policy that offends
you, there is nothing preventing you from addressing that with the appropriate
personnel. If they are fixed and will not relax or rescind the rule, you don't
have to accept their continue employment. In truth, though, most people will
only bitch about it and do nothing else, not because they don't have a choice,
but because they don't like the consequences of the choices they wish they
could make.

can not remember when I had my job at Target if I had to take a pee test or

physical and a pee test.  I see nothing wrong with it.  What I see wrong is why
people make such a big deal about it.  The physical doesn't even ask anything
personal, or if it does I ignore it.  They just want to know what your physical
capabilities are before you start the job so they are not liable for anything
after if there was something wrong.

I personally feel that if people make a big deal about it then they must be
doing something they do not feel they want to disclose to the employer, such as
drug use.
Being a store clerk you are dealing with PEOPLE and the way you present
yourself daily and how you treat others can be effected by drugs.  They are
more likely to steal because they will want $$$ for their habit.  Yes I agree
that people that are falling on hard times *might* want to steal but more than
likely they will work harder at their job to make ends meet.

I'm not saying she doesn't have a right to complain, but for many people all

other member of the company who can address it, they never take a stand,
because they're not willing to risk what they have.

For me it sort of lends to the Benjamin Franklin quote, those who would trade
liberty for security deserve neither. People want all the benefits of liberty
and to be able to do this or do that, but often when that liberty is threatened
they won't defend it because it means moving out of their comfort zone. In this
case, the possibility of losing their job and not being able to easily find
another.

No decision is ever easy, and it's always personal. It's just a question of

Dr Doctor> And, again, it a power that the employee willing chooses to hand
over to the employer. And it often doesn't even happen in the beginning.
Frequently it comes along as the employee grows more successful within the
company, they earn larger incomes, better benefits, and with that they
establish a lifestyle, Often times, when these conflicts come up, it's not that
the employee can't quit because they have no choice, but because they're not
willing to give up the things that they have established for themselves that
came as a benefit of having the job.

It means they might have to go without a paycheck for awhile, or that the next
job has a smaller salary, fewer benefits. It means that they can't keep paying
the mortgage on their house, or that they might have to rent a smaller or less
desirable domicile. It might mean they cannot afford to fund their children's
extra-curricular activity, or their college fund. It means they have to stop
leasing a nice vehicle, or go without one for awhile. You drop cable/satellite
TV for over-the-air. You're living on rice & beans instead of McDonalds for six
nights out of the week.

Smoke Eater> My attitude may be callous, but it is on both sides of the fence
here. Nobody is trapped into doing a job they don't want to perform anymore
because of workplace bullshit. And even if you are fired for that bullshit,
it's not like that's the end of the road. Teachers fired for stupid shit on FB
can, and do, fight back for their jobs. Often times it ends up being that the
school district pays a settlement to keep them out of the news, but that's the
price the employer is willing to pay also.

People are only trapped if they're willing to let themselves be trapped. Life's
not fair, it's not easy, thing's aren't right. That may be so, but what we are
guaranteed in this country is the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. No employer can ever take that away from you without your
cooperation. And if you ever want it back, then in most cases (barring any
employement contract that says otherwise) all you have to do is step out the
door and never return.

Let's be honest, though. It's not a 1:1 power relationship to begin with
because what you're bringing to the company, in most cases, is much less than
the company is bringing you. In most cases, you're just some dude who has a set
of skills. The company is giving you money, benefits, title and all the power
and trappings that come with your position. You often have an opportunity to
increse all of that with your continued employment and growing ability to
contribute to the company. The company is putting its name, reputation and
resources on the line to partner with you.

That doesn't mean that they have all the power in their relationship, because
you have no duty to continue accepting any of those things. If you're tired of
it, you can leave. In most cases, you don't even have to formally announce your
resignation.  Will it matter to the company? Perhaps not, but once you're ready
to take that step, what does it matter what it means to the company?

KAM, you're a little all over the map here. So, the employee has ultimate power
over the employer by virtue of their ability to leave, but we still need the
government to stop employers from behaving unethically towards their employees?

I mean, I understand the ultra-Libertarian "you can always leave and find
another job" argument. I don't agree with it, but at least it's consistent.

Most people understand that (especially nowadays) the employer holds VASTLY
more power in the employment relationship than the employee. With that in mind,
it's not a bad thing for employers to be legally held to more ethical treatment
of their employees with the understanding that the market won't really correct
this wrong very efficiently.

Whether or not drug testing or surfing Facebook is a
"wrong" is up for debate, but I'm not sure I consider invading an employee's
privacy wholesale with no legitimate business purpose (talking Facebook
password demands here) a very ethical thing to do.

It doesn't matter that the company has one person, one hundred persons, or 100
million persons. None of that matters one iota when it comes to YOUR
relationship with the employer. Does the employer have the upper hand? Yeah,
because as I said, they're the ones putting everything on the line just to have
you in their fold. Unless you're Michael Jordan re-signing with the Chicago
Bulls, your contribution to the team is going to be vastly smaller than the
contribution of all the other employees.

Still, unless you're contractually bound, that relationship ends as soon as you
decide you're done. That doesn't mean it HAS to end. You're not bound by
anything from stepping up and making a complaint to those who can address it.
Business is a give-and-take relationship, and if a company realizes that it's
at risk to losing a good chunk of it's employees because of a bad rule, they'll
either change, or they'll gamble that those people will leave and the company
will have to replace them, re-train those replacements, etc. The company also
has to face public scrutiny, and maybe government scrutiny as well.

Are you claiming the employers only have an ethical responsibility to "do the
right things" once the government has passed a law requiring it?  Or do they
have some responsibility _before_ that moment?   If so, why do you suggest
that it's appropriate to have anything other than the full range of responses
to unethical behavior?  Some will quit (or not apply), others will complain
or protest in some formal fashion, others will complain silently, others
will simply be indifferent rather than supportive.

All reactions are not only legitimate, they're a necessary part of the picture
in order to push a policy change.

Policy changes--company or government--usually come about as a spectrum
of opinions.   The gay marriage law that just passed in Maryland was voted
"yes" by bisexual psychology grad students and by Lutherans who just had
their first real conversation about homosexuality last month.   If you're
going to be successful, you'll need all kinds.

You say, "Well, only if you let me have really degrading sex with you. I mean,

Most people would say that this is a seriously awful, immoral, and unethical

That, to a lesser degree, is the same question as invasions of privacy in the
employment arena. Because employees are _so_ dependent upon employers, the
employers can make put the employees in these coercive-choice situations.

The naive libertarian response is to say, "Well, then businesses will open that
won't require these awful things, they will become more powerful and crowd out
the market, and all will be well." Of course, this pattern really isn't seen
too often in the real world. Just the opposite, in fact.

The REALLY interesting question is to say, "Is it more immoral to ask for

null. If a client asks her to take a drug test, she's free to tell them to go

I am not failing to recognize the validity of the restraints on people. What I
am recognizing is that people put these restraints on themselves. They were
free to make the choices that restrain them, they're free to make the choices
that unrestrain them. It is because some choices may be undesirable that many
people choose to stay where they are. Change may not be easy, but change is not
impossible. Again, it entirely depends on what you value the most. Whatever
that is, stand by it.

I'm not trying to say that whatever an employer does is okay, because it's not.
What I am staying is that nobody has to be a victim of an employer's antics if
they wish not to be. They're not without options, they're not without power.
But, again, many people choose not to exercise that power because they don't
like the consequences.

To take your own analogy, while your current circumstances may not push you to
quit your job and take up ditch digging, I'm sure that there could be SOMETHING
that pushes you to at least consider that point. It's at that moment you have
to decide what you value more. Perhaps that is extreme, but I don't find it
unreasonable. Whatever it is you value, you should defend it. That's not only
your right, it is your duty to yourself as a free human being.

Yorkick> Of course employers have a duty to be ethical before any law forces
them to, but unless there is a law, then you're deaing with a different beast,
and no employer is beholden to follow any particular ethics, and they're free
to establish whatever they believe is ethical. That's a two-way street, though,
employees can also do the same. Bitching about the consequences may be valid
(after all, who can stop you), but simply complaining to yourself or to others
who have no influence or power will never change things, and most likely will
just end up alienating those who would like to be sympathetic and supportive.
Nobody likes a whiner.

Steppenwolf> Why is an employee "_so_ dependent upon employers"? If that is
your mentality, then you're setting yourself up to be a slave, and that is a
valid choice that you can willingly choose. And, if you do so, don't be
surprised when your employer exercises power similar to that of a slave master.
As for myself, when I apply for a job, it is because they're offering a
position where they need somebody with a particular skill and experience, and I
am approaching them as a person who can fill that role, and we're going to make
a deal on how we can both mutually benefit each other to accomplish our goals.

Can we at least agree that while both sides always have the option to walk

The employee is now without a job, until he finds another, which is harder than
is usually the case in the current economy... and has immediate concerns about
how to cover bills, his insurance coverage, etc...

The employer just has to replace a fairly interchangable cog in the machine of
his business, and usually just have everyone else work a bit harder until he
does-  If he even does.

abuse me in every way possible were it not specifically prohibited by law, and
I don't think most employers are like that. One consequence of all the existing
regulations is that it has become expensive and difficult to hire and fire
workers, so companies are more cautious about hiring full-time employees. This
makes it more difficult for people to leave a current job and quickly find a
new job, so they may feel they have to put up with whatever bad conditions

I never once said that you don't have to worry about homlesness or starvation

things which you value. Even in 2012, we don't get to have "ALL TEH THINGS!!"
in our life that we might want. Frequently we must make choices where something
that we might want for ourselves is sacrificed or diminished in favor of
something else that we value even more.


I'll share with you a few of my own experiences:

In 2005 I went to work for a Fortune 100 company, our division processed
poorly-scanned medical documents submitted to insurance companies and attempted
to decypher them so the company could finish processing them. A real "Office
Space" type environment. Several months into the job our immediate management
team pissed me off with their Internet access policy. We were in a slow period
for the last month or so where sometimes we'd be waiting 2-3 hours for work to
come down the pipe. We literally sat around and did NOTHING, we're buried 2
levels underground. At one time, we could go on the Internet and check e-mail
and stuff but somebody in mangement decided that because we dealt with
potentially sensitive medical information that this info could be leaked out by
one of us, so they disabled that. (Never mind that I could walk over to any of
the boxes that had redundant print-outs of those same documents, drop them in
an envelope and then ship it out right under their own nose in the many piles
of outgoing mail which were under no guard, key or security camera.)

That was fine, until March Madness came around and our immediate management,
which DID have Internet access, spent most of the month in their offices kicked
back and watching NCAA tournament games online, playing on AOL an Yahoo games,
and generally living it up.  I decided that was enough of this company's
shennanigans. I had found out a few months earlier that while our division's
offices didn't have unfettered Internet access, tht the conference room 150
feet down the hall from us was free and clear. After poking around, I found
that there was nothing blocking us from reaching any computer in the building.
I brought in a spare laptop on its last legs, plugged in a pair of ethernet
cards to a port in the conference room, stashed it away in a corner, and VOLIA,
we have our own secret Internet.

I didn't do this out of ignorance. I realized that if I got caught, at the very
least, I was going to lose my job. At the worst maybe  I did get prosecuted for
a potential violation of HIPPA or something. I felt that the risk was low
enough that I could get away with it. And I did for almost 5 months. My mistake
was that I didn't do this for me, I did it so that all my co-workers, whom I
liked and trusted, could also share and that we would not be bored and going
crazy trapped in a dank hole for 8 hours a day. Unfortunately my trust was
misplaced, one of them told a manager about it. One day my security badge
stopped working, security dragged me into their office, head of building
security plus my manager grilled me for 90 minutes about what I had been doing,
sent me home and then terminated me over the phone the next day.

Yes, probably one of the stupidest things I every did. Immediately unemployed,
living paycheck to paycheck essentially, wife and three kids. I did wrong by
them, I did wrong by the company. I didn't do it out of ignorance, though. It
was a willful choice that I made, knowing what the consequences could be, and I
evaluated what was important to me against all my available options and found
what I thought to be the best compromise.


After two months of beating down jobs and living off the wife's paycheck, I
finally landed at job at our local Wendy's. Pretty decent job, no benefits, but
I was making 75 cents/hr more than at my previous job. After working there for
nearly a year, I liked it, not my dream job, but it was stable work and I got
right at 40 hours a week, I could work any position in the store and with the
exception of not being available to work on Sundays and select Saturdays due to
a side job that I had picked up, the store could depend on me to come in at
anytime they needed me. A new assistant manager was brought in from another
store, and eventually was promoted to store manager when ours decided to take a
religious sabbatical. Professionally we got along, but she was a hard ass.

One afternoon driving to work, the main bypass which lead to our store was
backed up for a few blocks. Finally traffic creeped up to where the blockage
was at. An elderly woman's vehicle had broken down in the middle of the road as
she was trying to make a lane change. Instead of somebody taking a moment to
help her, everybody was more focused on getting home in evening traffic and
thus drove around her, angrily honking horns, scaring the shit out of her. I
decided to stop, parked my car so I was blocking ALL the traffic, but which
then cleared up the lanes so that I could get her car pushed to the side of the
road without some idiot trying to run us over. After, I was able to call her
son and let him know what's going on, he arranged for a tow truck to come out
and came to pick her up.

All of this made me 10 minutes late for work. After explaining my tardiness, my
new boss decided to write me up for being late. I could have accepted that,
except that in doing so she remarked that I should have been thinking of the
company first, and thinking about how I inconvenienced ALL my other co-workers
who wanted to go home at 5pm. Never mind that we wern't even busy enough to
require ALL the day shift to stay over, nothing that one person on night shift
coudn't have covered two positions for a few minutes, or even ASK just one
person to stay if need be. Granted, she may have been technially right in that
I did inconvenience my co-workers, but I thought that was a pretty fucking
selfish thing to say in light of what happened. I'm sure she probably would
have been outraged if that woman out on the bypass was her own grandmother and
nobody else had stopped to help her.

At that point I felt I had a true moral dilemma, did I value working at a job
that gave me decent hours and pay, but while working for a heartless bitch of a
boss who puts the company over people? After a few minutes of stewing, I
decided that my career at Wendy's was done. I didn't quit on the spot, but it
sent me looking for new work and planning my exit strategy. Two weeks later I
had a new job lined out, and two weeks after that was my last day. On my
birthday. I threw myself a pizza party at work, and was probably one of the
best days of work I've ever had anywhere. Everybody thought I was crazy, but
none of them turned down clearing out $50 worth of pizza. :-)

What KAM is failing to realize is that the choice between "shitty job" and

To equalize it, the choice for businesses would need to be "employ KAM" or "go
out of business, or at least be unprofitable for a significant amount of time".

Choosing between a shitty job and no job at all (which is more than likely,
even for highly-paid people nowadays) is not really a "choice" for the majority
of people. Most people aren't capable of supporting a family and paying a

  I think the distinction is what is a plausable choice.
  You can just kill yourself and be done with it.
  I don't think anyone would argue that is a choice though.

  A friend had a job teaching kids with disabilities. A new kid started
  at their school. The kid broke some fingers of the other teachers. My friend
  decided it was time to leave that job, as opposed to being the next person
  with a broken something.
  She asked her employer if there was something they could do about this kid
  but there didn't appear to be anything they could do (I'm not 100%
  familiar with all the details).

  Her choice was pretty easy because her husband has a good job, they have
  no kids and she got another job pretty quick. Later she got a different
  teaching job so she is happy (instead of the job she got in the middle
  doing something she didn't much care for).

  When the choice is:
  Accept whatever BS you're getting so you can continue to _live_, the
  amount of BS will go pretty high before you decide to quit, loose your
  house/apartment/food/etc.

  How did this all start again?

It started because life happens. Said kid could have bumped into her at the
grocery store and broken her fingers. She could have slammed them in a drawer
at home, too.

If employers could promise that your entire work career would be perfect, easy,
and without strife, nobody would ever need to leave a job. The sad reality is
that no employer can promise this, nor is it their business or responsibility
to ensure that you're perfectly satisfied with your job.

Thankfully, the employee can correct this in many ways. Yes, some more
plausable than others, but it's foolish to say that there's never an option.

Looking for some help in tactfully replying to a company.

I work regularly as a mystery shopper/hidden auditor. For this one particular
company, I go to a restaurant and order a meal, I make notes on the food and
beverage prices, I evaluate customer service and how the food is served.
The industry standard for compensation for this is a reimbursement for a meal
(typically set at a maximum amount) plus a cash payment for an hour or two of
work, including time to write up and submit the report.

Yesterday I received an offer for a large bar & restaurant chain. The
compensation on this is either $25 or lunch or $40 for dinner, only it is
offered on the chain's gift card. The amount offered on the gift card would
be around what you would spend on a meal at this restaurant. In the e-mail, the
company actually stated, "If you're not interested in the gift card you could
give it away or sell it on eBay."

I'm completely aghast. I've never felt so disrespected for what I've done for a
living for the last 15 years. Out of frustration, more than anything, I replied
back to the individual responsible for this client, "How would you feel if your
entire paycheck was replaced with Company X's gift card? That's what you just
offered me."  Their reply back was, "I can understand your viewpoint as a
professional auditor. You need to understand their standpoint as a professional
company. Some people would greatly appreciate the opportunity to receive money
towards food. You are not required to take a shop at one of these locations.
Unfotunately this is the way the client has set up to reimburse the shoppers
that conduct their shops."

At this point, I'm not going to accept any more assignments from this company.
Still, I'd like for this person to understand that not only is this type of
offer for compensation unacceptable, it devalues the individuals that the
company relies on to complete this work for the client, and that it would be
better if they declined such clients rather than try to pass this off as
an acceptable compensation for a professional's time and training.

I think I've found how I want to reply:

  Based on your last reply, I don't think you do understand my viewpoint as
  a professional auditor.

  First, ABC Restaurant and Company X is asking me to take my own money to
  pay for this event, and my reimbursement is not the industry standard of
  paying me back in cash, but store credit, which means that I don't get my
  cash back to spend elsewhere, I have to spend it with this company again.
  It doesn't matter if I personally don't wish to spend my money with them,
  I have no choice, I'm now locked into their system. Second, when you
  consider the price of their food, plus taxes and a fair tip expected by
  the wait staff, that takes up nearly the entire amount of the
  reimbursement, which means my actual work is less than federal minimum
  wage. Third, even though ABC Restaurant gets to treat their $40 store
  credit as a promotional write-off for tax purposes, I have to treat it the
  whole of it as income. The IRS, Kentucky state auditor and my local city
  and county tax boards won't let me write that off likewise. Store credit
  doesn't pay my taxes, it doesn't pay for my kids' college fund, my health
  care insurance, or my mortgage. On top of not actually receiving cash
  payment for my services, both ABC Restaurant and Company X is requiring me
  to pay the tax on this income from another source. If I were being paid in
  cash, the money to pay the taxes would be included.

  If it seems like I'm not greatly appreciative, as you have put it, for
  this opportunity, you are right. The only opportunity here is that ABC
  Restaurant is attempting to take an unfair advantage of auditors who do
  have to work for a living, and Company X appears to be complicit with this
  act. Or, is everybody at Company X likewise being paid with ABC Restaurant
  store credit? Would that pay your company's utilities, or accountants, the
  phone company? Put yourself in my shoes for just a moment. Can you put gas
  in your vehicle, or pay your Internet provider with ABC Restaurant store
  credit? I'm certain that if you, in your capacity, were presented with
  this as your only option of compensation, you wouldn't spend more than a
  second or two before you started looking for your next job.

  While it may not be that much per individual, if you did not have your
  auditors, then you would have no business to operate at all. I'm more than
  disappointed that Company X would even entertain such an offer from a
  client which completely devalues and disrespects your company's
  independent contractors and their time, training and dedication to
  maintaining the high standards that your company expects.

Although your post prompted me to go look at their web site again. I don't see
where they claim any affiliation with any of the industry trade groups, which
is suspicious because for the last several years I've only signed up with
companies via MSPA. They implemented a simple system where I can automatically
submit my billing and receive offers across many companies.

So, on a lark, I tried to log into their web site. Turns out I don't have a
valid username or password. So now I REALLY wanna know why I'm receiving these
e-mails. I got this e-mail via my Yahoo account, which I used to use for all my
shops but over the last few years I've moved my most frequently used ones to my

Maybe I should just drop it and let it go, since I've apparently never actually
worked for them, but considering everything else I feel that maybe they should
be told that they're being really cheap and it looks bad.

The article does refer readers to the Mystery Shoppers Providers Association
for more information. MSPA is the de-facto trade organization that most
legitimate mystery shopping companies align themselves with, and has developed
their own certification programs and training seminars as part of establishing
industry standards.

Shops that typically ask for MSPA certification would be ones where you are in
posession of company property (recording equipment, computers, etc.), or high-
end shops where you may be required to test the client's property such as
automobile and motorcycle dealerships. Many resorts and casino clients will
also request only shoppers who hold certifications. Certification is also
typically required if you want to move from being a shopper to a scheduler
or higher up in management in a company.

Gwynn> The "backslash text frac a b" on the Wikipedia page is the fraction "a
over b". Your screen reader is just reading out the markup.
        As for the content of your question, division is defind as the reverse
of multiplication. That is, when you evaluate A/B, you're really asking to find
a number C such that A=B*C. Writing it as A/B is just a notational shorthand
that avoids the separate equation. Now if B is zero, you're asking for a number
C that, when multiplied by zero, gives you A.
        If A is non-zero, no value would fit for C, because anything times zero
would still be zero, but you ask for such C that the result of the
multiplication would be non-zero.
        If A is zero, any vaulue would fit for C, because, again, anyting times
zero is zero, so A=B*C holds for any C. This is why 0/0 is called "undefined"
(as opposed to "does not exist" for all other A/0).
        A common idea is to define A/0=infinity to bypass this, but that would
give you inconsistencies when you would try to compute on with these
infinities. For example, when doing arithmetic with fractions, you can either
evaluate each fraction and work on with the results (3/4-1/4=0.75-0.25=0.5) or
you can collect like fractions and evaluate the result (3/4-1/4=2/4=0.5) and
you'll get the same result either way. If you would try to do the same with the
infinities as just defined, you would get two different results
(3/0-1/0=infinity-infinity=0 versus 3/0-1/0=2/0=infinity).
        You could try to work around that by defining only 1/0=infinity and
building the rest from there, 2/0=2*infinity, etc, but this would just push the
inconsistencies a few steps further. For example,  try to work out what the
value of infinity*0 must be in that case. I'm sure an inconsistency can be
shown for every way you define it.

If 1 is prime, then you can throw in a 1^1 or 1^2 or 1^3 or 1^4 and it's no

Division doesn't "transform" numbers.  It's an operation that takes two
inputs and gives one output.  And it's only defined on certain inputs.

Factorial is another operation.  It, also, is only defined on certain

The generalization of factorial is the gamma function, which is defined for
negative non-integers, indeed, "for all complex numbers except the non-positive
integers":
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function

Division-by-zero is one of those things I avoid computationally and mostly wave
off ("shoo, go away!") analytically, but for which I have a vague appreciation.

As was mentioned by someone in this thread recently, division is defined
as, for example:

    A / eps,  where A > 0 is positive, eps > 0 is positive and "small".

With A constant, the quantity ( A / eps ) gets larger as eps gets smaller.
Numerical example:
  A = 10
  eps = 2.0000     (A/eps) =      5.0000
  eps = 1.0000     (A/eps) =     10.0000
  eps = 0.1000     (A/eps) =    100.0000
  eps = 0.0100     (A/eps) =   1000.0000
  eps = 0.0010     (A/eps) =  10000.0000
  eps = 0.0001     (A/eps) = 100000.0000
  eps --> zero     (A/eps) --> +infinity

This represents a "pole" (reaching upward infinitely high) when eps = 0.
For a mathematician, this is still well-defined.  If A were negative, then
(A/eps) would tend towards -infinity.  While this is hard to deal with for
digital computer systems, some allow representation, to the system's limits for
precision, using IEEE-754 (I think that's the spec) and allow the
floating-point unit to return bit patterns for +infinity, -infinity, NaN
(not-a-number).  Many application programs do not fully use these computational
features, however, because they are fairly specialized.  Programs like MATLAB
and other numerical-specialty programs do "understand" this, however.

"Poles and zeros":  Further, consider equation (x-1)/(x+1)=0.
  As discussed above, this has a POLE at x = -1  (zero in denominator).
        This equation also has a ZERO at x = +1  (zero in numerator).

Much beyond this starts getting well into "complex analysis" (technical area of
mathematics), which I can sort of follow with hand-holding, but am not expert.
(It is background material for control systems theory, which is where I have
encountered it, mostly.  Think "Laplace Transforms", "Fourier Transforms", etc.
)

However, if it is true that a prime number is defined as a whole number with
exactly two whole number divisors, then 1 is not a prime number.

And if it is true that a prime number is defined as an animal with one horn and

That's a decent chunk of what CERN and Fermilab do.  They make energetic beams
and collide them such that they can create mass that wasn't there before.  The
Higgs Boson for example is expected to have a mass of about 115 protons, they
take two protons and give them lots of energy so that they can collide two
protons mass and make an object with >100 protons masses.

No, mass-energy equivalence comes naturally out of the theory of relativity.
Once you make the corrections necessary to explain the fact that the speed of
light is the same in every direction no matter your motion, then the c^2 factor
pops right out of the equation.

Some fun statistics.

I'm designing an RPG where the chances of successfully using a skill are equal
to the number of "hit dice" that come up with a "hit" compared to the number of
"challenge dice" that come up with a "fail."

A "hit" dice is a 6-sided dice with three sides indicating hit, and three sides
indicating no hit.

A "challenge" dice is a 6-sided dice with two sides indicating a "fail" and
four sides indicating no fail.

For example, if the player is attempting to climb a sheer cliff, and the player
has a "climb" skill of 9, and the cliff has a challenge rating of 15, then the
game rolls 9 hit dice, and 15 challenge dice.  If more hit dice roll "hit" than
challenge dice roll "fail," the climb is successful, with a tie also being a
success.

Obviously, if it's an "even match" (10 hit dice vs. 10 fail dice), the odds
favor success.  This is by design, because success is more fun than failure.

Anyway, so some statistics.  I ran some simulations and assume equal skill vs.
challenge, you succeed more and more often the higher the skill.  With 3 vs 3,
it bottoms out at 80%, but it climbs steadily, but somewhat logorithmically
from there.  By skill 50, you are succeeding 95% of the time.

I like that design choice because it encourages people to keep improving -
sure, the challenges get harder, but you actually overcome them even more
often.

So here's the fun statistics.  There's soething called a "lucky" streak.  When
you're on a "lucky streak," every time you roll a hit dice that comes up "fail,
you get a reroll.  Same with challenge dice.

Obviously, for hits, that gives you a 75% chance of hitting.  You will either
roll a hit, or roll a miss and then a hit or miss:

     hit (hit)
     hit (miss)
     miss (hit)
     miss (miss)

Only in the 4th category, where both rolls miss, do you actually miss.

It's a little harder to compute for the challenge dice, but it can be done.

The question is this -- if you're on a lucky streak and so is the other player,
does the situation favor offense or defense?  That is, will your offensive
skills ("hit" rolls) gain more, or will the lucky player's challenge rolls
(defense skills) gain more.

Or, is the benefit approximately the same?

multiple-choice question?  How many perfect scores would there be?"  He then
goes on to show that the answer is pretty damn close to never.  Which is where
I'm going with this -- people seem to have a hard time really getting the
essence of truly large numbers, e.g. IPv6 -- that's 2^128 IP addresses.  And
yet people keep talking about it as if it's just "more," and that there's
somehow a concern we might yet run out of addresses.  "But what if every single
thing in your house gets an IP address?  Every single electronic component in
every car?  How about *THEN*?"  I try pointing out that if they assigned an IP

A probable issue would be on the "network" prefix though. Currently, /32s are

But then, there are 2^32 /32 prefixes, which amounts to *the entire IPv4

Here is the mistake, at this point person 9 and 1 are adjacent.  Since we
didn't get rid of the "last" person in the circle, we must get rid of the
person next to them (person 1).  So the next time around the circle would
eliminate 1, skip 5, then eliminate 9, leaving person 5 as the last of the 10

I'll google it ;)

Ah wait, after looking again, I do think that one of those people is redundant.
Try this:

(1)  5 ... 4 - Stop here, distribute 3 days of water to others

(2)  5 ...+5 ... 4 - Head back, give up 2 days

(3)  5 ...+5 ...+5 ... 4 - Head back, give up 1 day

(4)  5 ...+5 ...+5 ...+5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... END

That seems much more natural. I would love to know how to solve this with an
equation or some other proveable method. Surely y'all are better at math than
me ;)

This came up in the Children Of Chaos books by Dave Duncan.  A barren
mountain pass separated two lands (the world is a dodecahedron and the
mountain range is an edge of the die) and you can only carry so many
supplies, so the people managing the pass learn how to "ladder" their
troops.

The number grows very very fast as compared to the length of the trip.
Consider the simple example:

 To get 1 day worth of water to the day-2 marker, you need 1 person.
 (They use 2 getting out there, leave 1, and use 2 getting back.)

Call that "X".

To get 1 day worth of water to the day-4 marker, you need 5 people:
the first 4 people each do "X", leaving four days of water at day-2.
Then the fifth person walks two days to day-2.  He takes two of the
four, does "X" to leave 1 unit of water of day-4, and uses the two
remaining supply to get back safely.

If you call that "Y", you can then imagine what you would need to
get 1 day worth of water to day 6: 5 "Y"s, or 30 people.

(I believe the problem is equivalent if you have people leaving secure
supplies or moving in synchronized groups.  In theory 1 person could
cross the desert by himself if he had enough time to prepare supply
caches.)

Now the question becomes how to best prepare those caches for 1 guy
to make a 1-way trip.  You can leave 2 water at day-2 and 1 water at
day-4, which takes , 2*"X" + 1*"Y" + 1 = 2 + 5 + 1 = 8 people.

JL, if I understand your second solution, it's like this:

Day-0: 4 people with 20 water.

Day-1: 4 people with 16 water.  Send 1 back (losing 1 water), to get
       3 people with 15 water.

Day-2: 3 people with 12 water.  Send 1 back (losing 2 water), to get
       2 people with 10 water.

Day-3: 2 people with 8 water.  Send 1 back (losing 3 water) to get
       1 person with 5 water.

Then that person can just do the straight run.

You win over me because you have that last person picking up 1 extra
water on each of day-1, day-2, and day-3, where I had them geting 2
on day-2 and 1 on day-4.  Last time I worked this problem out I think
it was each person could have 3 days of supplies, so I solved for
day-2, day-4, and day-6, but not day-1 or day-3.  Getting water to
day-1 takes a fractional person unit so I avoided it, but that's
probably my mistake.

So I'm running into problems of just how fine-grained I can divide
people up.  If it were possible to break this up indefinitely, so
someone could turn around 1/6 of the way through a day, we'd probably
get an answer that involves e=2.71828.

I'm assuming each person can only return or continue at integral
day markers to keep myself sane(r) for now.

I think the trick is to have people as fully-loaded as possible
until they make the return trip, and also to leave the situation
as best off as possible.  The trick is when figuring out when you
are close enough to the victory condition that you start extracting
all the wealth you've left on the path.

I can slightly beat JL's solution if I'm looking for a steady state
solution, where we are regularly sending people through.

The goal is to get one man (the lead man) through the 3rd day.  He'll have 2
days of water on him, and he needs 5 to complete the trek. Someone must be
there to hand him 3 days of water.

So send a second man. The goal is also to get this man through the 3rd day.
He'll have 2 days of water on him, needs 3 to return, plus 3 to hand to the
first man. So someone must be there to hand him 4 days of water.

So send a third man. The goal is also to get this man through the 3rd day.
He'll have 2 days of water on him, needs 3 to return, plus 4 to hand to the

Here's how to do it:
Circumference of the Earth: c = 2pi*r
Circumference of string: C = 2pi*R
If we let x be the additional bit we added to the string, then C = c + x

So,    2pi*R = 2pi*r + x

Divide through by 2pi

R = r + x/2pi

So if the string could hover above the ground, it would hover x/2pi high.

If x = 1m then we are talking about 16 cm.

Note that it doesn't matter how big c is.  Just x.

Water-problem> Got it! Damn. The difficult part is that it asks for a *minimal*
solution, not just any solution. At first I approached it by trying to miminize
a cost function, but the constraints tripped me up.  Instead, below I approach
it by working backwards from the goal, at each step showing that it is globally
minimizing.

    n       :  total # of participants. The goal is to minimize n.
    L <= n  :  # of Leaders, men who cross.
    k=L-n   :  # of porters, men who turn around.

1. Show that there is only one leader (L = 1).

   L must be at least 1, or the expedition fails.

   If L is greater than 1, then each of the leaders requires additional
   porters to assist. Since the additional leaders do not assist the first
   leader, they could simply stay home.

2. Show that the leader travels alone from day 3.

   The farthest the last porter(s) can be and still turn around is day 5.  The
   leader must complete his trek alone after that time.  However, the leader
   can complete the trek alone from day 3, too. Or 4, or any point between
   days 3 and 5. Let this point be d. The amount of water required from that
   point is,

        w(d) = (8-d) + 2Kd
             = (2K-1)d + 8
        where 3<= d<= 5, and K is the # of porters at that point.

   Since w(d) is a linear function in d with positive slope (2K-1), then its
   global minimum is at the minimum abscissa, which is 3.

   Therefore, there is one leader who travels alone from day 3.

3. Introduce flow model and generalizations:

   (a) There are k porters who turn around at times t1,t2,t3,...tk.
       Where t_i >= t_(i+1). That is, t1 is the "last" porter to turn around,
       and tk is the first. (The reverse of actual time.)

   (b) When a porter turns around, he keeps enough water for himself to return,
       and gives the remainder to the others. It does not matter who he gives
       the water to. HOWEVER...

   (c) We can model the instantaneous transfer of water at time t_i as a
       continuous flow at a given rate from the porter to the others between
       the time t_(i+1) and t(i). (By the fundamental theorem of calculus.)

   (d) A porter must maximize his net outward flow to the group in order
       to minimize the solution.

       * A constraint is that his maximum flow rate cannot surpass the total
         rate at which capacity becomes available in the other's flasks.

   (e) Because (b) says it doesn't matter who we assign the water to, we can
       model the net flow from k porters to the leader as the flow from
       each individual porter to the next, with one porter designated as
       flowing to the leader.


4. Show the leader's net flow equation.

   The leader starts with 5 units of water, and loses 1 unit of water per unit
   time, over 3 days,  and completes day 3 with a total of 5 units of water,
   plus a net flow of r*t1 from the porters who traveled alongside him
   for t1 days contributing a flow of r1 (unit water per unit time).

        5 - 1*3 + r1*t1 = 5

   r1*t1 = 3. Where t1 <= 3.  But say t < 3, then that would mean the last
   porters turned around at t1 < 3. The leader could make it only as far as
   t1+5 < 8.  So t1 must be 3, and r1 is 1. Observe that r1 <= 1, the leader's
   rate of capacity, satisfying the constraint in (d).

   Therefore: At least one porter travels for 3 days alongside the leader,
   contributing at a rate of 1.

5. Show the first porter's net flow.

   The first porter starts with 5 units, loses at a rate of 1 for himself,
   1 to the leader, both over 3 days. He receives incoming flow r2 from the
   other porters, the last of whom turns around at time t2. Porter 1 must
   arrive at time 3 with at least 3 units of water for himself to make the
   return trip.

           5 -1*3 -r1*t1 + r2*t2 >= 3
           5 -1*3 -1*3   + r2*t2 >= 3
      or,  r2*t2 >= 4
      where t2 <= t1.

   Observe that r2*t2 cannot be zero, i.e., another porter is required.

   By (d), maximize r2. Porter 1's capacity rate is 2, so r2 <= 2. Plug it in:

            2*t2 >= 4
              t2 >= 2  -- ok.

   Therefore, porter 1 receives net flow from the other porters at a rate of 2
   for 2 days, at which point they turn around.

6. Continue in a similar fashion with the 2nd porter. He travels for 2 days,
   loses 1/d for himself, loses r2*t2 to the 1st porter, and gains r3*t3 from
   the third porter. He must have at least 2 units remaining to return home.

           5 - 1*2 - r2*t2 + r3*t3 >= 2
      or   r3*t3 >= 3
      where t3 <= t2.

   Observe that r3*t3 cannot be zero, i.e., another porter is required.
   By (d), maximize r3. Porter 2's capacity rate is 3, so let r3=3,

        3*t3 >=3
          t3 >=1  -- ok.

   Therefore, porter 2 receives from porter 3 at a rate of r3=3 for t3=1 days.

7. Continue with porter 3:

        5 - 1*1 - r3*t3 + r4*t4 >= 1

   Observe that r4*t4 may be zero. That means either t4=0, meaning
   the additional porters don't travel at all, or r4=0, meaning the
   additional porters provide no water.

   Therefore, no additional porters are necessary.
   Since we are minimizing n, we do not send additional porters.

Thus, a minimal solution is 1 leader and 3 porters, who turn around at times
1, 2, and 3.

Depending on what you mean by "last" porter, there can still be
someone who gets out beyond day 5 and still returns home.  They can
get farther than that if someone else meets/leaves water for them
partway through.  If the desert were more than 10 days long, in fact,
you would need porters going way out past the point where they could
rely on themselves to return safely.

Order the porters according when they turn around. This is always possible.
There are K ports who are the "last" to turn around in my equation.

I assumed this wasn't possible in the original problem description. Otherwise,
the expedition would require only 1 man, who leaves caches of water for
himself to pick up at a later time.

Force is not an appropriate quantity in this context. The ball can certainly
apply a force to the boy, but you would need to know more, such as how long the
ball was in contact with the boy before it stopped moving. And psi is a unit of

know the size of the ball.

Mass remains unchanged, so that the force varies as the acceleration. Maybe the

going to have a negative acceleration.  Anyway, I seem to recall being taught
some formula (like 20 years ago) dealing with force that had to do with a
constant velocity.  Anyway, back to the original problem, what would be a good
way to measure the force of a ball hiting someone one?  If you say the ball hit

There is a LOT of fascinating stuff going on with entropy and time. It all gets
mixed up with black holes, too, which seem to almost completely screw up the
entropy equation.

But I wouldn't say that entropy and equilibrium are _entirely_ the same thing.
For example, take a look at the early Big Bang: it's almost completely
isothermic (that is, in complete temperature equlibrium), but its entropy is
still extremely low.

That's not the real problem with your theory, though. The real problem is
imagining that there is a force pushing things towards equilbrium. That's like
saying there's a force that causes coins to come up heads around 50% of the
time. There isn't. It's just basic probability.

Same problem here: there's nothing that forces a system towards greater
entropy--it's just far more likely to happen, because there are many orders of
magnitude of ways something can be more organized than less.

Stepp> Perhaps "probability" is just another name for this "force". And perhaps

As I find nuggets of info about these ideas out there (thanks for the pointer,
Gwynn, read that article and it was interesting) I'm finding that there is some
discussion in these areas. That the ideas of thermodynamics may be behind
everything after all, and the univere's desire for Entropy, as measured by the
number of possible arrangements of particles and the probability of these
arrangements, is at the root of everything.

I like the idea that pockets or waves of reverse entropy spring up as the
universe wobbles around perfect equilibrium. Like how ripples in a pond can
sometimes converge and cause a droplet to be shot up into the air in an unusual
display of energy. Humans and the order we see around us are one of those rare
moments in the universe, which will slowly die out as equilibrium is reached.
Then the universe dies out and ceases to exist, because time and space have no
real meaning in the absence of any disturbance of perfect equilibrium.

I also discovered the idea of "Entropic Gravity", which I find intriguing and
quite suitable to my instincts.

Interesting stuff. Hopefully I will come across a book which sums up everything
we know til now, and I can add it to my Amazon cart. I love how easy it is to

Yup, read it already. I enjoyed most of it, but found that it wandered around
at the end more than I would have liked. From what I remember, I didn't like
his tying of the measurement of Entropy to the number of different
arrangements that the particules could take while still maintaining the
original form. To me, that requires an observer - someone who can put a label
to a macro form and "recognize" it. I think we can find a better explanation
that doesn't involve subjective observations.

According to Heisenberg, conservation of energy can be violated but generally

created, the shorter they can exist before recombining into the quantum vacuum.
But if the net energy is zero or nearly zero, then they can exist for an
indefinitely large period of time. This is one way cosmologists are attempting
to make sense of the existence of dark energy.

From within our own universe, of course. But no such restraints should be
placed on a system which could simulate our universe.

I'm strangely fascinated by the idea of not being able to simulate anything to
perfect precision from within our own universe. Because like you said, as you
demand higher and higher accuracy, eventually you need to model the entire
universe itself, which is of course impossible from *within* the universe. So
we are inherently limited in the precision which we can model things. There is
a fundamental "incompleteness" in any model or simulation we make.

But I see no reason to believe that there couldn't be a bigger system, outside
of our universe, that could fully simulate it.

I'm sure Mario would think that his mushroom-filled universe could never be
modeled either. Far too complex. So many levels.

I don't think that a "bigger system" is the kind of simulation that the sort of
people who believe such things are interested in. So your hypothesis seems to
me to be more of a run around the simulation question than a real reply to it.
A "bigger system" simulating a universe is indistinguishable from a "Creator,"
or "higher dimensions."

The original simulation question is interesting because, if you accept that a
simulation is possible under the current rules of the Universe, then it becomes
likely in one sense of the word that we live in a simulation, since there could
be millions of simulations and only one "reality." I find that logic suspect,
but anyways, the point is that it's based on probability. If you have to
hypothesize a "bigger system" with rules that we have no way of knowing or
reason to think they exist, then you lose the probability argument, because
you don't have any priors from which to base the likelihood of such a universe.

There's a point to that, though. Say it HAS to be an imprecise model. So, if

just one simulation--you'd HAVE to run thousands of simulations and watch the
peturbations.

way of distinguishing between "really" seeing the sun versus seeing a very

to imagine that being all that workable.

But imagine, instead, scientists trying to figure out, "What would happen in

precise simulation. What's more, you need millions of them. After all, you're

This gets philosophical, but I often wondered what computer programs would say
about themselves. Surely they would talk about the laws of the world they exist
in, with loops, conditionals, variables, etc. This would be their reality, even
though we recognize those things as constructs of our "simulation" of some
process we are running.

I see no reason to think that we are any different, and that we could surely be
some simulation which may not even "exist" anywhere but inside of a process in
a meta-computer. And if that were the case, we would have no way of knowing.

On a different note, what if our universe really is just the other side of a
black hole in another dimension, which is leaking spacetime into ours?

It's interesting to me to think about the 'big bang' just being the initial
creation of the leak, where spacetime rushes into this new dimension and we
have expansion. Then it slows as equilibrium is reached between the two sides.

The universe continues to expand as spacetime is leaked in, and the speeding up
of expansion that we think we see could be like the last bits of spacetime
being sped up as it 'funnels' into the black hole on the other side. So we see
spacetime leaking into our universe at an increasing rate, which of course
makes it seem like our universe is expanding, and speeding up at that.

Fun to think about.

I'd think about eXistenZ or 13th Floor for simulated realities sci-fi,
especially as they manage the "simulation within a simulation" scenario.

An interesting thing is that we already do this in IT. Theoretically, a VM
works for all purposes as an exact replica of a PC, within a PC. The resources
will be less than the ones in the host PC, but the functionality will be the
same. Additionally, any slowdown in the host won't really be noticed by the
guest, except probably when doing an ntp syncing where you'd notice that your
clocks always seem to run slow.

And also, theoretically, you could be able to run a VM inside a VM...

Among all that science-fiction very likely someone has written already
something about one or more simulated universes, hopefully with a ZOOM feature

If you think that a simulation would approximate things outside our immediate
experience as point masses (or other simplifications), you are discounting the
possibility of other intelligent life in the simulation.

As long as you go that route, why assume that there is any intelligent life but
you? Why not just say this is a simulation of a single individual's experience?
It certainly simplifies everything because the simulation won't have to
actually encompass the whole universe. You experience these things second- and
third-hand through scientific literature and other sources. For you, the
experience of the universe is rather straightforward--lights in the sky, and
Newtonian mechanics here on earth.

That is the big advantage of simulation and model-making using modern
computers: You can imagine all sorts of "WHAT IF?s. For example, what if
somebody could invent a way to convert all that huge energy contained in
weather systems into usable (electric?) energy? Would that harm the growing of
food? Side effects could be terrible!

Last time I asked about this here, the concensus seemed to be it wasn't a
fractal. Except now maybe it is. Here's the original post, then I'll follow up
a bit.

Jan 26, 2013 19:21 from Gwynn
No, not a Sierpinski triangle. As I understand it, that's formed by taking a
triangle and splitting a side into thirds, basically turning each side into a
triangle, then splitting each side of the resulting triangles, and so on. The
thing I'm talking about grows from a central triangle and just forms a larger
total triangle. So:

Draw a triangle pointing upward where the length of each side is 3. Now draw
three more triangles like that, such that each base of the new triangle is
along a side of the original triangle. You'll end up with a triangle of length
6, pointing downward. Do the same thing again, each new triangle will have
length 6, and you'll end up with a triangle of length 9, pointing upward again.
I was really kind of bummed that this isn't actually a fractal, but the people
in Physics and Math, who ought to know, say it ain't. Followups to Physics and
Math, I'd guess.
[Bible And Christianity> msg #159246 (4 remaining)] Read cmd ->

So as I understand a Sierpinski triangle, you end up with a shape that's sort
of like a star or a snowflake. The thing I'm ending up with is just a larger
triangle, composed of triangles. You could do it with coins or something I
guess. Let me see if some art will help.

 o
o o
ooo
OK, that's the initial triangle. Now if we attach one to the bottom of that:

 o
o o
ooo
aaa
a a
 a

Now my powers of ASCII art fail me, but you see how you've got two more sides
of o? Attach two more triangles of A to those sides, such that the triangle
composed of three Os is surrounded by three triangles composed of As, I'm just
using the letters to show the difference. Now, you'll have a larger triangle
pointing in the opposite direction from the original, though that doesn't
really matter, with the original O triangle at the center. Now, if we attach a
triangle, let's call it B, to each side of that larger triangle, we'll end up
with an even larger triangle, and so on. The B triangles will be the size of
the new triangle composed of both O and A, and that triangle will be a layer
in, with the original O triangle at the center. You could do it all with Os of
course, I originally did this with those Buckyball magnets.

So is that a fractal? Being primarily visual things I have only the vaguest
understanding of them. Be cool if it was one, particularly since I came up with
it on my own, I know, my feats of geometric skill are amazing! I have a feeling
it's not though, because it's too regular. I think the regularity destroys the
feature where you can make it smaller and get the whole image, though it is
just triangles, so maybe not.

Another interesting point about this:  The mass emails are usually rolled out
(sent) in batches to reduce the load on the email system.  In this case, I
think that someone "put a stop to" this email before it was delivered to
everyone at the university--because only about half of the people in our office
received it.  Who received it vs. who didn't receive it doesn't seem to be cut
along student/staff/faculty lines in any way we can figure out.

It doesn't matter if UI email addresses are public record or not. The question
was whether mass messages (in this case, sent out by student groups) had to go
through an approval process before they're sent. They do, and yet this one was
still allowed to pass by someone. I'm guessing it barely got a skim before they
stamped it.

It was not sent out from a university email address, was more than 20 lines
long, and did not have the right disclaimer at the bottom.
It had a disclaimer, but not the required one for mass emails.
The university email requirement is only for RSOs (I think ISCA had this issue
a few years ago when we wanted to send out a mass email and had to get someone
with a university email to originate it). There also has to be a non-email
contact in the email (phone or address).
Violating the line limit is the glaring one, since the request system makes you
enter the email into a length limited box (20 lines of no more than 70
characters each, with blank lines counting).

When I read all these posts about the various rules which govern these things,
it sounds like internal University policies.  None of this would mean 'boo' to
someone who wasn't an employee or student, right?  I mean, I could send 10,000

Chloe was born October 2010 and is just under 10 months old - she is a Jack
Russell, Beagle, and Mini Schnauzer mix. She comes with a leash, Iams puppy
food, bowls, treats. She's very energetic and knows a few commands like sit and
speak. She needs a family that can play with her a lot and give her good walks.
My MIL has trouble walking and can't help Chloe burn off her energy. If anyone
here knows someone who'd like a new puppy in the Iowa City, Coralville, heck
we'll even take her to Cedar Rapids if needed.

Please send me mail.
Thank you.
We are looking to rehome her this week if possible.

Went to Heirloom for lunch, which I had eagerly anticipated: I enjoyed
similar restaurants in other cities, but was quite disappointed with
Iowa City's version. In addition to the high price (complained about by
everyone) it's also designed to be very slow: the overly-complicated
ingredient pricing means that everyone has to think really hard about what
they want ("do I really want to spend $1.29 on a couple of mozzarella balls,
or do I want to spend $0.59 on a few apple cubes?  Hm... now that I can see
the ingredients, let me figure this out while everyone else waits on me").
After building your salad, they then write down what you put in, give you the
sheet, and then the cashier uses the sheet to *re-enter* it into the cash
register. Not by price category, no -- they have to go screen-by-screen and
tell the cash register exactly what you had on a salad.

It's like they tried really hard to mess up the simple concept of a salad
bar.  And succeeded.

Yeah.  It's a clone of a bunch of places in NYC and other cities where you
walk in, tell them what you want in your salad, and they make it and toss
it and give it to you.  It's fast, healthy, and you get a tossed salad
far faster than you can go through a salad bar line.

Except here it's amazingly slow, shockingly expensive, and -- frankly -- not
very good.

Kind of a gripe, but an FYI to those in the area. I had Chambers electric give
me a quote on running new coax in my house. One run to my living room, and one
to the master bed room so we could get directv. (house was built in 92, and
they used rg-59) So, I go the quote, and elected to have it done. Not very
happy at all. I was told they used my the amount on the quote just foe the
living room run, which was by far the easiest. It would cost more than double
to actually do the work that they come to my home to look over to provide an
estimate for. I know things can go wrong, unforseen things etc etc, but to
double the quote? Sounds like he did the quote on the best possible
circumstances. I tell them to finish up with the one run, and call it quits.
They walk out saying it was all done. I did a walk around, found an air return
cover still sitting o nthe floor. They pulled a can light from my ceiling, and
did not put it back in right. They gouged one of my walls. I was told they
normally have spackle on them for when they have problems cutting openings etc,
but they forgot it on this job. So, my living room cable plate is holding a
chunk of painted drywall in place.
This was just an unbelievably poor showing on their part. As for the estimate
(again) if the estimate was for 250, and was going to be 500, that equals
pissed off. If the esimtate was for 400, and ended up being 500, that equals a
bit upset, but more likely to have the work done.

I talked with a school teacher / Penn parent today. The heat-index
early-releases (there is another one today at 12:55, for those of you planning
for traffic), are because of the schools that do not have AC, or do not have 
AC
everywhere (Penn has classrooms with none, and classrooms with AC, both), that
share busses with other schools. 
 
So, instead of a money-saving deal with the energy companies, it seems that it
is a fairness issue for the schools with little climate control. (And maybe a
sidebar of the Durham buslines contract, saying the district can not add too
many extra trips onto the contract...? Anyone know how to check that idea?)

Durham company is limited by the way the routes are constructed.  The school
district was supposed to stagger release times for the schools - high schools
shouldn't release before 3:30, but they're out at 3:15.  Makes it difficult to
do routes that catch grade school, then high school.  Given that Durham is also
restricted by the number of buses the district will pay to run (each bus
requires a driver and, in many cases, an associate), you've got a quandry.
Currently, Durham runs 105 routes that cover IC, Coralville, North Liberty, and
Hills.

Now if Durham agreed to bus just from those schools without AC, then had the
buses return to pick up other schools, in many routes, the pick-up and drop-off
times would be messed up considerably.  Some of these routes are LONG - drivers
go to Hills, then pick up kids in two or three neighborhoods, before heading to
City or West.  My son's bus picks up kids in Manville Heights, then goes to
University Heights and hits a lot of stops between.  Many drivers are on the
road up to 3 hours per run.  By contract, drivers get paid a minimum of 2 hours
per drive, whether they drive that long or not - some cushy routes only take an
hour at a time, some even less.

The logistics of just running the routes from two or three schools on a hot day
are just too complex.  Instead of paying drivers for some routes extra and
hoping that they are available to drive at odd times, Durham just runs the
whole route two hours early.  I can see their point.

Smoke Eater>
I think this might have been covered already, but neither myself or JL are
talking about throwing away normalized scheme.  Just creating caches of data
optimized for reads.  It doesn't really matter if it's denormalized or not,
the important concept is that you have one set of schema for writing data, and
another set entirely for reading data, and while you now require a mechanism to
transfer data from the write side to the read caches, you're afforded the
opportunity to optimize each schema for their respective tasks.

In many cases, data that is written doesn't need to transition into the read
caches instantly, and sometimes it's very valuable to prevent its transition
automatically or to schedule it at an appropriate time.  Instead of having to
build more schema to handle visibility, it's a matter of exposing the data at
all...  Just one of many myriad fringe benefits from moving away to a single
monolithic schema to rule all use cases.                         ^-to +from

Unfortunately "the cloud" is still in its infancy. Nobody really trusts it yet
or feels the need for it; it seems like a public swimming pool when everyone
already has their own private pool with hot tub. Those of in technology know
it's just another name for a file share. So we're all skeptical.  But
cost-wise, yeah, cloud services seem like they ought to be a no-brainer.

Cloud in practice> I work in business intelligence for a large insurance
company. We are utilizing amazon cloud to host our statistica data modelling
work for big data. We encrypt vast chunks of data, put it up there, run our
statistica models against it, allowing the cloud to absorb the massive space
requirements. We certainly wouldn't put unencrypted data up there, we are
careful not to include any PII, and we use our own encryption instead of
relying on amazon. That said, we bought tools like statistica that allow us the
flexibility to do so.

The reason we are doing this is because the hardware costs in company are so
outrageously inflated its crazy. We outsourced management and build of our data
centers to CSC, and their costs for new hardware and support are insanity
personified.

The biggest concerns are always security. We feel somehow more secure to know
the data is on a box in a data center in our building, and we feel unsecure to
know the data is on a mystery box in some amazon center where its staring the
box with dozens of other peoples data. But in reality, its equally unsecure in
both places really.

Our systems guys claim it is not really any cheaper to host in the cloud versus
internally. I could definitely see where an externally-managed data center

Your hosting contracts should contain service levels pertaining to data

use is high and most of it is used by internal employees.

There really is not enough information here to say with any certainty why
things have slowed. Unless you have a lot of activity including deletions,
shrinking may not accomplish anything, though using table compression might. It
also matters what is in each row as well as having 11 million of them, and
which columns you have indexed and what your queries are asking for. You should
monitor the database for resource constraints to see what you need to tune.

  RAM is an order of magnatude faster than disk, so having your DB use
  more RAM is better. Having the entire DB in memory would be the best.

  Having a smaller overall DB will allow you to more easily fit it
  into memory.

  'compacting' the db doesn't sound like a performance optimization, but
  a space one. Having a smaller DB that is _compressed_ will make things
  _slower_ as it will need to spend _more_ CPU cycles to decompress it
  when you want to do anything wth the data.
  'compacting' the db to expunge deleted rows, might be useful.

  'db response times seem to have degraded.'
  What have you measured to confirm this?
  Inserts? Reads? Deletes? Updates? All of the above?
  Just "feels" slower or is slower?
  Run a "profiler" to see what's slow.

  I don't know SQL Server hardly at all, but maybe you can tell it to not
  put the big ass 11 million row table in memory because you don't need
  it to be fast, but the others you do want in memory.
  Indexes! Takes up some (small) amount of space, but will improve perf.

  This is MS we're talking about, try a reboot! Or at least a stop/start
  service.

Looking for thoughts on a general data storage concept...

In a particular database I'm working with, these seems to be three kinds of
data:
 - Static data attached to entities, like names and other really defining
   attributes.
 - Attributes that change over time, such as a clasification which might be
   "A" this month, but "B" next month.
 - Attributes that change over time *and* are weighted, such that this month
   an entity might be 25% A and 75% B, but next month be 50% A and 50% B.

I've noticed that when the client wants to capture new data about entities,
they often think it's of type #1. Simple. Add a column.

Then over time, they often realize it's actually #2. Fine. Break it into a new
table with a time state. Kind of a bother.

Then after more time, they realize that it's REALLY #3, which gives them total
flexibility. But it's a big pain in the ass to refactor to that.


Have you guys often found this to be the case? Something that a client thinks
is a static attribute turns out to be dynamic over time, and often weighted
between different attributes?


Is there value in designing a system such that *most* fields are of type #3?
And if it really is a static field, then it's just 100% weighted for all time
states? Then the system always knows how to query everything, and all data is
of the same type.


This also goes down the rabbit hole of EAV, which I'm also tossing around in my
mind.

In the end, this client needs a system that can hold dynamic data, with
attributes that change frequently as different data is collected. It doesn't
lend itself well to a typical, rigid, structured table design. I'm curious to
know what other people do.

Need some help doing a complex query...right now, it looks like I want to do
multiple nexted selects, but I can't do that.  I'll try to explain what I want.


I want all charges and payments associated with specific visits, where payments
were made, but not a visit meeting specific criteria.


Select
    All charges and payments
From
    Appropriate tables
Where
    Insurance & date criteria is met And
    Visit is in
    ( Select
          All payments                  ; Will be same payments above
      From

      Where
          Same Insurance & date criteria is met And
          Visit is NOT in

            From
                Same appropriate tables
            Where
                Same Insurance & date criteria is met And
                Specific charge criteria is met
          )
    )


So if the data was as follows:

Visit   Charge/Payment    Charge/Payment_Type        Amount
1       Charge               Doesn't meet criteria 100.00
2       Charge               Doesn't meet criteria 150.00
2       Payment             Paid on Account            50.00
3       Charge               Meets criteria               200.00
3       Payment             Paid on Account            25.00

So, visit 1 is right out since no payments were made on it.  Visit 3 is out
since the charge associated with the visit meets the criteria.  I want the
visit 2 charge and payment lines.  The result I want would be:

2       Charge               Doesn't meet criteria 150.00
2       Payment             Paid on Account            50.00


I hope that all makes sense.  It's really convoluted I know, and it's hard for
me to even keep up with.  I need to come up with a couple different variants of
this even, but once I have the concept, I think I can adapt it.

Thanks in advance for any help!

Or actually, now that I looked at it again, it appears I can nest that many

Smoke Eater> Correct me if I'm wrong here: you have two problems to solve. The
first is you have the field separator (commas) in your data, which MSSQL
doesn't support. Second, some fields are quoted while others are not, which
MSSQL doesn't support. Right?

I think there is a simple solution. First quote everything, then fix the
field terminators.

1. Quote everything:

      s/^([^",]+),/"$1",/g    ## Quote unquoted initial fields.
      s/,([^",]+)/"$1"/g      ## Quote unquoted fields.

2. Now replace this 3-char pattern "," with a new delimeter, say, "@".

      s/","/"@"/g

Assumptions:
    a) The 3-char pattern "," does not exist in the original CSV.
    b) The chosen delimeter @ does not exists in the original CSV.
    c) The original CSV does not contain entirely empty fields,
       as in  3,8,7,,,,,,,,,,,9


JL> Could you explain #3? When you say the attributes are weighted, do you
mean this, where `Color` is some attribute for an Entity.

       Color (
            entity_id,
            color_weight,
            value
       )

If the question is about changing requirements, then the solution is to
construct your system so that change is EXPECTED, but not BUILT-IN. That means
construct a system where tomorrow's changes will go smoothly, although you
have no idea WHAT the change will be.  But don't fall into the trap of trying
to build a meta-system where the app can alter its own schema or where the app
data is really meta-data for an app that might exist tomorrow. The trap is
trying to predict tomorrow's requirements then hard-coding them into today's
app. Not sure if that's what you were getting at when you mentioned the
EAV rabbit hole, but I think that's the mistake a lot of people make when
considering EAV.

JP> I'm imagining an attribute value being applied to an entity in a very
general way:

Table: MY_AWESOME_EAV_TABLE

  EntityType,
  EntityId,
  AttributeName,
  AttributeValue,
  EffectiveDate,
  Weight

So a specificy entity, on a specific date, might have two rows for attribute
"COLOR" - one with "RED" at 50% weight, and one with "BLUE" at 50% weight.

A more static value which might traditionally be a column in a table would be a
single row with a value and weight of 100%. Because you think it won't change
over time, but when it does, it will be easily supported. And you might think
that the entity can always be classified distinctly, but if you suddenly
realize that it's not just A, but a blend of A and B, that is supported also.

This is all-in EAV, I know. I wondering where the balance is between a
traditional, structured table model and a pure EAV model.

I've never gone down the EAV rabbit hole except for storing arbitrary/random
"tags" to entities, which are never used in queries or reports.

But the idea of diving into EAV intrigues me. I've talked to some people who
have implemented it very successfully in big financial systems, so it has
merit. Just trying to think through it.

BODY: 
From a data perspective, EAV is designed for the case when the number of
*possible* attributes that any entity may have is very large compared to the
expected number of attributes that any *specific* entity actually has. The
classic example is where the entity is medical patient, and the attributes are
specific tests that a patient has undergone. The possible number of
medical/lab tests any human can experience is, say, in the hundreds of
thousands. The expected number of tests any specific patient will undergo is a
dozen or so.

From a modeling perspective, EAV is designed for the case when the attributes
themselves are completely generic, i.e., the system doesn't care what they
mean at all or have any special logic to handle one attribute over another.
An example would be the fact that the application doesn't care if a test was
for strep throat or a sinus infection; the app only sees meaningless strings
"strep throat" and "sinus infection", that could be anything. A
counter-example is a shopping cart system where the "price" attribute has a
different meaning to the system than the "color" attribute, because it needs
special logic. Price is a poor candidate for EAV, but "color" is a good
candidate.

In practice, I believe the "generic-ness" of the attributes is THE ONE TRUE
CRUCIAL CHARACTERISTIC that should be maintained for EAV to be useful over a
more direct approach. If the attributes are generic, then queries and system
logic will be generic, and the EAV approach may be a lot simpler than a direct
approach.  If the attributes are not generic, and require specific case logic,
the system begins to degrade to WORSE than a relational model, because there
is an extra layer of meta-crap you have to go through to get your data.

I've worked with EAV systems. The queries are a royal pain in the ass as soon
as you need to manipulate specific attributes.  In THEORY, all you need are
three tables, Entity, Attr, Value. In reality, you have several layers of EAV
on top of each other. For example, you might have "Patient" which is the
entity for an EAV system.  One of the attributes of that system is "Lab_Test".
But Lab_Test is also an entity for its own little EAV system as well.  Within
Lab_Test, you have an EAV system for all the possible weird attributes of lab
tests, such as Date, Location, Administering Attendant, Insurance Codes, etc.
In an EAV system everything that has a tie to something else is not tied
directly as it would be in an RDBMS. Instead, it's indirectly linked via a
massive generic "this Attribute belongs to this Entity" mapping.  You can see
how you can blow up your whole system into an over-generic mess if you don't
keep the meta-madness at bay.

Ah, storing entities as values within EAV seems like a disaster. I would
imagine using EAV only for actual attributes of entities, not for any kind of
relationship mapping. EAV as a replacement for columns, not as a replacement
for foreign keys.

I do fear going too "meta". Next thing you know, everything will be defined in
XML. There is a balance somewhere. I think.

The value in EAV to me is flexibility. Right now, if the client wants to store
a new attribute, they wait 2 months until the next release cycle, and the db
schema changes. With EAV, they just add a new attribute and value and they are
done. It's appealing. It supports a more flexible and fast-paced business.

Also, I imagine that queries fall apart with EAV. Instead of directly accessing
the DB, everything would go through an app/services layer which would pivot the
EAV into more useful column-like structures. Hopefully no one would query the
EAV tables directly. They would always go through the application logic, since
that's the only place you could enforce any business/integrity rules.

Finally, I'd want to cache the whole damn thing. The whole EAV structure in
memory, all the time. When the app starts, it gets dumped into memory and
pivoted/hashed. That makes access quick and convenient, but introduces caching
challenges.

All objects are entities in this sense, and have attributes and values. Want a
new one? Add it to the schema attributeTypes. Of course, you have to assign
that attribute as a possibility to the objectClass you're using. But once
you've done that, wham. You get your flexible attribute model, a LISPy query

Well, that's not a technology problem, so EAV can't solve it.  You could just
as easily give the client access to change the relational schema as the EAV
schema.

I have had very limited exposure to EAV systems over my career. It seems to me
like the value would be very dependent on how the database is going to be used,
and by who using what tools. If this is a reporting database intended to be
used by business people, I would think they are going to need to be pretty
technical to make it work. In a similar vein, I would think tools that "know"
how to use such an approach are going to be pretty scarce. If it is for IT type
people to use, for reporting or an application or whatever, maybe the increased
flexibility will make it worthwhile.
Of the few times I have seen it done, most of the IT folk considered them a
royal PITA to work with, particularly in integration scenarios. Users did
generally like the functionality and flexibility.

IMO, the misinformation problem is due to that fact that SQL language is a
quirky implementation of a more sensible theory. And to make things worse, SQL
doesn't really match the theory, either, in functionality or notation. So you
get developers who want to learn, but run into a brick wall at every turn.

In Date's and Codd's taxonomy, the terms are listed below. I put the commonly
used SQL name, roughly but not exactly equivalent, in [brackets].

 RELVAR    a relation-valued variable.                            [variable  ]
 RELATION  a HEADER and a BODY.                                   [table     ]
 HEADER    an unordered set of ATTRIBUTES.                        [schema    ]
 ATTRIBUTE a unique NAME along with a DOMAIN.                     [column    ]
 DOMAIN    any type, including other relations!                   [type      ]
 BODY      unordered set of unique TUPLES.                        [recordset ]
 TUPLE     tuple of components matching the ATTRIBUTES.           [row       ]
 PROJECTION   a subset of ATTRIBUTES.                             [select    ]
 RESTRICTION  a subset of TUPLES.                                 [where     ]

Date's terminology is more sensible because it describes properties and allows
the relations to be defined based on other relations.  SQL's terminology seems
more like someone was looking at a spreadsheet and just read off what they
were looking at: "I see a table with rows and columns." But in reality, we
have to use SQL, and the SQL terms imply things that aren't quite correct.

Ever have a meeting where you can't agree on technology because half the
people in the room subscribe to bogus performance myths?

When the SQL Server DBAs and .NET developers learned that a *nix/MySQL app
talks to the DB via prepared SQL statements (as opposed to call stored
procedures), their jaws hit the table. They immediately pounced and wanted
everything converted to SPs -- tens of thousands of SPs.  We recoiled:
What...The...Fuck...For?  They responded by citing performance reasons.  You
see, according to their math, if you prepare an SQL statement, that's one
round-trip. Then you need to execute the prepared statement, and that's a
second round-trip!  One of the DBAs actually said he's watched the network I/O
and verified this. Wow. And to think we pay them for that analysis.

But it gets better. They trotted out an example of a .NET app they
"optimized." The .NET app made 360 INSERTs in a row (the amortization schedule
of a mortgage product). That was 360 round-trips. They optimized it by having
the app serialize its data in an ad-hoc format, then INSERT it as a single
opaque blob. That's right. 360 rows of data, now in a BLOB. Genius!!

Tomorrow I start calling recruiters. :)

something. Too freaking bad. It's not. The SQL for module X is in module X. I
asked if the SQL is all in one place in the DB. What?

In another example, they insisted that having everything in SPs allows them
alter the schema without having to alter the app because the app wouldn't have
to know about the tables or columns. Ok, in theory, yes, you could swap out a
yellow shoe on your left foot and your right foot would not know the
difference.  I asked if they ever actually did that: did they ever change the
underlying tables without an app or SP API change to go with it.  No, they
never have done that. But they COULD!

applicable. Compress? Yes always compress data. Index? Yes, always place

I was in an meeting today where the SQL Server DBAs tried to paint some of our
MySQL schemas as "wrong" because the schemas contain circular references.
They insisted that circular references were a bad design, and they had drawn
up a proposal for a complex and costly plan to "fix" the schema.

Just like a couple weeks ago, my jaw hit the table. Are you clowns f-ing
serious with this?  Circular references are part of the design; they fall
right out of the model. If you ask brokers and other officers to describe
their domain, they will, in English, describe a circularly referential model.
You'd have to go out of your way to concoct a convoluted schema for this
application domain that doesn't have circular references.  It was never an
issue before, not a blip, in years of production.  MySQL, Oracle, and
PostgreSQL handle circular references just fine.

Yet they persisted in their bizarre crusade against circular references.  I
kept firing back because they were making no sense. Is your friend on Facebook
friends with someone who is friends with you? Of course.

Eventually, the truth came out: MS SQL Server doesn't support circular
references! e.g., in cascade deletes. That was the true motivation behind
their crusade.  A shortcoming in SQL Server. So in the end, the DBAs were
convinced that circular references are "wrong", based on the fact SQL Server
doesn't support them. Well, at least according to these guys... I can't be
sure.

Does anyone here know whether SQL Server does, in fact, support circular
references?  For example: Alice's best friend is Bob; Bob's best friend is
Chuck, and Chuck's best friend is Alice. Smith's doctor is Miller, and
Miller's doctor is Smith.

checking to the point a transaction is committed. That's why you can't simply
INSERT a circular reference without employing one of the two hacks I posted.
But you most certainly can have circular references with constraints in MySQL.
The easy solution is to allow NULLs. Then there's no problem at all and
constraints are enforced.

I thought of one ugly hack to get deferred constraint checking. It would suck
in practice. But you could run it in non-production environments as a sanity
check. Create another table that has a single column: the foreign key column
from the table you want to check, then INSERT the fk values into the 2nd table
as well. It could be done in a way to minimize the performance penalty, but
it's still ugly.

There's an important distinction to be made in the circular references
discussion.
        There's the case where the graph modeling the "table A has a foreign
key referencing table B" has cycles in it.
        And then there's the case where there are cycles in the graph that
models which record references which other records.
        The second case obviously can't happen without the first, but the first
can happen without the second. For example, in the already cited example of
which forum post is a response to which other post, the posts table has a
foreign key to itself, but (in an uncorrupted database) no post is directly or
indirectly a response to itself.
        It's been long since I have done any database work, but I'd be somewhat
surprised if MSSQL could not fully support the former. Does it indeed entirely
forbid cascading deletes on tables where the table depdendency graph has cycles
in it?

In our DB, we soft-delete records, with a DELETED_FLAG column of Y or N.

It's a PITA, because in 90% of our queries, we have to include

Is there a cool way around this? Like, to tell the DB to only consider rows
where DELETED_FLAG='N' *except* if I specifically ask for them?

1) I know this would depend on DB. We are still Sybase, hoping to move to
   Oracle 11g this year.
2) I could do some data archiving to a DELETED table itself when rows are soft
   deleted, but then the cascade of foreign key dependencies is complex.
3) I could make a VIEW, but I am still then having to go to different tables
   depending on whether I want to consider deleted items or not, and I have to
   UNION them if I want both.

I don't know if there is any cool solution to this, but I thought I'd just

Compliance reasons. Data cannot be hard deleted. Also, because there are a lot
of foreign keys to lots of other transactional tables, and untangling the
cascade of complex relationships in order to move all relevant records to
another table is not possible.

For example, Entity A got money from Entity B in the past, so a record exists
in the transaction table for $$$ from B to A. If B is no longer a valid entity,
I cannot remove it without also removing the row from the transaction table.
And if I ever want to look back in the past to see where the money came from, I
need to tie it back to some entity.

So I need it there, but I don't want it to show up everywhere else in the
system ins earch results, lists, reports, etc. So it gets soft deleted.

> If you make a view with only the non-deleted records

Yes, I mentioned that. But then I still have the complexity of switching tables
depending on what kind of data I want, and that could potentially touch 90% of
the queries in the system. Especially since so many different types of tables
have DELETED_FLAG columns. Flipping between "all" and "current" for each table
and dynamically creating queries seems like a mess.

  Sounds like you're kinda stuck if you don't like the view option.

  Something I thought of: if the majority of your queries require
  deleted="n", maybe you could flip the flag...hrm...not sure how.
  Idea being, only has the "deleted" records show up if you include the
  flag in your query....deleted is not null ..maybe...?

It's no different than querying based on whether the user is in "Canada" or
likes "green shoes". It's really what VIEWS are for, but I can also see why
VIEWS can be an added burden.

One alternative to having an IS_DELETED flag is to add the PKs to a separate
"Deleted" table (or an "Active" table, or both). The Deleted (or Active) table
would only have a single column, and the column would be a cascading delete
foreign key. To mark a row for deletion, you INSERT its PK into the "Deleted"
table (or delete its PK from the "Active" table).  Queries would JOIN on the
table it wants.  I think this is slightly cleaner than the IS_DELETED flag.
But it doesn't solve the overall problem that you'd like to somehow omit rows
by default.

Me: Hey IT, I have a project that uses Entity Framework I would like to
    deploy to production, but I noticed that dev and stage are SQL Server
    2008 R2 and prod is SQL Server 2000. SQL Server 2000 is not compatible
    with Entity Framework. Can you upgrade this server to 2008 R2? It looks
    like this was an upgrade project that was started by someone else and
    never finished.

IT: Why do you need to do this?  This hardware is very old and we'd like to
    retire it.  You need to justify new hardware: What is this for? What is
    the backup schedule? What is the CPU load? Why isn't this combined with
    other servers?

Me: You've never asked us these questions before? Can't we just use the
    same justification for the existing server?  I can answer these questions,
    but I'm going to need more access to the box.

*Time passes, lots of meetings*

Me: Here's the information you asked for.  Also, now that I can see everything
    we've identified a lot of databases on this machine that were either
    never used or haven't been used in years.

IT: We looked at your list and we agree. What is your plan to retire all
    these databases?

Me: Uh, most of these things are owned by your team: sharepoint, asset
    tracking, etc.  I would say we should run a trace for 30 days and
    verify that nothing is hitting these databases.

IT: Okay, we can do that.  We'll get back with you when the trace is done.

*Four Months Pass*

Me: Did you guys ever do that trace?

IT: Oh shit.  Sorry, we forgot.  Uh, we don't have time, can you see if
    the DBE can do it?

*DBE makes trace script/plan asks IT to execute. Two months pass.*

IT: Hey, we started running that trace on that box.  Did you know it's
    SQL 2000?  We'd like to upgrade it to 2008 R2 at least.  Also, it's
    almost out of space and there are a bunch of databases that don't
    appear to be used.  Do you know if we can just delete these?

   HAHAHAHA
  Is "IT" the same person or different people? seems likely the latter...

Stilgar> What I read from that is,

    Before we can deploy to production, we need a simple, mundane I.T. task to
    be done. Then SIX MONTHS pass and I.T. has not done it.

I feel your pain.  I say find a new job.  You can't change a culture of lazy,
stupid people; that sort of culture is bred from the top down. (And dump your
stock, too.)

It's different IT people.  They have no communication over there.  I am
considering submitting it to WTF because I also thought it was a perfect
fit.

The rest of this is off-topic for this forum, but related to our IT dept...

One of the other product teams was deploying a change that removed dependancy
on public folders on our Exchange server.  Because their service integrates
with some of ours an end-to-end test requires our dev env shit working.  We
were paused on a half-finsihed project that touched on these systems, so I
spent two days going through and making them functional again.

I needed help from IT to fix some of these issues because they weren't all
things I could fix...like a broken DNS record for example.  Normally I'd open
tickets for this stuff, but it was my understanding that this was critical, so
I packed up my laptop and went over to IT so I could just bug them when I
needed something.

While I'm over there working with this guy, the manager walks by, and the guy
I'm working with says, "Hey Brian. I'm probably not going to get to <some
project> because I've been busy doing other stuff like helping Stilgar."  Brian
looks and me and asks what I'm doing and if it's critical.  I explain and he
says, "that's not critical" and tells me to go away. I tell the other product
team that I can't help them anymore because IT said it's not important.

THE NEXT DAY the other product team comes back to me and says that IT is
planning on removing the public folders by the end of the week so we need to
get the fixes tested and rolled out to production ASAP.

WTF.  I just sent an email to all the product managers involved to let
them battle it out.

  As I pointed out in WWW, I don't want to become IT, but not submitting a
  ticket was a mistake.

Heh. 2 years ago, the place where I was working was generating WTF-worthy
material on a monthly basis. One of the "best" things was:

- MS "consulting" dude, a supposed SQL Server expert tells us that we should
switch all our Production DBs to the Simple recovery model. Back then, I had no
idea what that did, so we trusted the Expert. We also implement a daily full
backup.
- The "IT Security" dude implements an auditing thingy that requires enabling
C2 Auditing on SQL Server. We had enabled that before, but turned it off
because it would fill the filesystem with junk trace dumps that captured
everything, but the product demanded that we do that. OK, enabled.

Of course, this means that we all had to check out the FS to see if we were
running out of space, then delete the exess auditlogs. And by "all of us", of
course it was only me that checked the FS.

Months later, I take a couple of days out. I guess you get where all of this is
going...

The day I come back to work, at about 11:30, BAM. The one database with tons of
activity starts shitting itself, taking down the app that uses it. An app,
which about 400 employees need to use for their daily work. We take down SQL
Server, restart, then find out that all DBs except that one are OK. DBCC tells
us that the data is corrupted beyond repair. After a meeting where we all got
slammed ... I finally find out. The auditlogs had never been purged in my 3-day
leave and had filled the FS .. the one where the MDB lived. Someone else found
out before me, but deleted 'em to cover their ass; however my monitoring
process had still registered the 99% used stat right before everything went to
hell (and how that particular monitoring DB survived is a mystery.)

So I say, no problem, just restore the DB and I'll run today's transaction log.
This is where the "SQL expert" screwed us over: Simple Recovery model means
there's no such transaction log, as it is truncated as soon as stuff gets
comitted. We lost an entire day's work.

The upshot is that I was designated as the SQL DBA (something that was mostly
unofficial up to that day) and my first changes consisted in:

- Switching off the stupid C2 auditing
- Switching all DBs to the Full Recovery Model
- Changing our backup procs to do full nightly backups, and hourly transaction
log backups.

By the way, the app that made us enable C2 auditing was no longer used. The IT
Security guy used it for like 15 days and then threw it away. But he never
bothered to tell us!!!

I have a Tiel about 10 probably.  I rescued him and I've had him about 8 years
so not exactly sure of his age.  He's as sweet as the day is long.  He says his
name (Rikko).  I also have a 12-year-old lovebird and a 23-year-old Senegal
parrot.  The lovebird is the little bitey guy, Rikko is pretty mellow but
doesn't like being held much.  He'll step up when he's out of his cage and it's
time to go back in.  Baby (the Senegal) has started doing this thing where when
I'm petting her neck she will put my finger in her mouth and puke up this
watery snot-like liquid.  Everyone tells me it's her way of showing me love.
Ick!  I adopted her almost a year ago from the family who had had her the whole
23 years.  She'll be 24 in November and she still crawls up-side-down in her
cage and says "hi" and "hi Baby" and oy and makes little noises that I repeat,
mostly that's a bedtime thing.

But none (well except Peeps the lovebird) are very crotchety I guess.  They're
all so different and they all have different needs.  They LOVE popcorn - it's
the treat of the week.  The Tiel and the lovebird live in the same cage.  It's
fun to watch them groom each other.  They are besties.  Someone was amazed when
I told them a Tiel and lovebird were pals.  She tried to tell me it's
impossible. They've shared the cage for 8 years.  Before that I had another
lovebird, walked into the bedroom one morning and found him dead at the bottom
of the cage.

Birds live a looooooong time when they are properly handled and cared for.
Sorry your baby is ornery but I suppose that's what happens as they get older.
I guess lovebirds live to be around 12-15.  Every morning I fear when I uncover
them that Peeps will be gone.  I don't know why I have such fear about it.  I
love my birds!

My lab has a pea size raised bump on her back.  It looked on Friday to be a bit
fuild filled.  Now it is just getting harder and not as fluid filled as before.
Had my brother look at it Saturday and he said that it didn't look like an in
grown hair, but something that needed to be lancted.
Any idea what this could be?  It is pea size, it was white/clear color on
Friday, now it is more white/redish color.  I can see a small part of it raised
above it that seems to be fluid filled.  It is kinda hard in texture with a
little sponge to it but not much.

Going to the vet in the morning.  Just curious if this is going to cost me a
lot of money.  I would have thought it would have gone down since Friday.

Sometimes dogs get growths. I can't recall what it is called, but Roark had a
pea sized growth similar to what you describe. It was on his face, so not a lot
of skin and fat to hide it. We went ot the vet, he himmed and hawed. He said
that young dogs tend to get these things. I'm sure Moontoad knows that it's
called :) Anyways, if it's this fluid thing it tends to get reabsorbed and go
away on its own. He thought it *looked* like that, but Roark is older, so it
didn't quite add up. Asked what we'd want to do and offered that if it was his
dog he'd just nick it off with some local anesthesia. We decided to get it
removed - then had to cancel for some craziness. :) Long story short, it did go
away on its own and was exactly what he'd described.
So you could save yourself some money by making a note of the date and size (in
millimeters if possible) and a few notes about the consistency and such, and
just track it. If it grows a bunch, definitely get in. If it stays the same,
watch it. And if it starts going away, then it's likely that fluid thing. Your
dog is still rather young and likely that's what it is.

Thanks Kyoti> I was thinking of going straight to the vet tomorrow but I was
afraid of overreacting.  I'm going to look at it in the morning. It seems more
red today but it might be because we noticed it and been feeling it more often.
The dog is not bothered by it at all. Never phased and she is as happy as
always playing and everything.  How long do you expect this to take to go away?
I am not the type to overreact but I also do not want to prolong something.

Unfortunately, mast cell tumors can look like that.  And there's no way of you
knowing what it is unless you've seen it before.  The good thing is that if it
is a tumor, and it's small enough, they can remove it with a clear margin and
you just go about your life like you did before, making sure you get all lumps
checked after that (they can just stick a needle in and try to draw some gunk
out and look at it under a microscope).  I took care of my brother's dog that
died of MCT when he was 3.  He was an unusual case, but he had been badly
neglected and starved as a puppy and my brother had him for about two years,
and it was probably a crappy immune system due to the abuse he had early in
life.

If you google mast cell tumors and look at the images, there's a variety of
them to compare yours to.

Well that was $60 of learning what I already thought it was a Subaceous cyst.
Vet said this is common and could end up with several of them over time.  He
said he normally will remove them when a dog has teeth cleaning when they are
much older.  They still do not have Interceptor, said it should be coming back
in a few months.  I am not holding my breath on that one.
Oh he also said if she gets anymore of these there is no need to come in for a
visit.  Obviously if they don't look white fluid filled and she isn't bothered
by it then no biggie.  Just to have them looked at during vaccine time.

Better to be safe than sorry is my moto.

Tonight I lost my original boy cat Iolaus.
It had seemed that old age was catching up to him as his appetite was
diminished and he seemed to want to sleep (usually on me) more often. Earlier
tonight he'd declined the food offered him in favor of sleeping on my lap. It
was while we were lying on my bed, him next to me but on my right arm) that I
could sense the end was near. A little later he slept on my chest then back by
my side (same place). He had a bit of a back leg spasm (like he was scratching
an itch) then he seemed to calm back down. I checked and he was sleeping. A
little later he took several deep breaths, each followed by shallow (normal it
seemed to me) ones. Finally he just slipped away. He just felt different so I
checked and could feel no heartbea or breathing. I held my head to his side to
double check and he was gone.
Earlier I'd given him permission to go if it was his time. I'd said I hoped
he'd stick around for a long time but that I'd understand if he had to go.
I cried lots and called my Mom to share with her. I let all the other kitties
know about our loss as well.
I then wrapped him in an old shirt of mine, used a new (big) shoebox for a
coffin, duct taping it shut, and buried him next to Ashe under the tree in the
back yard. I had a little service for him as well.
*Sighs* I am gonna miss Iolaus. Only cat i've had longer (by a week) is Mocha.
Of all of us I am sure she feels this loss the most as they grew up together.
Miss Kitty and Iolaus had daughters so I know they'll feel it. Finally, Iolaus
had adopted Midnight as his son. They played together and sometimes slept
together. I know Midnight feels it as he is staying by me (still in the clothes
I wore when with Iolaus).
*sighs* I never am ready to lose a friend.

Silly question.  Do you have to replace dog nail clippers often? It seems like
it is getting harder and harder to trim the dog's nails.  The clippers are now
over a year old.  They are the good ones. I believe Millers? They have the
orange handles to them.  You would think after a year of trimming this dog's
nails it would get easier for her to adjust but she is just not happy about the
entire process every time I do it. I know I'm bitchin' but this is the one task
that is not fun.  It also seems that her quick is way too long and I trim them
often.  Her nails just continue to click on the floor and I do not believe this
is good for her.

OH, and some dogs' nails just grow fucking fast.  I have to trim my female's

from trimmed stubbs to talons in a week, so I suspect he's the same.  He's
going to be huge when he grows up, he's 12 weeks old and already over half the

Litter

  WTF is up with our cat?
  History:
  Sept 1 I clean litter box A. I take all the litter out, take the box outside
  and wash it down, rinse, let it dry overnight.
  Sept 15, I clean litter box B. Same as above.

  Of course I'm shifting in between.
  And I'm noticing Box A isn't getting used.

  Oct 1, I am ready to repeat the outdoor cleaning on box A and it pretty
  much is not getting used, there's no point.
  Box B is filthy.
  Oct 15 is approaching but I'm scared to clean box B cuz I'm worried our
  (male) cat will decide he has no where to go.

  Thoughts?

Poor Roark. He's been getting fatty lumps for about a year now. Nothing large,
mostly small like the size of a BB, a chickpea or maybe 2" across at most. We
had two removed and tested a year ago and they were fine, so the rest we just
note and track. However I noticed a dense lump, like a tennis ball, just under
his ribcage. It wasn't hard like bone, but the location was really concerning.
Vet did an x-ray on Fri, results are indicating he has an enlarged spleen.
*sigh* He goes in for pre-anesthesia blood work in the morning. I have no
experience with organ problems like this. ANyone have some good resources or
guidance about what we might be looking at? Hopefully this isn't a life
shortener for him. His behavior is fine, happy, playful! Eating is completely
normal, weight is tracking perfectly. Just this density.
They are going to do an ultrasound, and then I don't know what else. Just
feeling all anxious for my big doggie...

  Do litter boxes need to be replaced after awhile?

  I can see a possible cause: we had these litter boxes when we had another
  cat (temporarily) so maybe he can still smell her pee (even though I've
  washed them many times since).

  I removed the litter box he was using, leaving only box A and he is using it.

I had originally refrained from posting about my experience with this since,
well, I don't know jack shit about veterinary medicine and our situations could
be miles apart.  But since no one else has commented, I have had some
experience with this.  My first dog--a miniature (larger size) pomeranian--also
had an enlarged spleen.  It wasn't a real big deal at first, but it got worse,
even with meds.  By the time I felt I had to put her down, it spanned the
entire width of her belly.  She was clearly in constant pain and I couldn't
even pick her up without hurting her.  It was one of the worst things ever.

I put her down several years after the diagnosis, at age 14.  She was on
medicine for it, but it didn't seem to help.  Please note that this wasn't her
only issue at the time.. her teeth were also really bad, and one of her legs
still gimped from trauma from a fight with a dog years earlier.  But the spleen
was a big part of it.

I hope this doesn't discourage you too much.  If I could do it all over again
knowing what would happen, I'd have asked my vet if there are any options other
than medicine (ie surgery, etc.)  If there are any questions I can answer that
would be helpful, please let me know.

Unfortunately, I was a kid at the time and really didn't take it as seriously
as I should have.  The vet told me I needed to provide Lily with medicine until
the problem got under control and it never did.. and I never pushed back.  I
just accepted the fact that she would be on medication for the rest of her life

Most animals get their D3 through ingestion. Cholesterol undergoes conversion
to D3 in the skin and fur upon exposure to UV light, which dogs and cats get
through grooming. The pathways involved are straightforward but biochemically
complex. Note that the use of statins to lower serum cholesterol in humans may
have ramifications with respect to vitamin D, particularly in the elderly.

Calciferols (including vitamin D2 and D3) are used as rodenticides; animals
that consume the baits including these may show symptoms of hypervitaminosis D,
which can kill.

Crisis averted! :) Just back from the specialist and the short story is my
doggie is just fine!
Longer story. Went to the specialist. Incredibly well run business. Tech came
out, spoke with me for a few minutes, then took Roark back for his ultrasound.
About 20 min later she came and got me and brought me to an exam room. The vet
came and shared what he saw. Basically he said the spleen was a little
nelarged, but it didn't cross the midline and didn't extended down to the
bladder, so while it was a *little* enlarged, it wasn't enlarged to a point of
being worried about it. He said there were no growth or tumors or masses. He
checked the liver, kidneys, and more and said everything looked normal. He
added that there's cases where the spleen can be enlarged because it is
compensating for red blood cell production or is aggravated and acting as a
lymph node, but he's not seeing other signs of that. Basically he was staring
at a healthy spleen. So he logically backed up and asked what brought us there
for the ultrasound. I explained about palpating and finding the lump, the vet
palpating and the xray. He acknowledged the spleen looked a bit enlarged on the
xray, but not too big. He asked for other symptoms, general or specific. Roark
has no other symptoms. Honestly, he's active and playfun and great energy
level, normal functions, etc. No jaundice or capillary problems or anything. He
said he could run another test aspirating the spleen and sending off the cells
to check but really discouraged bothering with that as 99% chance all is well.
With no other symptoms, I see no reason to go puncturing his spleen right now.
So! My doggie is fine, all is good, and I've dropped another bundle on doggie
health :) That's ok. That's an ok way to spend money for me. Atleast my doggie
is ok :)

So glad to hear it!  Also, you now have a baseline xray so you can watch and
make sure the condition doesn't progress.  It might be worth having another
xray sometime in the next year just to make sure.

I'm pretty sure in Lily's case, the enlarged spleen was due to irritation,
because the medication they gave me was some sort of anti-inflammatory.  It
sounds like your tech wasn't seeing anything like that.

Ok need to start making homemade dog biscuits. This is a recipe I got what do
you guys think.
2 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1/2 c powdered milk
1 tsp brown sugar (optional)
1 tbps wheat germ
cut in 1 tsp beef bouillon (granules)
       6 tbps bacon grease or meat drippings (would beef grease be ok?)
Mix In 1 egg
Add: 1/2 cup ice water
Preheat oven 350
add enough ice water for mixture to form a ball.  Pat out to 1/2 inch thick and
cut back 25-30 mins remove and cool on wire racks.

Last night we brown some hamburger and still have the grease, would that be ok?
I'm not understanding why we need to put more fat into treats, isn't the beef
bouillon good enough?

We are very picky about our dog not eating human food.  Yes I know some of you
disagree.  We have given her raw egg before only because her coat was very dry
and she needed it, so we do human food IF we have to but we don't make it a
pratice.

Ok, this is the recipe I make most often.  Make sure you roll it thinner and
cook until it's lightly browned on top and bottom, otherwise you leave moisture
in the treats and then they get moldy if they are not refrigerated.  Cook them
long enough until they are dry in the middle and they can stay on your counter.
I make mine about 1/8" thick but you can make them as thick as 1/2".  They can
be cut with a cookie cutter, or you can just use a pizza cutter to make smaller
snack size pieces.

Preheat to 350F

For topping (optional)
1 egg, beaten with one pinch of salt (salt is optional)
1 TBSP sesame seeds

Batter:
2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour, extra to use when rolling out to prevent sticking
3/4 cup wheat bran (oat bran works fine)
1/4 cup peanut butter (any kind, natural or stabilized is fine)
      ^ but I've always used natural.  Other nut butters work too.
1/4 cup milk
1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce
2 eggs

Note: you can double the peanut butter, add a little bit more milk if needed
to mix it well with the other stuff, and it can make it a bit more sticky so
you can add a bit more flour as needed.

Beat the first egg with salt and set aside

Mix flour and bran together in a large bowl.  In a food processor (or beat by
hand or use a mixer) mix the peanut butter and milk until the peanut butter is
liquified.  add the applesauce and two eggs and mix well.  Add liquid to dry
and stir into stiff dough.  Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface.  Roll
to no more than 1/2" thick.  Use cookie cutters or pizza cutter to cut into
shapes.  Place biscuits on a baking sheet.  Brush each with beaten egg and
sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Bake for 25-30 min or until tops and bottoms are
browned.  Store at room temp in a loosely covered container.

I rarely do the egg and sesame because I make a double batch and I cut them
into 1" pieces, and it's just added work that my dog doesn't care about.   When
I make them for others I roll them thicker and use cookie cutters, these can be
dipped in things like peanut butter melts or vanilla melts or carob melts to
give you fancier treats if you want to gift them to someone.

My daughter wants a bird, badly. She has for over a year. Specifically, she
wants a green-cheeked conure, or similar type of parrot.

Problem is, we have 3 dogs and 3 cats already. I fear a bird would be killed.

Also, birds require attention, from what I understand. We are busy people and
some days it may only get an hour or two of human interaction. I fear it would
go crazy.

Also, I hate birds. Despise them. I don't want one. But my wife already gave
the semi-okay to her, if she saved enough money. She has $400. Shit.

Any thoughts on birds, and how to determine if you are the right home for one?

My daughter is incredibly smart and responsible, and she knows a ton about
birds by now. I just think it's a bad idea.

One of my friends recently had to rehome her family's parrot. It wasn't hers.
It belonged to her parents. They didn't want it anymore. They'd had it for
something like 30 years. At least. She didn't particularly like the bird, but
somehow it wound up being her responsibility to rehome it while her parents
were visiting her sister.

Parrots live a REALLY long time if you look after them well. If she's dead-set
on birds, I'd go for something small like finches or canaries. I'm pretty sure
they don't live as long as parrots, and they're still cute and fun to watch.

Well, the decision has been made... Oy...

Yesterday was her birthday, and she fell in love with a bird at the pet store
and bought it. It's a mix between a sun conure and a green cheeked conure.
Should like 20-25 years. It's a baby, so we can't pick it up for 6-8 weeks.

We got home and my wife looked up more info about this mix of bird, and
apparently it's a prtty rare cross-species hybrid. And they sometimes have
health problems. Great.

Going back to the pet store today to ask them about that and learn more. It
would be just fab for a $300 bird to die 4 months later!

Socialization at an early age is critical for any parrot. If not socialized,
one can end up with an animal that communicates primarily by biting.

Conures are the exception. They communicate primarily by screaming. Relatives
who owned a sun conure got rid of it shortly after they realized its primary
charm concerned lots of screaming, first thing every morning.

My Aunt & Uncle had some parrots.  I was always scared they were going to bite.
I found them to be very annoying.  For all I know they might still have them in
the cellar. I never go downstairs to see if they are down there.

I doubt it got the proper socialization it needed and I bet my Uncle just

Finches are the guppies of the bird world. Properly done, one can hatch out
just enough finches to replace losses (they live 4-5-6 years or so), and
finches aren't much for socializing with humans so they don't mind neglect. IN
a home with pets, a cage can be hung from the ceiling where it's more difficult
for them to be harassed. Zebra finches are about as straightforward as a pet
can get.

Parrots, OTOH- I know one guy who had his macaw get sick, and they ended up
getting a CT scan. So- veterinary CT scan (about $2500), board-certified
veterinary anesthesiologist, board-certified veterinary neurologist, and an
exotics vet- I don't even remember how many zeroes were on the end of the final
tallying of expenses.

Cat Pee

  Our ~11 yr old cat is peeing in the dinner room (one of the few places
  with carpet, yeah, what idiot says "let's put carpet in the living room?"
  i want to smack the previous owners). What things should I check, and in
  what order?

Visit the vet
  - he's due, so I'll probably go anyways.
Litter
  - cleaned/shifted
  - changed one of the boxes (he has 2) with fresh litter
  - I even cleaned the litter box itself, took it outside, washed it down.
  - Should I buy him a new box? These are pushing 5+ years (though they seem
    fine to me. they could have a smell of a cat that lived with us for a
    short time, ~5 years ago).
Food
  - i did just give him Core Wellness. he loves it, but I suppose it could be
    related?
Cleaned the spots
  - I used a lot of Pet remover stain spray and the rest of the "Just for cats"
    stuff we had. Still smells quite bad.
  - I'm gonna get out the carpet cleaner and shampoo the mofo!
Other Cats
  - he has been MAD at the other cats in the neighborhood, coming to our house
    and teasing him. he will attack the window for one dark kitty that I
    don't know. He'll make less mad noises when the cat I do know (Tiger)
    comes over.
    Not sure what i'd do here...
Indoor
  - we keep him indoors all the time because he goes out and immediately starts
    eating grass, and soon after, pukes it up. Wonder if he's mad at us for
    not letting him out?
    Wonder what's worse? pee or puke? probably pee.
Other?

Cats> I'll take puke over pee any day. And I live with a world-class puker.
He's had his pee problems (some related to UTI, some as a protest when I fail
at litter box cleaning). Solution: vinegar and baking soda. Douse the spot in
vinegar, let it dry. Then, sprinkle with baking soda. I don't vacuum it up for
a while, letting the baking soda have plenty of time to absorb odor; this has
worked wonders for us!

As to causes: UTI is always my first thought. Make sure all boxes are clean, as
it could be a protest. It could also be in protest to the other cats coming
around: he's mad, and he's going to prove it, dammit! Otherwise, I don't know.

  I'll try the vinegar/baking soda.
  Should I try to (obviously) clean up the pee before applying the vinegar?
  *Adds to shopping list: BIG BOX of baking soda*

  Litter boxes are clean. When I shifted them last, there was one clump of
  pee. So he's peeing a lot in the dinning room (god forbid some other place
  we haven't found yet). I get the impression he doesn't like using his
  litter box (hence the idea of buying a new one). I know he doesn't like
  using his litter box when the laundry is going (his litter box is in the
  same small room). But it has been that way for 4+ years in this house
  and 2.5 years in the previous house so....

  UTI seems somewhat likely.

  Other cats: Put his pee soaked paper towel outside to try to drive off the
  other cats? heh.

One way to check for UTI (and it's not exactly scientific...) is to carry him
to the litter box. If he spreads all fours to prevent entry, there's a good
chance it's a UTI. Cats associate pain with the box and won't go in it.

It's possible his pee could scare them off...despite living in an apartment
building, we haven't had a problem with other cats.

I just sprinkle on the baking soda and let it sit for a while. Might be a day,

literally left it and it sort of absorbed into the carpet.

With the vinegar, just pour it on and let it soak in. I doeesn't hurt to follow
up with baking soda over top when the vinegar is soaked in and dry.

Ferret question>

We have 2 ferrets that share a cage. They get many hours (10+) out of their
cage most days, but when I put them back in, every time, for a few minutes they
bite and pull at their cage, which is a wired cage. After a couple minutes they
give up and go to bed. Except today, the male pulled one of the welds off the
cage and got out. If we hadn't seen him escaping it could have been really bad,
for example we were supposed to be gone all weekend but weather canceled our
plans, and while their sections of the house are ferret proofed, not all are.
Also, we normally have a dog (who was boarded because of our foiled weekend
plans) who would want to play and likely hurt them. So, we fixed the weld but
would like to prevent another incident in training them not to bit/pull at the
cage wire at all. Any ideas? Would spraying bitter apple or something on the
cage when they bite at it (not at the ferrets faces or anything) help? Any
other ideas? They understand the word "no" pretty well, but not when it applies
to them being in their cage. I really don't want to lose one to cage escape :(
It's not a cheapo cage or anything, so I'm a bit surprised he managed to pull
it off, unless it was just a weak weld or something.

Miser, is your dog intact?  How old is he?  And invest in some cheap baby wipes
(like the bulk Costco brand).  Use one to wipe off his peed on legs when you
come in, it takes care of most of the odor and the dog won't get sick if he
licks his leg after you use the wipe on it.

On the carpet cleaning, our dog has been peeing and pooping in our entryway.
Overall, he is just being a butt. He goes outside for us without any problems,
he just refuses to hold it while we are at work. I know he can because he does
it at night.
Anyhow, we were not having any luck with it. One section was brown (from white)
where he kept peeing. Poop spots all over the floor. Needless to say we were
embarrassed to have anyone see it. On a lark, we tried hot water and oxyclean.
HOLY CRAP! These old stains came up. we also have a Bissell shampooer that did
not seem to work that well until we got the deep clean attachment to go with
the bush. Put that think on, and it has these rubber nubs that get in deep, and
squirt the solution into the base of the carpet. That worked well. I used
shampoo for that, but next time I will do just oxyclean in the machine.

TAP, at this point an enzymatic cleaner is going to be useless since you
already used the vinegar and baking soda.  It needs to be on the spots beforre
you try something else.  Next time, when there's a pee spot, soak the area with
enzyme cleaner and put some plastic wrap or foil over it to keep it damp.

Cragmor, take your dog back to puppyhood in terms of housetraining.  Dogs and
cats don't start pooping and peeing just to get at their owner or for revenge
or anything like that.  Get a crate and keep him in the crate, taking him out
at lunchtime (or get a petsitter to take him out).  Let him have freedom when
you're home, but crate him when you can't watch him.  Generally it only takes a
couple of weeks of remedial housetraining to get a dog back on track as long as
there aren't other issues.  How old is your dog?  He could be having anxiety,
which is not allowing him to hold onto things, and there could be other reasons
that he's going during the day.  How much exercise does he get on a daily
basis?

  The room stil stinks.
  The vinegar has since dried.
  The baking soda is still there after 2 days.
  I'm hoping the stink is the vaccum cleaner or a different part of the carpet
  I didn't treat. I only treated the area in front of the windows and one
  wall where I saw the cat pee.

  I still need a suggestion for an enzymatic cleaner for when this happens

I'm probably being just an overly paranoid doggy mommy, but figured I'd ask
here anyways. Roark has a bit of a cough. It's not kennel cough and is not
frequent. It's just that it sounds odd that has me concerned.
We first noticed it a few nights ago. He was laying on the couch and then did
this very throaty, phlegmy kind of cough. Straightened his body to really expel
whatever was bothering him, and then seemed to swallow and lick his lips. He
did it a coule of times that evening, but not again during the night and didn't
do it the next day a single time. However the next evening he did it a couple
of times. Yesterday he did it once during the day, and today he's done it twice
during the day. That all sounds so very specific. :/
It makes me think of lungworm in horses as that starts int he lungs, gets
coughed up and then swallowed into the digestive tract.
No signs of parasites, he's behaving perfectly normally, eating regularly, etc.
Just this bit of a cough every so often.
Maybe I'm ultra paranoid with the parvo stuff going around out here. They are
all up to date on all their shots for everything, including lepto.
Any thoughts about what it is or what we should watch for?

My dilemna is it time to look for a new vet?  I've used this vet for 3 years as
it's inside my place of employment and convenient. Until this time never had a
real issue other than by breeder contract one of my dogs needs vaccinations
spaced out and the vet always wants to just do them all and pretend they were
spaced out.
This time: my 11 year old chihuahua mix started to cough, he had a known heart
murmur. Within a few days I realized the cough was heart related and he had
fluid on his lungs. Took him. He was in heart failure. Vet opted to inject
Lasix(sp) but couldn't get a vein to stay open so gave in IM. Within 20 minutes
of injection he had a seizure (or maybe a stroke). He was paralyzed in the rear
legs after that seizure. Vet and her partner both said to give the med time and
allow him the option to fight. Gave another injection a few hours later, paired
with a bunch of blood work. By the end of my work day he was stable but not
great. Took him home with 3 prescriptions. Furesomide, benzapril and
pimobendan. I got one week worth because I wasn't certain he was going to make
it the night. He remained paralyzed for that week, and I thought perhaps had at
least one more seizure (I videoed it but the vet said she wasn't sure it was a
true seizure). Refilled the prescription and noticed the pills were different
in one bottle. Asked the vet tech. After opening bottles and showing me meds
determined the first week I was given the wrong dosage of pill (it was half the
dose it was suppose to be). after one pill in the evening, the next day my dog
regained use of his rear legs. By the next day he was back to trying to get on
furniture and playing with our other dogs. Re
refilled the prescription a third time (not at the vet clinic but a real
pharmacy because it was 1/3 of the price). Picked the medicine up and noticed
the directions now stated to give a full pill when we had been giving a half
pill. Asked the pharmacy who said that's what was written. Asked the vet the
next morning and her only response was my handwriting is not that bad.
So now I'm wondering if 3 prescription errors is so out of the norm I should
switch vets. I pointed out the mistake to the manager of the vet clinic, the
vet and to her partner. They all said , Wow we are sorry.

MoonToad> It is a banfield clinic. I realize some of the issues people have
with them is not really the vet but issues with how the corporation is run and
what they can and can't do. Working for a corporation means you lose a lot of
your ability to make decisions yourself and are bound to uphold what the
company believes in. I just get a bad feeling in my stomach replaying the
situation. I'm not a complainer and I always want to believe malice wasn't an
issue. The fact he remained paralyzed for a week in the leg the injection was
given also make me wonder if everything was just coincidence. I have another
vet who left Banfield because she wanted to be able to treat animals the way
she wanted and not the way she was told it must happen. So perhaps I can give
her a chance. I've also had my eye on a vet in town who practices alternative
medicine (like acpuncture and chiropractic care, with herbal remedies etc) that
I'd like to get to know.

I'd love to have access to a holistic vet.  There's one in town and he used to
be good, but now he's old, his clinic smells like cat piss and everyone has a
complaint about his care of their animals.

I also think that Banfield is more than willing to hire vets that are less
competant that have been blacklisted from the local clinics for poor care. 
When they got a new CEO in something like 09 the care at the clinics changed
from being led by the vet care to being led by money, and they try to make sure
that every person is charged a minimum amount per visit.  They took away
partnerships with the vets and make them work more hours than they can
handle.  They are so much more expensive than a regular vet, because of
pressuring people to  buy services and medications that aren't always necessary
..  The only thing that I think they are good for are possibly the vaccination
clinics they have once a month or whatever, with low-cost vaccines that people
can use that they otherwise wouldn't do.

Oh, there are also tons of complaints about Banfield from all over the country
at places like consumeraffairs.com and pissedconsumer.com even ripoffreport.com
has over a hundred reports on them.

Banfield has an average cost they have to charge for each client, which is why
you're made to do so many tests and given medications that are not necessary or
are really excessively priced.  All vets have overhead, and that's why getting
medication from the vet costs more than getting it from a human pharmacy, but
there's reasonable overhead and outrageously overpriced which is what Banfield
is.

So I have had to separate the brothers yet again. As a reminder, these are
guinea pigs. The brothers are Squeak and Bubble, and they are 2 1/2yo Peruvian
males. I also have a 2yo teddy male named Batman. Bubble and Squeak have lived
together all their lives and are separated from Batman by a divider in my
huge-ass cage (cubes & coroplast, 3x5). I use fleece & towels as bedding.

Squeak is the dominant pig and prefers Bubble to stay put in or on one of the
two hideys/beds I keep in the cage (they chage out weekly when I clean cages).
If Bubble moves off his spot and Squeak wants him to get back there, he chases
Bubble around the cage. Once Bubble is in place, Squeak usually mounts him
sideways.

Apparently they've been fighting when I was asleep or out of the house, because
yesterday when I weighed everyone I found two scabbed-over bite marks on
Bubble's back, and today when I cleaned cages I found that his left ear was
torn (it almost matches his right) and one of the toes on his left front foot
is apparently broken and his foot is all swollen. I would have definitely heard
them fighting if I'd been awake/home, because fighting guinea pigs are noisy
buggers.

So I've added a divider to their 3x3 section and Bubble seems very content.
Squeak is a bit lonely, but he's got Bubble on one side and Batman on the
other, so hopefully he'll be okay. Squeak, of course, is fine and has no
injuries whatsoever. Little brat.

Keeping an eye on Bubble's food and water intake and I'll be weighing him daily
until his foot is healed. I called the vet and have approval to give Metacam
(painkiller) and ChlorPalm (antibiotic) for the next little while. I have both
on hand, left over from Sandy (the rescue guinea pig who died in September
after a long illness).

My vet only is recommending Trifexis as a replacement. I have heard less than
stellar things about Heartguard, but I don't know the details. Trifexis seems
stronger, it seems to have more side effects, and it has broader impact on the
parasites which isn't necessary for those who treat consistently. And the pill
is MUCH bigger and a bit harder to give. The doggies tend to crunch it instead
of swallowing it. My vet recommends Trifexis as the replacement, but it is very
reluctantly. He far prefers Sentinel.
Sounds like we just need to keep checking the F&S website. Hadn't realized vets
were noticing F&S somehow got batches and it wasn't explained. I'll just keep
checking back with them :/

He's probably recommending the Trifexis because it has the same heartworm
ingredient as Sentinel (milbemycin oxime) and it also controls fleas without
having to use a topical (with spinosad) like Sentinel does.  It's the closet
thing on the market to Sentinel.

The less than stellar thing about Heartgard is that it's been used so long
heartworms are becoming resistant and it doesn't always kill them.  It also is
happening in humans, they give ivermectin to prevent River Blindness and after
being used for at least 30 years the bugs are becoming resistant.  They are
switching humans over to moxidectin, a close relative of ivermectin but the
bugs respond to it.  Incidentally, that's what is in Advantage Multi, plus the
imidacloprid for flea control.  (and by bugs i mean the worms, as in little
buggers)

I noticed that F&S was getting batches of interceptor when I was getting it for
my dog.  I got 6 months worth but wasn't allowed more because of the expiration
date of the drugs.  Then I looked to get more when I got my puppy, and they
were out.  I wasn't too worried, as I had enough from that 6 month pack to last
a couple months for the puppy when it got to that weight, I'd use 4 during that
time for my adult.  When the puppy was at the right weight I went to the site
again and they had stock available, with a different expiration date, and I was
able to get 12 of them.  I will have to buy more in probably three or four
months when my dog sizes out of the pills (he'll probably be 10 pounds over)
but I have enough this way for my other dog.  So, it was just by getting the
stuff with different expiration dates and checking on my own I realized they
were getting stocks of the drugs from somewhere.

TAP, if your cat is peeing there's a reason for it.  Where does he normally pee
and why?  I presume you've had a vet check him out.  I had a cat that peed
everywhere from what was then called interstitial cystitis, and I did have to
put that cat down even though she was otherwise healthy.  Her bladder walls
were a quarter inch thick and she was in pain when she peed.  It broke my heart
but there was no more treatment for her and I couldn't bear to keep her in pain
and watch as she peed dark bloody urine (the blood was from the inflammation of
her bladder).

Anyway, if you're ruled out health problems, you need to figure out why the
peeing is happening.  Cats tend to pee from anxiety, if it's not from a
physical problem or from a dirty litter box.  If the cat had at one time a UTI
and had pain when he peed, he could be associating the litterbox with the pain.
If so, buy a new litter box and put it in a new place and that should help.  If
it's from anxiety, there are things you can do.  Get Feliway, the stuff that
plugs into your socket like a glade plug-in, and put that in the rooms the cat
spends the most time in.  Try and see what is causing anxiety, was there a
change in routine or a move to a new home or something like that?  Prozac can
help too, when my cat was on it it was the best anti-depressant for helping
with cat anxiety.  It's also really cheap for cats, the formula you spread in
the ears was maybe at most 30 bucks a month and I think it's cheaper now.

Treat those pee spots heavily with an enzymatic solution.  I think that
Petastic is better than Nature's Miracle but it's harder to find.  Really
saturate the area so you can get down into the padding under the carpet and
keep it wet for a full 24 hours (soaking it and putting foil or plastic over
it) and I would then suggest you get your carpet professionally cleaned if you
can afford it.

(if you've, not you're up there).

Thanks to the vet, we have her on anxiety medication and she hasn't peed

And yeah, I meant the carpet cleaning once you've identified the issue and have
the other things put in place.  Because sometimes even with the issues
identified and mostly fixed the odor can still make some cats go back and use
the spots, so a deep clean can help get rid of the residual behavior.  In the
meantime, you can cover favorite spots to pee with foil when you're at this
point, to break the habit of peeing there.  Or you can cover some cardboard
with double sided tape that is just tacky enough to annoy the cat from going to
that spot, not super strong stuff that will keep him stuck there and put that
on the spots.

None of his bite wounds have gotten infected, so I'm stopping the antibiotics

YOu definitely want to discourage the outside cats.  Get carpet runners that
have the sharp points underneath and put them where the cats stand outside,
upside down, so they have to step on the points.  They also sell mats
specifically for this purpose (to keep cats off whatever surface you want). 
You can also wrap some cardboard in double sided tape that is just tacky, not
glue-trap levels of stick.  If it's warm where you are now, plant rue, or plant
it in the spring.  Use a Scare Crow attached to the hose to nail the cat with
water when it comes by.  There's something that is called "CatStop" that uses
ultrasonic noise to startle the cats, but it can be painful for animals to
hear, it affects all wildlife, and your own cats can hear it so unless you want
all animals to be hurt by that noise, I wouldn't bother.

I could use some advice on how to get a dog and cat to tolerate each other. I
didn't properly introduce them when the dog was a puppy. And now he's 6 and
still chases after her and gets quite vocal about it. And because of him, the
cat won't ever come out of hiding. I never worried much about it before because
even before I got the dog, she didn't care about being social and has only ever
liked one other living creature, and that was one of my other cats that passed
away in December. So in the past, with the dog there or not, she still didn't
come out of hiding much.

I also lost another cat in Aug., so now she's the only cat. I was wondering if
she might start to come out of her shell a bit, and surprisingly she has. So
now that she's the only cat and never wants to be around the dog, I'm afraid
she's becoming a bit lonely and I don't know how to get the dog to just chill
out around her. Or for her to just tolerate him. I know he won't do anything.
He doesn't mess with cats that aren't afraid of him. But when they are afraid,
well then it's a fun game of growl and chase.

I've tried to get him to stay calm while I hold that cat. But it never lasts
long. She usually freaks out and takes off, and them the dog goes after.
I've tried putting them both in a separate crate next to each other. But then
there's hissing and growling. And I'm afraid it just gets the cat more freaked
out and the dog more worked up.

So I'm stuck and can't think of what to try next.
Any suggestions?
Thanks!

I think you were onto something with the crate idea.  Have you tried leaving
the dog crated for a longer period of time and leaving the cat out of her
crate?  This gives the cat more control and the ability to approach the dog on
her own terms.

You may want to avoid holding the cat around him or allowing the dog to corner
her, as this could work counter to your goal.

Yeah, forcing them to be crated next to each other isn't going to do much. 
Keeping the dog crated while you spend time with the cat is a good idea.  You
need to start training your dog to leave the cat alone.  Clicker training can
help but it's not absolutely necessary.  Get a bunch of treats, something small
and soft that can be eaten quickly.  If you're using the clicker, train the
clicker first.  Then train your dog to do what you want it to do when the cat
walks or runs by.  If you want it to sit, train it to sit/stay.  If you want it
to lie down, train it to down/stay.  Keep doing that until you have an instant
sit or down and you have a strong reliable stay.  Work on it until your dog
continues sitting or lying even when you've left the room and even if you shut
a door between you and the dog.

Then train a rock solid recall.  Make sure the dog comes instantly every single
time.  While you're at it, do some outdoor recall training too!  Never know
when it will save your dog's life.

So, now you have a solid sit or down/stay, and a solid recall.  You can now
start letting the dog be uncrated in the cat's presence.  Put the dog in the
sit or down, encourage the cat to walk by.  Work on keeping the dog in position
until the cat walks away.  If at any time the cat runs off and the dog bolts
after it,  this is where the recall comes in handy.  Teaching both a sit and
down stay might be best, too.  That way if the cat is comfortable enough to lie
down next to you on the couch for a snooze, you can put the dog into a
down/stay and the dog will hopefully fall asleep too.

Continue the desensitization of the dog.  Control the dog when the cat is
around (sit/down and recall),  keep them physically apart when you can't watch
them.  Crate the dog when the cat is free, crate the cat (or put it in another
room) when the dog is free.  If the dog pesters the crated cat just crate the
cat in another room.  Eventually this behavior becomes the normal behavior for
the dog, and he'll  stop chasing the cat.  You may have to remind him when the
cat walks in to hang out, but then he'll go and sit or down on his own and
he'll just hang out like he normally would (make sre he has a variety of toys
and chews around).

If something that is otherwise topical is hideously racially offensive, it
should be nuked from orbit.

And no, I won't just let it go.  Plenty of whites wish many of us blacks would
just let it go.  They get a little cranky when their opportunities to be

Yes.

That's why the KKK gets to have parades.


Your first mistake really is thinking someone else speaking generally is you
being harrassed... and your second is then thinking you have some "right" to
not hear anything you might find offensive.


You know the old saw, I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to
the death your right to say it?  there's a reason for the saying.

Repression of speach ought always be a last resort.  A post that was topic, and
didn't actually cause a disruption, doesn't rise to the level it ought be
deleted.... even if someone decided to take offense at it.

Just because an offensive post stands for three does doesn't mean that the

If the only way to show that a racist post generates disruptive non-topic pots
posts in response, is to... create disruptive non-topic posts in response, then
so be it.

The policy that lets blatantly racist posts stand represents the thoughts of
the people that craft and implement that policy. Particularly when, as we've
been told, acting or not acting on the policy is discretionary.
killbabyseals.com may have a policy saying all posts are welcome, but if they
keep posts in favor of killing baby seals and delete all posts against baby
seals, how they act on the policy certainly tells us something about them.

Day of 11/28: Knightshade inquires, Bleeding Me responds
11/29 - 12/12: ????
12/13:  Knightshade inquires again, no response
12/14 - 01/09: ????
01/10: Knightshade inquires for third time
01/11 - 01/13: ????
01/14: Lighning responds, sysop handling review is away.


Probably would have been a nice idea to inform Knightshade when the Sysop
discussion started, when it ended, when it was decided which Sysop would be
handling the review, and when that Sysop became unavailable.

Just to update everyone, appeal was denied. And I was told, well, here it is:


As a group, the sysops
find ourselves spending more time reviewing your deletions and/or warnings
than is reasonable, given the size and make up of the client base on
ISCABBS.  This leads us, as a group, close to a "looks ike, smells like"
situation with you, as a user.  One person with so many appeals leads us
to wonder whether it is us, the whole cadre of forum moderators, or ...
you.  Logic dictates that there is no vast conspiracy of sysops and forum
moderators against Knightshade.  Yet here we are, again, reviewing an
appeal of a deletion and warning from you







For the record, I scrolled back in my Mail.... in the last full year I find a
total of _two_ requests for review I sent to the sysops... this being the
second one.



Apparently that qualifies as an unreasonable workload, clearly suggesting the
user is the issue.

Oh, and for anyone curious-

I was deleted for violating the spoiler rule in television.  Which I didn't do.


Post in quesiton-


Nov 14, 2012 08:49 from Knightshade
NOTE this is speculation not presented as fact-

It's Lori on the phone... I speculate this based on a storyline in the comics,
and while that storyline doesn't happen in the prison, Rick does get a phone
call from her "ghost" (it's all in his head as he's gone kinda nuts)

I speculate they simply are cut-n-pasting the comic idea into the current tv
show situation, since Loris death itself was also changed significantly from
the comic.
[Television> msg #135784 (2 remaining)] Read cmd ->





Per the FI, I clearly labeled my post up top as speculation... and as it turned
out when the next episode aired, THE INFO I POSTED WAS NOT WHAT ACTUALLY
HAPPENED.



So something that wasn't, at all, a spoiler, and was posted as per the FI as
explicitly speculation, was deleted as a spoiler and the sysops upheld it.






Oh, and here's the FI part that I followed To. The. Letter.


A spoiler is any advance information, or discussion of such advance
        information, before the show is broadcast nationally in the U.S.
        Central time zone, regarding plotlines and/or the show's outcome
        which could ruin the enjoyment of the show.  This does not include
        speculation or discussion about future episodes, as long as the post is
        presented as speculation/discussion and not as fact.





But hey, apparently it's all me that's the issue.

When your case is specifically spelled out in the FI as an exemption, I don't
see that as a judgement call at all.

Add to that the sysop reply (which is truly bullshit, if what KS says is true

Also, it did end up that the call was from Lori, and that it wasn't really
happening, and that it was all in Rick's head. So I'm not sure what you're

There could have been a number of reasons why the review took so long.  I don't
know for sure, but it's possible that some Ops chose not to review because they
didn't feel they could be impartial.  It could also be that the deletion
occurred right in the middle of the holidays, and since there was no KO, it
wasn't a priority.

I do know this though - there comes a point when a user makes a game of toeing
the line of the rules, and consistantly breaks the spirit of the rules so many
times that their deletion review requests become less important.  Sorry, but if
you're posting in a manner that causes you to be deleted that often, your
requests cease to become a priority.  The priority on this review - and the
deletion itself - fits perfectly in line with the "common sense policy," a
policy that Knightshade himself likes to take credit for.

I agree with what Cooper Lethe stated.  If someone is always doing such acts
like this of course they are not going to make this a priority anymore. With
that said when I yelled it took them a few weeks to decide to even answer me.
Which I found unacceptable.  They are breaking their own rules by saying they
will answer within 24hours yet they never do.
Mine wasn't the end of the world, but it would have been nice to deal with th
matter while it was still something to handle until waiting until it isn't an
issue anymore because nobody gives a shit.

So with that I have concluded that nobody gives a shit so neither should I :)

To be clear, no that was NOT Lori on the phone.


Lori got on the phone after 3 OTHER people did, in a LATER episode.


Rick was speaking to everyone in the group who had died.  The person who he
spoke to in the episode that was the cliffhanger, the voice I was SPECULATING
about... Was. Not. Lori.


My speculation was wrong.  It was not, at all, a spoiler.



What did, and I DID speculate THIS... was they took the general idea, and they
CHANGED IT.


Instead of his just getting a call from his dead wife, he got a call from
someone else who died.  Then he spoke to OTHERS who died in subsequent calls
(AFTER my speculation) and then FINALLY, at the end of the thread, Lori got on
the phone with him.





So no, the story borrowed some stuff from the comic (as do a lot of things in
the show) but DID not simply follow the exact comic.


It was speculation, informed by the original source material, but not, at all,
a spoiler.


It was -explicitly- what the FI says is allowed.  The FM got it wrong, the
sysops got it wrong in triplicate, since they got the review wrong, they got
hte fact I "yell too much" when I've appealed twice in a YEAR... and they got
it wrong taking 2 months to do all of the above.



Just so we're clear :)

Sorry for the triple, but it occured to me that while my _speculation_ was
wrong, that sorta misses the point.


Because sometimes speculation, which is at best a slightly informed guess,
might be right.

and it's still not a spoiler.



So while the fact my speculation wasn't even correct certrainly reinforced the
fact it was NOT a spoiler, even if it had been right it still wouldn't have
been, because I had no advance knowledge of the actual TV show, I hadn't seen
the episode before hand, or seen an interview with a writer or something. I was
guessing.

I guessed wrong, but right or wrong wouldn't have changed the fact it WAS a
guess.  Speculation, not spolier.

And explicitly not deletable by the FI.

In reality, it was Amy, not Lori.


He spoke to Lori later, after speaking to several OTHER dead people.



All this happens over 2 episodes, the one that had already aired and then the
next one.



In the comic he speaks to Lori repeatedly over many locations and time, shares
his "secret" of talking to dead people with Michonne, carries an unplugged
phone around with him for a long time to keep talking to her, and in general
the story is quite different. (and he nevr speaks to any other dead people)



So yeah, not only is it different, it's different in a way that makes my
speculation (that they were doing the comic story, but starting at the prison
instead of a phone booth) wrong.  The story we got was shorter, included
numerous other characters, excluded the Michonne plot, resolved differently,
etc.



I speculated based on the comic, and they ended up doing something only vaguely
similar.



All of which ignores the fact that a guess is still a guess, regardless of if
it turns out right or not.

Knightshade running to the Sysops every time he's deleted is childish
in the modern era of ISCABBS.  Just get over it.  Someone thought you
should be deleted, you think you don't.  They happen to be the FM so
the post disappears.  When the BBS had layers of bureaucracy and

"To be clear, no that was NOT Lori on the phone."

You said it was Lori on the phone, and it was all in Rick's head.  And in fact,
it was Lori on the phone, and it was all in Rick's head.  It was also other
people.  What you stated was correct, if not complete.  You said enough to
spoil the suspense of the cliffhanger.  That's what a spoiler is.

And to be clear, even if you were 100% wrong, I still would have deleted the
post.  Posting what happens in the source material is not speculation, by any
sane definition of "speculation."

"he based it on an educated guess based on source material that was
NOT by most definitions a spoiler. "

By the FM's definition of a spoiler, stating what happens in the source
material, and calling it "speculation" is most definitely a spoiler.

"the information on the source material had largely been available for quite
some time from the comics and most people wouldn't consider a revelation of
something that's already been in publication to really be a spoiler at that
point in the game."

It doesn't matter that the story is already in publication.  Lots of TV shows
and movies are based on other works, but revealing what happens is still a
spoiler.   If I had to guess, I'd say that most Walking Dead viewers (like
myself) haven't read the graphic novels, and have no idea what happens in them,
and don't want to know, because they're enjoying the television show.


"Not that this excuses Adonis's response.  I'm sure they are tired of

They aren't getting out of the review business.
Knightshade abuses the process, and Adonis is flat out telling him that he
abuses the process.  I see nothing wrong with that.

The fact that it was Copper Lethe that deleted Knightshade's post kind of
explains a lot. They have some serious man-wood for each other and tend to
antagonize each other all over the BBS.

Knightshade, it seems, was toeing the line pretty close (probably to get CL's
goat) and CL fell into the trap. Screaming innocence and persecution at this
point is a little thin.

On the other hand, it probably was technically ok... so CL should have just let
it go and not fallen for the bait.

Then we have the Sysops... who took two months to tell KS that he's a problem
child and they're going to decide all of his future (and present) yells based
not on the merits of the case, but on their perception of how he's a pain in
the ass.

If (and I'm assuming this is accurate) Knightshade has really only appealed TWO
(including this one) deletions in the past year... that's hardly causing undue
stress on the busy lives of the sysops.

Taking two months to respond isn't really excusable... neither is the response
itself IF KS is correct that he's appealed twice in the last year.

Not that it matters since ISCA is damn near irrelevant at this point.

No, I shouldn't have let it go, and I have no reason that Knightshade posted
what he posted to specifically get to me.  I strongly stand by my deletion, and
would have done the same regardless of who posted it.

I take issue with your suggestion that I deleted Knightshade's post because it
was made by him.  While, sure, it's the sort of line toeing that Knightshade
does on a regular basis, I would have deleted anyone who had made the same
post.  The FI pretty clearly states:

"A spoiler is any advance information, or discussion of such advance
information, before the show is broadcast nationally in the U.S. Central time
zone, regarding plotlines and/or the show's outcome which could ruin the
enjoyment of the show."

So, no, it wasn't "technically ok," and I wasn't about to let it go.  That's
exactly what Knightshade did.  Regardless of who posted, I would have deleted.
I consider myself a fair FM, and would not delete or sanction a user for
anything other than the content of their post.



And yes, the Sysops took two months to complete the review.  Perhaps
Knightshade only requested two reviews last year (according to him).  That
doesn't change a history of abusing the process.  The review was also requested
a week before the holiday season started, and at this point, we're all adults
with lives, many with kids, jobs, and very real responsibilities that are more
important than yet another Knightshade review.

You said it was Lori on the phone, and it was all in Rick's head.  And in fact,

Except, it wasn't.  It was Amy.  A DIFFERENT dead person.


The next person on the phone in the next episode wasn't Lori either.

It was also a DIFFERENT dead person.


And the next person on the phone in the next episode wasn't Lori either.

It was a THIRD dead person who wasn't Lori.


This is significantly different from both the speculation I made and the
storyline from the comics.


The fact that Lori eventually got on the phone with him LATER doesn't make my
speculation that the person who called him PREVIOUSLY was Lori any less wrong,
or any less SPECULATION rather than a spoiler.

It was entirely on topic, explicitly allowed by the FI, and both CL and the

But it _was_ presented as speculation.


The storyline in the original work happened at a different time, a different

My speculation was that they would take THAT storyline and cut and paste it
into their CURRENT situation, despite a number of other things already being
DIFFERENT between the comic and show.


That's the very _definition_ of speculation.


You can especially tell it was speculaiton since they CHANGED the story from
what I speculated it would be.


Certain elements got kept, many did not, and again location, context, and
characters involved changed significantly.



It wasn't a spoiler by the definition of spoiler in your own FI.

I can fully believe that Knightshade's two deletion reviews in the
past year form the majority of the Sysop's review workload, since
everyone else has probably stopped with the "mommy, mommy, he deleted
me, look in the rules mommy, he can't do that mommy, mommy MOMMY MOMMY
MOMMY MOMMY MOMMY!" a long time ago.  The FM's decision is final.

Can the Sysops say how many total deletion reviews they've done in the
past few years?

Taking two months to tell Knightshade he sucks is still far too long.
I don't blame them for not wanting to talk with him -- who would? --
but being a week before the holidays doesn't magically make it turn
into two months.  It's an excuse for a few weeks while the holidays

If, during a discussion about what might happen in the movie version of the
Hobbit amongst people that hadn't read the book, yes I think that could be
taken as a spoiler. Essentially what happened was, a discussion was going on
about who could be on the phone. KS piped in with "I think it's this, because
that's what happened when the phone rang in original source material"

It's largely a semantic argument at this point, but as a person who was
watching the show who hasn't read the comic, I'd rather not know what
happens in the comic, because the show has shown repeatedly that they
take things that happen in the comic and repurpose it for use in the show.

First of all, we're discussion Television>, not Cinema>.  I don't know how the
FM would handle spoilers from The Hobbit.

Second, we aren't talking about The Hobbit, which is one of the best selling
books ever written.  We're talking about The Walking Dead, which has a
readership of a few hundred thousand.

To make this clearer:

Far more people have read The Hobbit than have seen the movie.
Few people who watch The Walking Dead have read the original work (readers of
the comic make up about 3% of the viewing audience, according to comic book
sales (around 300K) and ratings (10 million for the first airing of the Season
3 finale).

An incredibly vast majority of people who watch the show have not read the
graphic novels.

saying "I think this is going to happen" because that would Spoil it.  We watch
a lot of movies and tv that I can guess a lot of times what will happen.  I
keep it to MYSELF so I do not Spoil it for the other person.

I now see why it is in place to not talk about what *might* happen because it
would Spoil it for someone else.  I stand with CL with his decision. I do Not
stand with Syops ignoring the Yell though.  than again we are talkng about KS
and always trying to start something.

If I would have watched whatever the hell show you area talking about I'm sure
you would have ruined it for me too.

Get over it, Move on and realize you shouldn't have done what you did. Learn
from it and stop bitching.

But the TV show is "inspired" by the comic.

It's not a direct adaptation.


I could probably fill 10 screens with all the shit from the comic that is NOT
the same as what is in the TV show.


So it's pretty dishonest to suggest that speculation about what the TV writers
will do, based on the comic, is somehow a "fact" not speculation.

Since they've changed, not used, or invented new stuff, in quite a lot of
cases compared to the comic.

If the sysops have decided that doing any reviews at all is an undue burden on
them, and thus whatever FMs do is unapealable and the final word, it'd be nice
if they changed the helpfiles to reflect that.

They were specifically talking about you, the number of reviews you have
requested over the years (not just the last two reviews), and were suggesting
that perhaps you get deleted so often because you don't follow the spirit of
the rules.  Obviously, that is debateable, but I don't think it's accurate to
suggest that the Sysops were claiming anything about an overwhelming workload.

They've done it twice.  In a year.  I'd be pretty surprised if I've yelled
appeals more than once or twice a year in ANY year since Bud Fields left, and
that was years ago.

Excluding BF specifically (and I won all those) I'd be shocked if in 20 years
on the BBS I've had more than 5 appeals... total... where the FM wasn't
overturned as being in the wrong.

Yes, the deletion and warning were upheld, but it has zero impact on your BBS

Not especially.  It's well beyond irrelevant since they took 2 months to review
it.


There's basically 2 issues-


1) Chris did a shitty job FMing.  That's no longer directly relevant regarding
my own post, but it'd be nice if, at MINIMUM, he either:


   a) Starting to properly FM according to how his FI reads now (which would
have meant my post was on topic)  OR

   b) Change his FI to reflect how he _actually_ runs the forum, which is even
something that is clearly speculation will be deleted if he doesn't like it, or
the poster.



2)  The sysops should just admit they no longer wish to do any work, and that
users shouldn't bother ever Yelling about any FM actions, because they just
don't give a shit and find any intrution on them a pain in the ass.



If 2 is NOT true then they ought clarify in what way submitting barely more
than 1 yell a year on average is an "undue burden" on their time.



Just about none of the above really has to do with "me" unless the answer to
either is: "No, we haven't actually changed the rules, we just decided we don't
like you and will ignore them in your case"... and that's fine too if they'd
simply admit it.  If it's not then they need to address as above and it's
nothing at all to do with me really.

I do.  Your post was off-topic.
It doesn't matter how adamantly you claim otherwise.  I found the post to be in
violation of the FI, and the Sysops agreed.  The FI is going to remain as is,
and I'm going to continue to enforce it in the exact same way.  You will need
to make peace with that.  No matter how many times you claim otherwise, and how
many times you respond saying the exact same thing, that is not going to
change.

"Just about none of the above really has to do with "me" unless the answer to

That's pretty much what they said, only they were nicer about it.
They find that you abuse the process, and were letting you know that this is
the case.   You can continue to argue that point, but that's not going to
change either.  You're adding nothing new to this discussion, and saying
nothing that you haven't already said.

Not according to the actual review.  There is nothing in the review that
suggests that they based their decision on this review on the frequency with
which Knightshade requests reviews:

"This is a "looks like, smells like" issue for us.  You presented
something that looked like a spoiler without the required warning.  The
fact that, in then end, it was not accurate, is irrelevant.  The FM
followed a common sense approach of acting on your post, which looked like
a spoiler."

That's the basis for the decision.  Only after discussing the decision to
uphold the deletion do the Sysops address review frequency.


"And it'd be nice if they let us now how often was ok."

There is no "us" here.  Even a brief reading of the review indicates that the
Sysops weren't talking about reviews by the userbase, and are only discussing
the frequency with which a single user, you (Knightshade) requests reviews.
You keep focusing on your last two reviews, as if you haven't been on the BBS
for 20 years.

That opinion has been shared by at least a couple of the users of the forum who

And nobody said that they didn't want to do their jobs anymore.  They said that
they felt that Knightshade demands a disproportionate share of their time.  In
spite of that, they did the review anyway.

Whether or not they are upheld doesn't necessarily matter, though.
The whole reason that we have the "common sense" policy is that some users
would frequently toe the line of the rules, get deleted, then ISCA lawyer their
way out of the deletion, since Sysops did not have very much leeway when a user
broke the spirit of the rules without breaking the letter of the rules.  That
behavior is the sole reason that the "common sense" policy exists.

While perhaps only five reviews didn't go your way (that's more reviews than
I've requested my entire time here, and more reviews than I've had done for my
deletions as an FM), thats not an indication that the process hasn't been
abused in the past.

Except that:

Speculation is allowed.


I'm going to say it one more time, so everyone is clear.
Revealing what happens in the story, based upon what you've read in the
original work that the adaptation is based upon is NOT speculation, not by any
sane or actual definition of "speculation."  Calling that "speculation" does
not magically make it so.

A couple examples:

Speculation:  I speculate that Will Smith dies in the end of I Am Legend.

NOT Speculation:  I speculate that Will Smith dies in the end of I Am Legend.
I base this speculation on the book, which I have read.

ending in December of 2012?  Apparently, at least a few people out there did.

In the case of Rick's call, I felt I did have some advance knowledge after
reading Knightshade's post.  I was expecting it to all just be in Rick's head,
though I could have been wrong I suppose.

Knightshade with regards to iPads and whether brakes are better than tires with
deliberate statements being made to provoke one side or the other which

I'll go back to an analogy that I used several years ago when the original

ISCABBS is my community (to be quite honest, it's been more real to me than my
own community that my home is in). Would I like it if a property owner came
around and built an establishment where everybody going into the establishment
constantly caused trouble and fights? No, if I don't like being in that type of

with having the rest of my neighborhood dragged down by the negative
consequences that such an establishment would bring.

hurt you again.  People don't change.

That's a post that NEVER was deleted from WWW> back in Oct 20, 2011. I don't
have the full text, but it was an obvious flame worthy of Rages>. Yet it was
never, ever deleted.

Yet a similar flame-fest was initiated by the same user on another forum, and
the FM for that forum did stomp down on this behavior.

it isn't like new people will join ISCABBS only because it has a Rages> forum.

The reason ISCA has/had this unique Forum would be because unlike other web
forums or social sites, ISCABBS has an actual process for everything. Accounts
are validated, moderators are chosen, sysops are voted, and *FMs are subject to
a BBS-wide rule on how to FM stuff*. While most web boards will be ruled under
the premise of "whatever the admin feels like today", if an FM gets emotional
or stupid on his FMing of a given forum, you can report him via Yells. See how
Bud Fields got de-FMed. So the "no flame" rule is mostly applied on all forums,
leaving no room for snarkiness. That was what would be sent to Rages>.

It probably isn't seen as something wanted by some users, because the enforcing
of the no flames rule hasn't been much followed recently. The post I referenced
earlier was part of a multiforum flamefest which was mostly off topic, or was
metadiscussion posing as on-topic while it was actually flaming. So probably
the mindset isn't that Rages> isn't needed, but more like "shit, if flames are

done a good job of backing up the FMs decisions unless the FM just did an
absolutely horrible job defending their position.

Not having Rages> or Ambush> will also not lead to this feared "sanitization"

mean that there won't be any harsh words said or meaty gossip to follow. While
we all are adults here, I don't expect that any of us will be perfect, and we
will all, in one form or another, say and do things that are aggressive, hurt

People weren't really flaming each other in a serious way for the most part but
it was pretty damn funny and creative. People obeyed the blackhole rule and the
bbs outside Rages> was doing well, imho.

I remember the days of Goddess of DOS, Dr No and a few others who would go at
it nearly nonstop but it wasn't annoying to read, unlike Ambush.

There were paragraphs of "decent" material (by Rages> standards anyway). Ambush
was just one liners and homophobic statements or repeated postings of the Opie
confession without any commentary.

I would like to add that you shouldn't have to flame anyone in the new Rages>
if it is created by the Sysops. As long as it rises to the level of snark, it
should be topical.

Since there are so few users left, I hope the Sysops will give it a chance,
even if for only 30 days as a trial period to see how people behave in and
outside of Rages>

As far as "ISCA processes" and policies and procedures go, I've always been
skeptical of the efficacy of ISCA policies even back when we had a 500-man

talking about politics, and current events, and music, and technology, and my

I'm trying to imagine myself going on Facebook one day and finding there's as

Facebook thinkgs that's a good feature for the site?  Idiotic.

Or some new web browser comes out and there's a Kike button you can set up to
call people antisemetic names.  Why the fuck.....

insulated from snark or flamage. CL says it better than I can but I feel the
same way.  If we are that weak and can't just not read it and not pay it any
attention, then we're not grown up.  Sure, most folks grow up and learn not to
insult others but there will always be people who do that and
sometimes/occasionally/often for reasons such as venting. I'm sure if Bud
Fields was still here, plenty would love to use Rages> to take at least one
shot at him for how he ran Late Breaking News> but that's beside the point.

Maybe if I was 20 I'd care about being flamed but at 40+ I could care less what
people post in Rages> because I know for a fact it won't disrupt the BBS given
the diligence of Sysops and FMs working together to enforce the blackhole
policy.

Modern clients, if 1994 is modern, have a built in enemy-list and the ability
to hide enemy post kills.

Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. A Christian
told me that one time, FWIW. ;-)

I'm not seeking to be insulated from snark by some overseeing hive mind bent on
saving me from the internet's perils.  I'm capable of reading or not reading
what I please.

I just don't understand why we want this room.  Just as CL can't understand any
reason not to have Rages, I can't understand any reason why we want it.
There's a serious disconnect that I'm just not bridging.  The answer cannot be,
"Just don't read it if you don't like it."  That doesn't make any sense.  If
somebody proposed a room called "Raping Babies>" and I opposed it on grounds
that it's not really the kind of thing we want on the BBS, nobody with a soul
is going to say, "just don't read it."

Whether or not we want this room on ISCA is the issue.  I don't understand why
we do.  I am having trouble coming up with any justification for it.  I am
trying to think of other internet services, including those that cater to
assholes, fuckheads, douchebags, racists, homophobes, zealots, sexists,
misogynists, and any other form of huamn scum, and even those sites generally
don't go out of their way to provide a rumpus room for people to indulge their
worst social instincts by attacking other members of the community.

I don't understand why we - a site that prides and differentiates itself on
moderation and, in the modern era, being peopled largely by working adults and
professionals - want to include such a thing in our offerings.

Does not compute.

"I personally feel that people shouldn't be guided by the hand as adults..."

This is part of what a Forum Moderator does, though. He or she makes sure that
those participating in a discussion stick to the rules, whatever they may be.
Most people can be trusted to do just that, but just in case it drifts out of
the scope of the discussion, the moderator guides it back to where it goes.

Nobody is insulating or holdign anybody's hand. If you REALLY feel that you
need to flame somebody, then leave them an eXpress message or Mail>, and that
person can then decide how they want to deal with you. Or, take you rown
advice, if somebody's comments in a discussion forum incite you to reply with a
flame, then perhaps you should use a client and e-list them rather than break
both forum rules and BBS-wide rules.

I don't see any reason why we make an exception for that.

As far as Weird> goes some stuff is allowed to slide but I haven't been able to
keep up with the scroll because I've been working 80+ hours a week. I'm going
to be able to devote a lot more time to keeping up with Weird> because I
decided I've had it with self-employment and long hours, and want to become a
corporate grunt/whore/cog/clockwatcher so I can leave work AT work again. Oh
god how I miss leaving work at work - and not being double and triple taxed
will be a nice plus as well.

Why I let a lot of stuff slide: a lot of the things people complain about are
things you really need to read into to know the intent. They're usually not
direct personal attacks, and even if they are they are usually so ridiculous
that no reasonable person would take them seriously (e.g., "Bugcrusher eats
babies!"  and "BugCrusher is the devil!") regardless of context. With the
ridiculousness that goes on I fail to see the point of putting the hammer down
on some of it. When I do read the posts (every chance I get - which isn't often
enough the last couple of months) when I come across anything that's too direct
or personal, or could be construed to be real, it gets deleted. Those posts
really do not happen too often - and even two-user bickerfests die down pretty
quickly. It is a fluff forum.   It's not like Serious> or Military> or
Political*> where any real discussion takes place.    It's not allowed to
degenerate to the festering cesspool that Ambush> was, but it's not always
sunshine and lollipops either. We're all adults here - chronologically
anyhow ;) so why not grow up a little bit, and develop a sense of humor, or at
least grow a thicker skin?

Weird> was absolutely horrible when I first started moderating it. We had some
of the perpetual trolls (all of them have since either been permatwitted or
left of their own volition) shitting all over the place, and were particularly
bad in Weird. It is nothing like that any more, and I'd rather it not be as
strict as Font had it back in the day - because clamping down too hard on the
fluff forums will only drive more users off the BBS.

What was said is that "we're grownups."  That's appears to be said as a

"Just as CL can't understand any reason not to have Rages, I can't understand

I think we want it because people use it.  It was a high scrolling forum.
There are clearly users who enjoy it being here, and with no current shortage
of forum space, I can't think of a good reason not to have it.  There are some
people who want it.  That's clear, because it was used.  I don't know that we
need a reason other than that.

You're saying "I can't understand any reason why we want it," but when you say
"we," you really don't mean "we," you mean you.  You don't want it, and that's
cool, but there are clearly people who do, because on this BBS, where there are

Facebook and YouTube are not experiencing flamewars because they don't have a
dedicated lfamewar space.  They are experiencing flamewars because they don't
police their content.

To whoever was bitching that ISCA is accepting comments on creating a new room
-- the reason ISCA is doing this is because that's how ISCA does things, and
ISCA does things taht way because there are finite resources here (for now) and
one of ISCA's strengths is thoughtfully considered divisions of topicality.

Whether Rages is sufficient distinct isn't at issue, though, it's sort of a
higher level question of whethe the room is something we (and I mean "we" as in
"the community of ICSA users" and not as in "Denny Crane the user," regardless
of how CL would posture my statement) want.  I don't want it, and others don't
want it.  I am giving reasons why.  Others are disagreeing and providing their
rationale.  THis is called a "conversation" or "discussion" and it's one of the
things ISCA does well.

We should not be asking "Why should we do this?" in any forum creation
situation. Rather, we should be asking "What are the compelling reasons not to

using it" is a compelling reason.  "It detracts from other forums" is a

Why would we want to encourage this? Even if the BBS itself cannot be held

You want to talk rules?  Ok, here are the rules:

Behave yourself as you would if someone's guest in real life. Disrupting
the flow of discussion or breaking forum <i>nformation rules may result in
deletions, warnings, or <k>ickouts. Disrupting BBS-wide functions may
result in warnings or write-suspension.

It is the Sysops' responsibility to ensure effective communication on ISCABBS.
Forum moderators, selected and supervised by the Sysops, are to ensure that
disruptive posts do not remain in the forums for which they are responsible.
FMs should use discretion reasonably to determine what is disruptive, giving
the benefit of the doubt to the poster.

To assist FMs, the following Guidelines and Definitions have been developed by
ISCA:

Guidelines
-----------

Unless otherwise specifically permitted by the forum information:

     Disruptive posts include, but are not limited to, those post that contain;
        personal attacks,
        metadiscussion,
        non-topical content, or
        excessive babble;

        and

     Disruptive behavior includes, but is not limited to;
        spamming, or
        excessive self-deletion of topical posts.


Definitions
------------

  Personal attacks: statements made about another user (or can reasonably be
    assumed to be about another user) for the sole purpose of insulting them or
    their beliefs, or baiting them into responding in a similar fashion.

  Metadiscussion:  discussion of the forum information; a user's
    posting style; or FM decisions or indecisions.

  Spamming: repetitive posting of a post(s) or substantially similar post(s) in
    one or more forums.

Goverment authorities would have shut down Yahoo News and a number of other

Nothing ever happened to Isca either. Whenever someone threatened someone - and

Whisper/Blond Pride/Spirit aka Michael Rouse comes to mind. He was swiftly

Again, I think these are crocodile tears being shed about "liability" of the

group of thin skins being afraid of having their feathers ruffled maybe twice

very clearly documentended and it's been clearly documented to the Sysops since
1993. Rages> won't stop flaming.

"If we can provide a place for a few uers to vent their frustrationss, it won't
increase or decrease anything."

As a general rule, we do not create forums for just a few users to participate
in. There must be broad interest in a forum for the Sysops to consider it.
Quite honestly, it would be more userful for us to create a Two User
Bickerfest> forum for FMs to drop unweidly circle-jerks into, but again, we
don't create forums for the purpose of only a few users to duke it out, and
thus that proposal has fallen flat every time it's been proposed.

I've already stated it's good for venting and how it will reduce flamage in
other forums, not just "I want it". I've said that Rages> did not impact the
BBS in a harmful way when it existed and in fact the Sysops never "axed"
Rages>. They upgraded it with an anonymous function and renamed it Ambush>.

The reason why Ambush> is gone is because of the low quality of posts there.
It was boring enough that someone complained and the Sysops voted to remove it.

It's not because it was harmful to the BBS. Rages> was at its peak in 2000 or
so and no action was taken to remove it at that time. If Rages> is such a
threat it should have been removed in 2000.

Sysops let it stand. Heck, Sysops would come into Rages> to join in the "fun
and games", so to speak.

I ask too, "Why _not_ have a Rages> forum? We already have a lot of silly and
stupid forums that don't add anything to the character or community of this

This is false. Rages> was gone and deleted for a few years before Ambush> was

Who left the BBS simply because of Rages>?

Where is the "documented fact" that it didn't reduce flamage in other forums?

If Rages> was so bad and deleted for a few years then why was it reintroduced
with an anonymous function?

CL said it best:

Jul 3, 2012 08:47 from Copper Lethe

"How many chances does it need?  It's been added and removed in various
incarnations and with different rules more times than any other forum on this
BBS (at least to my knowledge).  It has never worked since I've been here"

It has never not worked.  It has been added and removed because someone has
made a proposal, and Sysops voted to remove.  There's nothing more to it than
that.  For the most part, Ambush> and Rages> before it have never been problem
forums, and the BBS has not been worse off for having them.  It's not the forum
not working that results in it's deletion, it's someone getting offended and
writing a proposal that passes that has resulted in it's deletion.

[Forum Proposals> msg #42507

What was said is that "we're grownups."  That's appears to be said as a
justification for not re-created forums like Rages>.  I'm saying why that
doesn't make sense to me.

"Just as CL can't understand any reason not to have Rages, I can't understand
any reason why we want it."

I think we want it because people use it.  It was a high scrolling forum.
There are clearly users who enjoy it being here, and with no current shortage
of forum space, I can't think of a good reason not to have it.  There are some
people who want it.  That's clear, because it was used.  I don't know that we
need a reason other than that.

You're saying "I can't understand any reason why we want it," but when you say
"we," you really don't mean "we," you mean you.  You don't want it, and that's
cool, but there are clearly people who do, because on this BBS, where there are
forums with four or five year old posts still in the scroll, Ambush> rolled
over multiple times a week.

[Forum Proposals> msg #42505

He gave compelling reasons. I gave my reasons.

The other side is simply the party of "no".

I rest my case.

Who left the BBS because of Rages>? My wife did. When the non-stop attacks did
not let up, she let her account time out and decided it was not worth coming
back.

Why was Ambush> introduced? Because at the time somebody created a proposal for
it, and it went through the same vetting process as this proposal is. At the
time, after user feedback and Sysop considerations for that feedback, it was
deemed that Ambush> was a good forum that would serve a useful purpose for the
BBS as a whole.

And then, after several years, a deletion proposal was made because that forum
no longer served a useful purpose. Rages> will not serve a useful purpose.


Where is the documented fact that it did not reduce flamage? Ask any FM or any
Sysop who had to delete a post for flames. As a former FM myself, I had to
delete many a post while Rages> was around for flames. It didn't stop flames
happening in other forums. It only gave me an excuse to tell the flamers where
they could go after I sanctioned them. I can't say with any certainty that
things were worse, but I can definitely say that they did not get better.

Things only got better when we adopted a BBS-wide policy that users were
expected to act in a civil manner towards each other, and if they could not do
so then to refrain from making any comments.

So, let's be honest here -- any arguments about whether Rages> will have a net
positive effect on other forums is dead end. People who wish to flame are not
going to take pause and think, "Oh, I can't do that here, I need to go to
Rages>." If they stopped and though about it to begin with, it would be, "Oh, I
can't do that here." The end. If they're going to flame, they're going to do so
on purpose and in clear violation of the forum and BBS rules, whether or not
Rages> exists.

So, back to the merits of the room itself.

Your wife could have zapped the forum and been done with it without having to
leave the bbs.

Your argument seems to be that Rages> was so bad the Sysops just had to delete
it due to user (and Sysop) outrage. However, logic would dictate that if Rages>
was so bad then certainly they would reject any future proposal of a
replacement forum (especially one worse with anon option) out of hand. It would
be even far less likely that they'd actually vote for Ambush> in that case.

It doesn't add up for me. Sorry, I just don't accept your points.

One opinion about it not reducing flamage is anecdotal at best.
You aren't even sure if it increased flamage, so Rages> is neutral to the
"health" of the bbs if I adopt your view. In other words, not detrimental.

Good reasons for Rages> to be reintroduced are, as CL pointed out, that it
really did work fine in the past.

It would have appeal to enough users out there to be worth creating as other
forums haven't scrolled in years and Rages> historically had good scroll. Even
if other forums scrolled, it is still worth creating due to the appeal to
enough users who really want to vent frustrations or post just for shits and
giggles. Some users may just want to post weird flames, which wouldn't fit
Weird> criteria since they're flames but weird enough that no one is going to
take it seriously - yet it will be fun to read.

Many, but not all, people who wish to flame outside Rages> will think, "At
least I can vent in Rages> and not get kicked out or deleted from a forum". I
know that's my way of thinking and I've seen other users who took their
arguments *out* of a forum and into Rages> where it belonged. Yes, some are
obtuse and will flame within a forum anyway, but I don't believe most will.

Some don't want to post in Rages> but _enjoy reading the content_. I can't tell
you how many times I've enjoyed reading dozens of posts on a regular basis in
the forum in its golden years but didn't post myself.

Some, oddly enough, enjoy being flamed in Rages> and getting a chance to
respond. Any attention is good attention to them.

Not everyone is the same. Some need to vent or they might leave the bbs. That's
another reason to create a release valve type of forum such as Rages>.

I've listed several reasons and most of them overlap with what CL said, but I'm
sure what he said was ignored and then I'll be ignored, but what the hell.

People on their moral high horse are more annoying than anything I read in
Rages> over the years.

Rages> was pretty much a permanent flaming forum, and hell, it was fun. A
venting area is required in here *because* of the way ISCABBS works. Yahoo
Groups, Facebook, et al have nothing close to ISCABBS' policy, therefore there
is no need for a venting area because *
all* of the place is unregulated.

On the "growing up" issue, really, the whole point of growing up also involves
managing bullying. It isn't like some 13 year old kid is going to kill
him/herself because Paladin Grendel called her a dirty druglord wetback. We've
all survived trolls from the past and present; I've just turned 31 today
(wee!!) and I've learned to cope with this. Most of the remaining BBS userbase
is older than me, some are even decades older. Ironically, arguing against
Rages> on the "grown up" argument strays into "Political Correctness Gone Mad"
territory, that is, "nanny state". (I'm doing a Govt-ISCA analogy as it is
mostly how it works.)

I was here when Rages> got axed. The main reason it got axed was because of
Sysop administrative overhead back then, and less about ISCA liabilities. It
isn't like the Sysops are going to be overloaded with admin stuff in there, and
the liabilities are mostly gone as ISCA, Inc. is no longer tied to UIOWA (which
was the reason for most of the stricter stuff in here, like the ID requirement
for Kama>.)

Bullies offline can be managed by standing up to them.  When you are ready,
willing, and able to go toe to toe with the bully, they will back down.  if
they don't, and you kick their ass, they learn not to mess with you.

Online, a bully doesn't have to back down, they can engage in verbal

I also don't see why you suddenly hate Rages> when you took all that time to
propose a lengthy legal disclaimer for that very forum.

Admit it:  you guys are just afraid of getting libeled in Rages>
[Forum Proposals> msg #42524 (29 remaining)] Read cmd ->

Meh. First of all, in order to be libeled, it has to be statements that
would be construed to be true by a reasonable person. Secondly, it will be
a guessname or invite-only forum, with "black hole" rules, not a publicly
available one, so that mitigates the libel issue further. If someone were to
post "ZOMG! Turanga Leela eats babies! OMNOMNOM!" no sane person would believe
that to be true, but just a juvenile statement.

Secondly I'd expect to be one of those flamed given my past behavior years ago
on this BBS - and at the time it was well-deserved. It will happen though if
the forum is created because most of us are old-time users on here since the
'90s and users have long memories and tend to hold grudges. When it happens,
so what? There is no real harm done.

I'm indifferent to the forum. I'll follow it because I have to, and I might
even post from time to time. I just don't want a repeat of the pointless circle
jerk that resulted from Nikk's brain fart of a forum idea. You know, every so
often he emails me to brag about how well he's doing (mutual friends indicate
otherwise FWIW ;)) and from time to time he has bragged about how well Ambush>
worked out. Anyone here knowing Nikk's story on this BBS would be wise to avoid
any ideas that he would be proud of. ;)

Now having said all that (man, I must sound like a politician right now with
all the flip-flopping!) I think KAM has it right - if there is no reasonable
argument to object and the users want it, I think we should create it - and
as CL pointed out, regardless of personalized opinions against it.

My indifference comes from lack of caring one way or the other about the forum.
I've temped both Ambush> and really, /really/ do not want to see that style
forum on here again, because it really is the same 2-3 users in that tired old
circle jerk. They should just get a room, have a threesome and get their latent
homosexuality out in the open, IMHO. That kind of thing is more appropriate for
a user-created private forum once we move to Gestalt (in 1997? 1998?).

Rages would get more support from me because of the non-anon nature, and
because it was far more creative in its style. Almost poetic at times, even.
Also, managed /correctly/ I don't see how it could harm the BBS. If it is
managed as badly as Ambush> was designed, it will likely drive more users from
the BBS. We also need to think about web interfaces will handle guessname and
invite-only forums once we /finally/ migrate to gestalt, since the very
nature of web interfaces makes it more public. So, it's not just the
implications of how the forum would affect the BBS /as it exists today/ but
how will it impact ISCA over the long term?

Lastly: once we do move to the web, do we want the BBS to read like it is
populated by twelve year olds?

I'm a bit behind, but here are some quick responses to some key points:


"Why shouldn't we be asking why we should do this?"

Because if "why should we do this" is the question that we ask, we are
defaulting to "no," essentially.  I think are general attitude should be "yes,"
unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.

"I'm not seeing ONE positive reason to have this forum at all"

I think that post volume is a positive, and just having a forum that some
people want is a positive.


"All I've seen on the flip side of the discussion boils down to "I want it."
Which is all well and good.  And when my 5 year old goddaughter whines about
"But I waaaaaaaaant it," I tell her, "Good.  Builds character.""

That's not my argument at all.
My argument for it is that other people want it.  It has always been a high
scrolling forum, and at a time when we have forums that haven't scrolled in
five years, we shouldn't delete forums that scroll in days.

That said, "I want it" is a far more compelling argument than "I don't want
it."  "I don't want it" is an argument that attempts to deny something to
others, which is, to me, exactly the opposite of what we should be working to
do.

"As a general rule, we do not create forums for just a few users to participate
in. There must be broad interest in a forum for the Sysops to consider it."

Many people participated in Ambush>.   It had as many readers as any other
popular forum on the BBS.

"I disagree, it will not, it did not, and this is documented fact."

I don't think that this is true, and it's certainly not documented.  On an
anecdotal level, however, I have seen Rages> used to reduce personal attacks in
other forums.  I have seen FM's tell users to take it to Rages>, and I have
seen users do this.

Rages>
I'm still a ways back in the scroll, but wanted to get in my two cents.  First,
I'm surprised at all the opposition.  I requested feedback more than once
before <y>elling and got very little apart from some advice on how to curb
ISCA's legal liability (thank for that, BTW).

But what really surprised me was the references to allowing whores to move in
down the street, etc.  Sure, what we have here is an online community, but it's
also an entertainment medium.  Maybe some folks don't like movies with a lot of
sex and violence but there's a market for it.  The historical scroll for these
forums demonstrates--adequately, I think--a demand for them.

And I don't think anyone has made the case that there is a "need" for the
forum.  The proposal is even written explaining it as a fluff forum.  We don't
need most of the fluff forums we have here, but we have them anyway, because
they're entertaining and they generate scroll.

I never leaned too hard on the idea that Rages> would take the ugly stuff out
of the other forums too much because it's not really an important point IMO.  I
wanted to leave it out of the proposal but a lot of folks had made the point
before.  In any case, I do believe that it would.  I've personally seen folks
take discussion out of legitimate forums to Weird> and Non Seq> in order to
flame and snark people, so I know it happens.  I just don't know if I feel like
it should be our primary reason for creating the forum (I'd go more with the
"entertainment" argument.)

Lastly, and I know it's already been mentioned, but it is a simple forum to
<z>ap and forget.  The black hole policy is there to keep Rages> from bleeding
into other forums and getting in your face when you don't want to participate.

I can appreciate the reasons not to participate or support the forum.  I
personally enjoyed reading (and occasionally participating in) the original
Rages> and would love to see it come back.  I saw Ambush> as a mockery/shadow
of Rages> and didn't mourn its passing.  I like the idea of seeing a name with
the post, especially if we know it could be objectionable.  In Rages>, you have
to own it.

My ad hoc research suggests that following defamation suits against ISPs in the

"publisher" liability for defamation posted by others.  I'm just not sure what

They use, among other things, the size of Pluto as a reason to demote it yet
Mercury is smaller than Titan, Ganymede and probably several other moons (most

Triton is by far the largest of Neptune's moons.  Despite its large size,
Triton probably did not form around Neptune.  Scientists believe that Triton
was captured by Neptune long ago.  So where did this large world form?  Many
scientists today believe that Triton formed as a planet far out in the Solar
System.


I admit this site is a bit dated (only lists Pluto as having 2 moons when in
reality it has 5 moons). I dropped them a message on their Facebook site

(sorry for the repost)

An issue with measuring by "size" is that there is both volume and mass.
The orderings of solar system objects changes quite a bit if you order by
one over the other.

One big requirement for a planet is that they are not orbitting
another planet, which is why Mercury gets a pass.  Also, Mercury is
more massive than any moon, although there are some that have more
volume.

The problem with Pluto is not so much that it's smaller and less
massive than some moons, it's that it's smaller than some other
objects directly orbitting the sun.  Eris out-classes it in both mass
and volume.

from "Star Wars," is orbited by two more stars -- a solar system that is the
first of its kind known.
The alien planet, called PH1, is a gas giant planet slightly bigger than
Neptune. Its discovery in the midst of a strange, four-star planetary system is
the first confirmed world discovered as part of the Yale University-led Planet
Hunters project, in which armchair astronomers work with professional
scientists to find evidence of new worlds in the bountiful data collected by
NASA's Kepler space telescope.
"Planet Hunters is a symbiotic project, pairing the discovery power of the
people with follow-up by a team of astronomers," said Debra Fischer, a
professor of astronomy at Yale and planet expert who helped launch Planet
Hunters in 2010, in a statement. "This unique system might have been entirely
missed if not for the sharp eyes of the public."


Since its March 2009 launch, Kepler has found evidence of more than 2,300
candidate alien worlds. [Gallery: More Alien Planets with Twin Suns]

Finding a strange, new world
Since its initial discovery via Planet Hunters, the existence of PH1 has been
confirmed by a team of professional astronomers, who will present their work
today (Oct. 15) at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of
the American Astronomical Society in Reno, Nev.
With a radius about 6.2 times that of Earth's, PH1 is a smidge bigger than
Neptune. The gassy planet spends 138 days completing a single orbit around its
two parent stars, which have masses about 1.5 and 0.41 times that of the sun.
The stars circle each other once every 20 days.
The two other stars orbiting the PH1's twin suns are about 1,000 astronomical
units (AU) from the parent stars. (One AU is about the distance between the
Earth and sun, about 93 million miles or 150 million kilometers.)
If you're hoping to catch the quadruple sunset, this may not be your best bet.
The researchers estimate PH1's temperature would range from a minimum of about
484 degrees Fahrenheit (524 Kelvin, or 251 degrees Celsius) and a maximum of
644 degrees F (613 Kelvin, or 340 degrees C), too hot to be in the habitable
zone.
"Although PH1 is a gas giant planet, even if there is a possibility of rocky
moons orbiting the body, their surfaces would be too hot for liquid water to
exist," researcher Meg Schwamb of Yale University and colleagues write in a
draft of their research article.

A planet with two suns
Until now, scientists had identified just six planets orbiting two parent
stars, called circumbinary planets, and none of these have stellar companions
orbiting them. Until their discovery, circumbinary planets were once the realm
of science fiction with Tatooine, the fictional homeworld of Luke Skywalker in
"Star Wars," among the most famous.
"Circumbinary planets are the extremes of planet formation," Schwamb said in a
statement. "The discovery of these systems is forcing us to go back to the
drawing board to understand how such planets can assemble and evolve in these
dynamically challenging environments."
The Planet Hunter volunteers, Kian Jek of San Francisco, Calif., and Robert
Gagliano of Cottonwood, Ariz., spotted PH1 using the transit method, noticing
faint dips in light as the plant passed in front of, or transited, its parent
stars.
Gagliano said he was "absolutely ecstatic" about the finding. "It's a great
honor to be a Planet Hunter, citizen scientist, and work hand in hand with
professional astronomers, making a real contribution to science," he said.
Jek, too, expressed his amazement.
"It still continues to astonish me how we can detect, let alone glean so much
information, about another planet thousands of light-years away just by
studying the light from its parent star," he said in a statement.
Schwamb led the team of professional astronomers who confirmed the discovery
and characterized the planet, following observations from the Keck telescopes
on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
The research was supported by NASA and the National Science Foundation
Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship.

Astronomers can predict how many objects of a certain size exist in places they
haven't looked by seeing how many are in places they have looked.

I'm skeptical that in the next 50 years we will find a KBO bigger than Mercury,
because the ones we have been finding have been only about a third the radius
of Mercury, and it's easier to see the bigger things.  Maybe there's one there
that we can't see because it's very dark, but that will still diminish our
ability to find it.

I wouldn't rule it out categorically, though.

So what do we think about the earthquake scientists recently convicted for
giving scientific advice that turned out to be inaccurate?  Worrying isn't it?

For example, http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20025626
Six Italian scientists and an ex-government official have been sentenced to six
years in prison over the 2009 deadly earthquake in L'Aquila. A regional court
found them guilty of multiple manslaughter. Prosecutors said the defendants
gave a falsely reassuring statement before the quake, while the defence
maintained there was no way to predict major quakes.

The 6.3 magnitude quake devastated the city and killed 309 people. Many smaller
tremors had rattled the area in the months before the quake that destroyed much
of the historic centre. It took Judge Marco Billi slightly more than four hours
to reach the verdict in the trial, which had begun in September 2011.

Also having no idea of the Italian legal system in general and the liability
clauses in the scientists' contracts in particular, in my common sense the
important question is not whether the quakes are predictable, but what the
scientists claimed before the event in 2009.
        If their statement at the time was the same as their current defense of
"we can't predict these things", they should not be quilty.
        If their statement at the time was "we know what we are talking about
and we say there's nothing to fear", they are quilty of at least some
deception, specifically misrepresenting their abilities. Then the question is
        1) how the Italian legal system views one person's reliance on
another's deception leading to the believer's death, and
        2) for how many of the dead the prosecution can prove that they died as
a consequence of knowingly relying on their prediction.
        But I suspect the reality is not so black and white and the actual
statements were along the lines of "nobody can be sure, but we believe it is
unlikely that there is any real danger". At least this is how scientists in my
country tend to speak. And then, of course, you'd need a very good translation
to have an informed opinion on exactly how reassuring they were in their
statements. An in a court case like that, most likely the side with the better
lawyers wins anyway.

"The subsequent court case has been somewhat misreported. The convictions are
not because the scientists failed to predict the earthquake. Instead
prosecutors said they failed to communicate the known risks accurately.
Although it was De Bernadinis who made the public comments that there was no
danger, prosecutors say the scientists bear responsibility for not correcting
his comments."

I haven't read anything more about this case, but is there something in their
law that declares legal liability when giving odds about natural events?

I mean, if it was their job under law, and they knew that, and they did it
anyway, then too bad for them.

If your job is to measure and announce risk, and you fail to do so, then I
guess there are consequences.

If they were just scientists doing their own thing, and they announced some of
their findings without any expectation of accuracy given, then they are kind of
getting screwed.

   The scientists are supposed to have stated that there was no elevated risk
from earthquake in L'Aquila. However, the town is in the middle of Italy's most
earthquake-prone belt, which means that even a normal risk of earthquak is
quite high. The scientists have been convicted for an unhappy coincidence of
timing.
   One notes that the Italian courts have also decreed that cell phones cause
tumors; apparently in Italy courts believe they can decide questions, not
merely of the applicability of science to the law, but of science itself.
Italian scientists therefore have no further need to conduct tests or trials,
to establish control groups or do statistical analyses; they can just ask the
courts to resolve hypotheses for them.

I hadn't heard about this, but it just came up on a blog I read:
http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/?p=26291

Easy read, that one, but to try an even shorter summary, the STandard Model
predicts a certain set of decay rates and ratios of particles. If particles
beyond the Standard Model exist, like superparticles, then the ratios for decay
paths we do have available to measure will be different from those the Standard
Model predicts.

Moreover, the lower in mass the theoretical particles are, the more they affect
the rate. So the more precisely we measure a rate of decay and find agreement,
the heavier superparticles must turn out to be.

Apparently we have finally measured a super-rare decay ration of bottom-strange
mesons and another of bottom-down mesons (like, one in a billion events) and
they match very closely to the STandard Model. If they hold up, which is
likely, that means SUSY particles would have to be just astoundingly heavy,
and therefore much less likely to exist.

IIRC, there is evidence of the slowing of the EArth's rotation, but it's
entirely attributal to tides. I don't know that there's any evidence of the
Earth's revolution being slowed at all.

Dark matter doesn't really collide much with the Earth. For one, there's not
that much of it--it's pretty thinly and evenly spread. The entire amount of
dark matter in the entire solar system, according to one paper, is about the
mass of the asteroid Hygiea.

Admittedly, that's still more than the interplanetary dust cloud (to my
surprise!), but it's not a ton. There are two other effects that would cause it
to have less of an effect, though:

1) It doesn't interact much with normal matter. The reason dark matter is dark
is because it doesn't interact electromagnetically with other particles. The
catch is that _all_ normal matter interactions are electromagnetic--that's what
holds matter together. So as a rule, dark matter would pass right through the
earth--which is why it's so difficult to detect in our experiments. The only
way it would interact with the Earth would be via gravity.

2) However, because dark matter doesn't interact other than via gravity, it
spreads out into a fairly evenly distributed mass. This means that even with
the infinitestimal drag of having a tiny asteroid's mass somewhere in the Solar
System, it's not going to be pulling from one direction, but from all
directions at once... meaning that it would essentially cancel itself out.

Two thoughts:

1) Many natural systems are non-linear feedback loops of interaction, and
drawing any kind of linear conclusion like that is just not reasonable. It may
be significantly more complex than that.

2) The earth is very old. We are not capable of really measuring its long-term
trends and fluctuations, which are beyond our direct observational abilities.
Since we've been here a short time, it's really _really_ hard to know whether
we have had a big influence or if we are just riding a bigger wave of change
that would have happened anyway.

3) I'm a fairly scientifically-minded guy, and I trust that global warming
exists because smart people say it is so. But I've looked around, and I've not
(yet) found a readable, compelling case for believing that (a) we are a
significant cause and (b) we can do anything about it. Granted, I've not seen
Gore's movie. Maybe that clears it all up.

My point is, the case is being made, but not very well. The facts don't seem to
be very accessible.


I can read a book about Relativity and think "OMG, this is so obviously awesom,
that I am going to accept it!", or I can read a book on evolution and think
"wow, that really makes sense, I believe that."

I've not (yet) found the same convincing case for man-made global warming.

If it does exist, and is not an Al Gore movie, let me know where so I can check
it out.


PS - when I've expressed this viewpoint in the past, I've gotten beaten up as
being a "denier", which is kind of ridiculous and sad.

what I'm looking for is the evidence that supports bold claims like:

Over the last 150 years or so weve seen an increase in global temperatures that
is directly related to the change in pollution in the atmosphere

or

We know that our planet is getting warmer because there are more greenhouse
gasses in the atmosphere, but it is really our fault? Yes.

or

The other factors that have been naturally operating are no longer capable of
explaining the warming that we have observed

or

We know that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere right now are
higher than at any time in the last 800,000 years


I mean, I assume there is good science behind this. I would just like to learn
more about what it is, and I think that kind of evidence should be made more
accessible to people so they understand.

I also know that science can sometimes be wrong, even when 97% of scientists
agree about it. Science is certainly not immune to Big Mistakes, and certainly
not immune to scientists following along with the consensus because it's what
is expected of them.

I'm not sure this is an entirely reasonable standard, since we have fewer
Earths upon which we can experiment. It's quite possible for something to be
strong enough that most reasonable people will accept it as true without being
as well-tested as relativity.

  global temps are on the increase:
  http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/
  However, our data is but a mere fraction of time so it is hard to say
  is this an abnormal increase?

  The evidence with respect to effects are pretty clear:
  Snow/white reflects heat, darker colors absorb.
  So when the snow melts, more heat is retained. It has a doubling effect.
  The snow melt on the mountains has been happening sooner and sooner each
  year.

  CO2:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide#In_the_Earth.27s_atmosphere
  http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/co2.html
  http://cdiac.ornl.gov/

  what term is lame?

  I think the case is pretty strong.
  As you point out, they coudl be wrong. If there were a LONG history available
 of global temps it would be easier. The "data" we do have (layers of ice, etc)
  requires interpretation, which requires a theory and proof (again missing
  actual temps, makes it hard to say with 100% certainty a thin layer of
  ice that year meant higher temps, there could have been other reasons).
  And as someone else pointed out, there are rich lobbists coming up with
  a million counter theories.
  (Ironically, I think a few scientists got caught doing the same for
  climate change? exaggerating the numbers? or was that another lobbist
  hoax?)
  I rarely follow a crowd, but base on what I've read, I'm fairly convinced.
  I do my part to reduce my impact. I try to inform others so they can
  at a minimum reduce their impact as well (recycle, reduce, reuse, etc)
  and try to help reverse the problem. But I'm not that active (too little
  time).

  I do get REALLY get pissed off when the technology leader in the house
  (or was it the senate?) says that we don't have to worry about global
  warming because God said he wouldn't bring another flood.

JL>  For an idea of all the science behind the conclusion "yes, we're causing
it", take a look at the ipcc reports.

http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml#.U
L3juHfxbRY

I think the fourth assessment report is probably the best, see if there's a
good management summary to find out if they discuss the right things.  I
suspect you need report from working group 1: "The Physical Science Basis".

having been part (a very small part) of the research efforts, I can say that
there definitely is a lot of research behind it, and there are lots of aspects
all pointing toward the conclusion that yes, we're the cause.  It's because of
the possibility that they could be wrong, that they're so very careful with
real statements and conclusion of that nature.

From what I've seen in modelling, there's pretty much no question about it.  We
know we're the cause of the additional CO2, and if you put the additional CO2
in the models, you clearly see the temperature increase.  The amount by which
it varies is a different story - lots of different answers showing that the
feedbacks are very complex, and we can't really predict how bad it will be
accurately.  The range of temperature rise coming out of the ipcc assessment if
s quite large for that reason.

I'd say start here for the definitive material:

Oh, ocean modelling isn't really harder than weather modelling, it's actually
quite similar.  The biggest problem is that we're missing a lot of observations
for the ocean, which means the starting conditions for the model are much
worse, and some things (mixing in the upper layers) are not so well
represented.

Apart from that, the physics are almost the same in a lot of ways.

Of course you do get the same issue as with weather models, to do it properly
you need the biggest computer you can dream up, and then some.

It also is at big risk for hitting another satellite because it's not on any

spinning around, it's not like they could use it if it really is a satellite. 
There's thought that it's actually a test of a three stage rocket and it was
never meant to be a working satellite, so maybe they didn't bother with a
working navigational system in the thing.

Oh, I just found this.  The satellite basically only has a camera on it.

might simply be to be to put claymore type bombs up in space - just put them up
there, don't blow them up - you want bargaining chips after all. But, basically
if you had the right orbit and the right directionality and force of your
explosive, you could send your bits in a very costly reagion of our orbit - ie,
geosynchronous.

Not very expensive to produce, not very defensable, potentially highly

What do you do other than totally destroy the place? It's not like even our

shoot it down on its way to orbit. You obviously don't shoot it in orbit. Your
only bet is to know about the engineering of such a device on the ground and
destroy it and the people working on it before it's ready. However, I think
that this is a simple enough idea that the engineering would only require a few
people (besides the delivery mechanism) which could easily be hidden and kept
secret. Also, you're looking for depret, so if you only have a 1/10 success

   I don't think it's about "landing" -- satellites are generally not built to
land, and when they reenter they typically disintegrate. North Korea probably
does not have the ability to build a satellite they could retrieve.
   Where the tumbling is important is communication. To talk to your satellite,
either to get data from it or to get it to do things, it needs to be in a
stable orientation with the antenna pointed toward Earth. If it's tumbling
through its orbit, the antenna will be pointing every which way several times a
minute, or even a second (depending on the speed of rotation) and it will be
impossible to get a fix. So there will be no opportunity of retrieving data or
controlling it in any way.

so, the higher the frequency, the smaller the wave length which means, your
antenna can be smaller, your filtering system is smaller, and distance between
radio components necessarly need to be smaller or your circuit starts to
resonate. however the other reason to use higher frequencies is because hf
below 6 meters bounces off of the atmosphere all the time. Also, the ammount of
bandwidth you can use is directly related to the frequency and width of the
band you can use - in uhf and higher, you can use a much wider band for
communicating without stepping on anyone else's toes.

It occurs to me that one could create a very convincing AI by just setting up a
particular discourse context and a few keywords.  For example, restrict its
discourse to science and religion.  Then, feed it myths, legends, and
children's stories, with no need to differentiate them at all.  Connec thtem to
key words, so that, for example, "North Korea has launched a satellite" would
trigger "satellite > moon > 'man on the moon; green cheese'  You could also
encode long, meaningless screeds about crackpot theories of the origin of
religion, which it would spew at the drop of a hat.

Obviously, rather than trying to create a convincing "normal" intelligence, if
you give it an off-putting sense of humor, an inability to recognize proper
social situations, and weird orthographic tendencies (like placing
non-parentheticals in parentheses, or spelling out acronyms after using them,
or using all capitals for no clear reasons), you'll create a very convincing
intelligence because it will appear to be slightly off-kilter, rather than an
imperfet imitation of intelligence.

I suspect such a bot could pass the Turing test with flying colors.

Here's my take on AI...

Current attempts at AI lack context. That is, you can feed it "knowledge" about
a certain area, but under each term are mountains of layers of context that we
know about because of our life experience. An AI might know about the moon, but
you can't feed it all the moon experiences you have had over your entire life,
or all the other context that you know about planets, stars, tides, the man on
the moon, the moon landing, JFK, the russian space race, sputnik, layer upon
layer upon layer going all the way down to stories about explorers,
understanding what the earth is, etc etc.

I don't think we will have convincing AI until we have a computer that learns
"from birth" in the same way that a human does. It will need to take in
experiences and learn layer upon layer, so that it has sufficient context to
have an intelligent discussion.

This also relates to human "helper" technology like Siri or any to-do list app
you've ever tried. They are difficult to use because they lack your context.
They don't know all the things about your life that you do, so you have to
translate and pass context to them. You have to enter contact info, instead of
saying "email that guy from company X that I talked to last month".

I predict that in the future, we will have computers that live our lives with
us. Either aways attached to us, or perhaps even embedded into us. They will
capture our life experiences *with* us, in a slightly different mode, so that
we can communicate with this device in a way like it is almost an extension of
us. It will share our context and our knowledge. When we talk to someone, it
will recognize their voice and know who they are and be able to recall all the
previous experiences we've had with the person.

We're approaching that now with cell phones. They are starting to be observers
of ambient information like noise, motion, location, etc. As they get more
intelligent, they will passively monitor our lives *with* us, and be much
smarter about who we are and how we want to interact with them.

And, to go one step further... I believe this is a biological process. It's not
us intelligent carbon-based life forms creating some hardware that is cold and
lacking of life. It *is* life. Life is extended into silicon-based machines,
and we are extending our intelligence and consciousness into them. It's
evolution growing us a new appendage, except instead of being made out of lesh,
it's made out of transistors. It *is* biological, in every sense. Just in a
different form than we have been used to.

So, when all that happens, and we have machines that have "lived lives" and had
experiences and been tied to a human brain for years, then I believe we will
have true AI.

About the microscope: I found the distance adjustment for proper focus to be
quite critical, and it helped to move the slide slightly sideways, left, right,
left right, etc. while SLOWLY adjusting the focal distance. Then at the near
point you see something moving (the slide). Good luck and good health!

"Time is slowed by heavy gravity. Just as it's easier to swim through outer
space, than it is through the atmosphere, than it is through water, than it is
through rock, time moves more quickly through less dense gravity. Time passes
more slowly on Jupiter than it does here on Earth. And, as the impatient clocks
on the Mars rover prove, time passes more quickly on Mars due to its lighter
gravitational pull."

This article says that time is affected by gravity. I always thought that time
dilation was because of speed (or rather, the relative speed between the
objects), and not gravity.

It says that the twin paradox is caused by the gravity caused by near light
speed travel (well, the article says light speed, but I'll ignore that).

Is this article way off, or is there something I'm not aware of?

a "wall" of dark matter or dark energy, into a different domain of space.

Thinking out loud...

What evidence do we have for Entropy?

Doesn't it seem like the reverse is actually true, depending on how you looka t
it? Shit is spread out all over space, clumps together to form stars, which
are engines for creating different atoms, which combine together to create
life, etc, etc.

It seems like the natural order of the universe is to get *more* complex, not
less so.

And perhaps small, short-term things like an egg cracking or a tea pot
shattering are actually the small fluctuations of entropy in what is otherwise
a system whose tendency is to self-organize.

Rather than the opposite view, which is that life and complexity are the rare
fluctuations of reverse-entropy in a system which is generally going to shit.

So, what are the arguments against viewing the universe from this perspective?

The high degree of uniformity in the cosmic microwave background radiation
suggests that our universe began as an extremely ordered system. It's been all
downhill from there. If certain parts of the universe seem to be getting more
ordered it's only because you're not taking into consideration the energy flow
from other parts of the universe.

  That true? seems fairly logical, except the video implies that the solar

  it would be less pronounced (though maybe they did it to show the effect).

It depends entirely from which perspective you're observing the solar system.
If you imagine that the earth is stationary, the solar system is a bunch of
interlocking spirals.  If you imagine that the sun is stationary, the solar
system is a bunch of elipses.  If you imagine that the galactic core is
stationary, then it's a bunch of helixes.  The easiest of these to calculate is
of course if we imagine that the sun is stationary, and work from there.  But
it's just a choice of perspective.

  The sun is moving in the galaxy, the galaxy is moving in the universe....
  From a 'stationary' perspective (i realize that is a loaded statement,
  so let's go with the perspective of the galatic core), the video is
  correct. How about my assertion that the video exagerates the speed of
  the sun relative to the rotation of the planets?

It's not about whether it "is" or "is not" a vortex.

In thinking of it as a vortex, does that open up any new doors? Does it allow

  Related to the Dark Matter/wall post...is it stationary? Could we
  "throw an anchor" into a piece of dark matter and use that to
  'propell' a spaceship? Could we use dark matter/energy passing thru

What makes dark matter "dark" is that it doesn't interact with most of the

We don't know that Dark Matter is "passing through us" right now. That might be
true if Dark Matter is WIMPS: weakly interacting massive particles. But we
don't know if that is the correct interpretation. Dark Matter is not an
observed fact, but rather one way of explaing the observed rotation curves of
spiral galaxies (first observed by Vera Rubin) and the motions of galaxies in
clusters (first observed by Fritz Zwicky). But WIMPS is not the only possible
form that Dark Matter might take: Massive Compact Halo Objects (Machos) also
has its supporters. Further, there might not be any Dark Matter, but rather our
understanding of gravitational theory might be in need of adjustment. This is
called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MONDS) -- and is actually the explanation
prefered by Vera Rubin.

I grew up a few towns from Edmund Scientific, and while I love them, and
folks at the 8.3-meter telescope I'm operating right now buy stuff from
Edmund Optics, I've tried the AstroScan and can't recommend it for any
serious use at all.

At the Visitor Information Station here on Mauna Kea, we have (among other
things ;) a few different sizes of sturdy, kid-friendly Dobsonians from
Orion - http://www.telescope.com/

We use ones from the XT series, with no motor, computer or star catalogue;
they're great for showing people how to manually use a finder, point at
things in the sky, focus, et cetera, which of course are good things to
know no matter what telescope you've got.  Last summer break my eldest
spent many an evening gathering kids around her and teaching them so they
could teach their parents.

But they also have fully-computerized ones that will find tons of objects
for you, in their "IntelliScope" line.  On a $500 budget, I'd suggest
either a 6-inch computerized one, or an 8-inch manual one... UNLESS the
kids are really little (2-3 years old) in which case the eyepiece might
be too high to reach if you're pointing at a target overhead.  In that
case, I'd go for the 4.5-inch.  If you've got extra in your budget, get
some extra eyepieces for differing levels of magnification, or a neutral
density filter to dim the moon so you can look at it without destroying
your night vision.

Any of these will blow up the Moon real nice, let you see that Saturn
has rings, Jupiter has moons, and there are clusters and nebulae and
galaxies and stuff like that.

(And yes, I have taught 2-3 year-olds how to aim and focus a telescope.
Can't wait to teach my 1-year-old. :)

US Republicans agree to payroll tax deal

House of Representatives Republican Speaker John Boehner has agreed to accept a
bipartisan deal to extend a payroll tax cut, in an abrupt U-turn.

He had refused to vote on the bill, which was passed by Republicans and
Democrats in the Senate last Saturday.

Correspondents say the move amounts to a cave-in by House Republicans, and
victory for President Barack Obama.

Key elements of the Senate bill remain: an extension of the tax cut and
unemployment benefits for two months.

A Republican-backed clause forcing Mr Obama to make a decision on the
controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline within 60 days also remains.

The new deal will require Senate and House approval.

After briefing rank-and-file members of his party, Mr Boehner said in a news
conference that the House would vote before Christmas.

"We were here fighting for the right thing," Mr Boehner said when asked if he
had caved. "It may have not been politically the smartest thing to do."

President Obama, who with his Democratic allies has kept up relentless pressure
on Republicans over the stalemate, welcomed the announcement.

"This is good news, just in time for the holidays," he said in a written
statement. "This is the right thing to do to strengthen our families, grow our
economy and create new jobs."

Earlier in the day, the president read out messages at a news conference from
voters who said the package would help them pay their heating bills, visit
elderly relatives and treat their families to pizza dinners.

Unlike other budget stand-offs this year, this one has exposed Republican
divisions.

Earlier on Thursday, Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell broke
his silence on the issue to urge his House colleagues to pass the measure.

Two freshman House Republican lawmakers also called for a vote, breaking the
unified front shown by members of that chamber in a news conference on Tuesday.


Earlier in the week, other Republican senators lambasted their House colleagues
for opposing the deal.

And on Wednesday the Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial labelled the
episode a "fiasco" that could end up re-electing Mr Obama.

Many Republicans were initially sceptical about extending the payroll tax
break, which economists say would aid US economic recovery.

As party leaders demurred over how to offset the $120bn (#76bn) cost of the
plan, Democrats accused them of backing tax cuts only for the wealthiest
Americans.

Correspondents say Mr Boehner's about-turn reflects a realisation by
Republicans that they would have faced blame for an effective tax rise on
middle-class Americans in a general election year.

famed World War II group who used their native language as a weapon.
His family now hopes to carry out his dream of a museum in Arizona that also
will hold wartime memorabilia and serve as a haven for veterans. Mr. Little,
one of the most recognizable of the remaining Code Talkers, died of melanoma
Tuesday night at a Fort Defiance hospital, said his wife, Nellie. He was 87.
Mr. Little was 17 when he joined the U.S. Marine Corps, becoming one of
hundreds of Navajos trained as Code Talkers. They used a code developed by 29
tribal members that was based on the then-unwritten Navajo language. Their code
helped confound the Japanese and win the war.
"My motivation was to fight the enemy with a gun or whatever," Mr. Little told
the Associated Press in a July 2009 interview. "When I went into the Marine
Corps ... I knew nothing about the Navajo code. It was really astonishing to me
to get to Camp Pendleton and there were a bunch of Navajos there, and they were
working with a Navajo code."
Mr. Little, the longtime president of the Navajo Code Talkers Association until
his death, traveled the country seeking funding for the museum that is expected
to cost up to $30 million. He preached about the preservation of Navajo
traditions, culture and the language that the federal government tried to
eradicate before he and others were called on to use it during the war.
It was a story he never tired of telling, association secretary Yvonne Murphy
said.
"That was his life. That was the drive behind him," Murphy said Wednesday. "It
didn't matter where he was. If there were people who came and wanted to sit and
talk with him, he would share with them."
Nellie Little said her husband hoped the museum would be open by 2014 at its
proposed location just outside the Navajo Nation capital of Window Rock. But
she said more money is needed.
She is asking people to send museum donations rather than flowers for his
memorial.
Mr. Little's health had been deteriorating over the past year, as he went in
and out of hospitals between speaking engagements and appearances in parades -
the last time in New York in November for Veterans Day, the association said.
A video on the association's website features him speaking about the importance
of the unbreakable code. Fellow platoon members referred to the Navajos as
"walking secret codes," with each message having to be memorized and destroyed
after it was sent or received, Mr. Little says.
"That is something that in itself was marvelous," he said in the AP interview.
"It was so proficient and safe."
A public memorial is planned for Friday in Window Rock, with funeral services
scheduled Saturday in nearby Fort Defiance. Navajo President Ben Shelly has
ordered flags lowered across the reservation from today through Sunday in Mr.
Little's honor.

IRS contacts 1 in 8 millionaires for extra taxes

        Just 1 in 100 earning under $200K yearly

By Alan Fram, Associated Press | AP -- 20 hours ago

"The 12 percent of millionaire earners audited in 2011 was appreciably higher
than the 8 percent who were audited in 2010. IRS officials said the high ratio
was part of an effort to demonstrate that tax laws are applied fairly."

"In recent weeks, President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats have
sought to boost taxes on the wealthy as a way to pay for jobs programs, a theme
they are expected to continue in this presidential and congressional election
year. IRS spokeswoman Michelle Eldridge said the growing portion of millionaire
earners' returns audited is not related to politics."

"Between 2004 and 2009, the percentage of millionaire earners audited ranged
between 5 percent and 7 percent."

Woman Claims Hotel Gave Drunken Man Her Room Key

http://gma.yahoo.com/woman-claims-hotel-gave-drunken-man-her-room-221452428--ab
c-news.html

By CANDACE SMITH | Good Morning America
18 hours ago

A New York business woman is suing Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide,
claiming staff at one of their hotels gave her room key to a drunken man who
allegedly sexually assaulted her in her bed.

Alison Fournier announced the suit today at a news conference with women's
rights lawyer Gloria Allred.

According to the suit, Fournier was in her locked room in Hotel Kdmp, a hotel
operated by Starwood Hotels in Helsinki, Finland, on the night of Jan. 15, 2011
when she was sexually assaulted.

The man, who was "visibly intoxicated," had undressed, slipped into her bed,
and proceeded to grope her naked body, the suit says.

Fournier, who is represented by Allred and the New York firm Cuti Hecker Wang
LLP, is suing the company for negligence and negligent infliction of emotional
distress for an amount to be determined at trial.

Fournier was traveling to Helinski for work and said that she specifically
chose a Starwood hotel because of the company's reputation.

"Starwood is the go-to brand for business travelers and I expected a certain
level of security from their hotels," Fournier said in a statement.

But instead of security, Fournier said she found susceptibility.

According to a release that Allred sent out, a man approached Fournier the
night of the incident, expressing a sexual interest in her. According to
Allred, Fournier had made it very clear that she was not interested in him and
retreated to her room to get away.

That same man, according to the suit, later went to the front desk, said that
he was Fournier's husband, and obtained a key from hotel staff to her room.

The staff did not ask him for any identification or proof that he was in fact
Fournier's husband, according to the lawsuit. He then proceeded to her room and
tried to molest her. She awoke, grabbed a housecoat, and ran screaming from the
room.

"To this day, I still suffer from the memories of that night and I am still not
able to put it behind me," Fournier said.

She said that, because of the incident, she left her career and moved from New
York to be closer to her family.

The suit alleges that there is no indication that Starwood has taken any action
to investigate the incident at Hotel Kdmp or to disassociate itself from the
Finnish hotel.

In a statement given to ABC News by Starwoods Hotels and Resorts, Worldwide,
the company said it is investigating the incident.

"The safety and security of our guests is our first and foremost priority. It
is company-wide policy to ensure proper identification is shown and verified
before distributing a key to a registered guest's room," the statement said.
"We are taking this allegation seriously and are working with the hotel in
question to understand the facts and any breach of security that may have
contributed to this very unfortunate event. "

Allred said the case is representative of a bigger problem than a personal
assault, because women, particularly businesswoman, have a right to feel safe
when traveling and staying at well known hotels.

"Business women have a right to safety and security and especially need that
safety and security when traveling abroad," Allred told ABC News. "They are
particualrly vulnerable when traveling alone. Starwood's negligence, misconduct
and reckless disregard for the safety of Ms. Fournier has led to devastating
and life changing consequences for her. ... They need to be fully accountable
and make sure that this never happens again."

Romney Wins New Hampshire, But Ron Paul.s Strong Showing Could Affect The
General Election


By Henry Blodget | Daily Ticker - 1 hour 27 minutes ago

http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/ron-paul-strong-showing-hampshire-c
ould-affect-general-160603525.html

Mitt Romney easily won the New Hampshire GOP primary, as expected. But the
performance of second-place finisher Ron Paul was impressive. According to
political strategists, Paul's strong showing here and in other primaries could
have a significant impact on the general election.

Ron Paul got 23% of the votes in New Hampshire, up from 8% the last time
around.

This performance surprised a lot of people, including Greg Valliere, the Chief
Political Strategist at Potomac Research Group.

Valliere had expected Jon Huntsman to finish second and Paul third.

Ron Paul's performance in the campaign thus far even appears to have surprised
his own advisors. Sources close to the campaign told us that Paul's advisors
weren't expecting him to do this well.

And although mainstream media and voters will likely still dismiss Paul as a
fringe candidate, it's worth thinking about what his surge means and what
impact it will have on the rest of the campaign.

One reason for the surge is presumably that Ron Paul is finally getting his
turn as Not Romney--the fantasy candidate that every Republican voter who finds
Romney either too liberal or too robotic or both. Almost every Republican in
the race has been temporarily embraced as "Not Romney"... and then, just as
quickly, been dumped as voters wake up from their dream and realize the truth
about the candidate they've gotten in bed with.

If Ron Paul's surge is the result of his turn as Not Romney, he'll collapse in
a couple of weeks--the same way Michelle Bachmann, Sarah Palin, Rick Perry,
Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum have all collapsed before him.

Another reason for the Paul surge, however, may be that he is now the only hope
of voters inspired by the original Tea Party message of a few years ago: The
realization that the country is on a completely unsustainable financial path
and that no one in Washington has the balls to really do anything about this.

That's a reasonable concern. And its reasonable for voters to embrace it. And
Ron Paul's willingness to repeatedly blast the Wall Street bailouts and the
country's fiscal denial has earned him lots of support among his fanatical
followers.

Ron Paul's current policies still seem too extreme for him to win the general
election. Instantly chopping $1 trillion of government spending, abolishing the
Fed, ending all foreign military interventions, and so forth, would be highly
aggressive (aggressive, not conservative) changes that could radically alter
both the U.S. economy and the global power-balance. And the more Paul's
candidacy is taken seriously by the mainstream, the more directly he will have
to answer for issues like the offensive and racist newsletters that were once
published under his name.

But if Ron Paul does amass enough delegates, which he appears to be on his way
to doing (especially now that Florida may split delegates), he will get more of
what his advisors appear to believe they wanted from the beginning: Influence.

Why?

Because if Ron Paul decides to run as a third-party candidate, which Greg
Valliere and other analysts consider possible, he could capture enough of the
vote to destroy any chance the GOP has of winning the general election.

A third-party candidate would be a "disaster" for the GOP, Valliere says. Such
a candidate could capture about 7% of the vote and cripple the Republicans'
chances of winning some key states. So what Paul and other possible third-party
candidates do (Valliere includes Sarah Palin as a possibility here) could have
a significant impact on the general election.

Court: Judges cannot get involved in church dispute


By JESSE J. HOLLAND | Associated Press - 15 mins ago
http://news.yahoo.com/court-judges-cannot-involved-church-dispute-152559467.htm
l

WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a groundbreaking case, the Supreme Court on Wednesday
held for the first time that religious employees of a church cannot sue for
employment discrimination.

But the court's unanimous decision in a case from Michigan did not specify the
distinction between a secular employee, who can take advantage of the
government's protection from discrimination and retaliation, and a religious
employee, who can't.

It was, nevertheless, the first time the high court has acknowledged the
existence of a "ministerial exception" to anti-discrimination laws -- a
doctrine developed in lower court rulings. This doctrine says the First
Amendment's guarantee of freedom of religion shields churches and their
operations from the reach of such protective laws when the issue involves
employees of these institutions.

The case came before the court because the federal Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission sued the Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School of
Redford, Mich., on behalf of employee Cheryl Perich, over her firing, which
happened after she complained of discrimination under the Americans with
Disabilities Act.

Writing the court's opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said allowing
anti-discrimination lawsuits against religious organizations could end up
forcing churches to take religious leaders they no longer want.

"Such action interferes with the internal governance of the church, depriving
the church of control over the selection of those who will personify its
beliefs," Roberts said. "By imposing an unwanted minister, the state infringes
the Free Exercise Clause, which protects a religious group's right to shape its
own faith and mission through its appointments."

The court's decision will make it virtually impossible for ministers to take on
their employers for being fired for complaining about issues like sexual
harassment, said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans
United.

"Clergy who are fired for reasons unrelated to matters of theology -- no matter
how capricious or venal those reasons may be -- have just had the courthouse
door slammed in their faces," Lynn said.

But Douglass Laycock, who argued the case for Hosanna-Tabor, called it a "huge
win for religious liberty."

"The court has unanimously confirmed the right of churches to select their own
ministers and religious leaders," he said.

But since this was the first time the high court has ever considered the
"ministerial exception," it would not set hard and fast rules on who can be
considered a religious employee of a religious organization, Roberts said.

"We are reluctant ... to adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee
qualifies as a minister," he said. "It is enough for us to conclude, in this,
our first case involving the ministerial exception, that the exception covers
Perich, given all the circumstances of her employment."

Perich was promoted from a temporary lay teacher to a "called" teacher in 2000
by a vote of the church's congregation and was hired as a commissioned
minister. She taught secular classes as well as a religious class four days a
week. She also occasionally led chapel service.

She got sick in 2004 but tried to return to work from disability leave despite
being diagnosed with narcolepsy. The school said she couldn't return because
they had hired a substitute for that year. They fired her and removed her from
the church ministry after she showed up at the school and threatened to sue to
get her job back.

Perich complained to the EEOC, which sued the church for violations of the
disabilities act.

A federal judge threw out the lawsuit on grounds that Perich fell under the
ADA's ministerial exception, which keeps the government from interfering with
church affairs. But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated her
lawsuit, saying Perich's "primary function was teaching secular subjects" so
the ministerial exception didn't apply.

The federal appeals court's reasoning was wrong, Roberts said. He said that
Perich had been ordained as a minister and the lower court put too much weight
on the fact that regular teachers also performed the same religious duties as
she did.

The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also placed too much emphasis on the fact
that Perich's religious duties only took up 45 minutes of her workday, while
secular duties consumed the rest, Roberts said.

"The issue before us ... is not one that can be resolved by a stopwatch," he
said.

The court's decision was a narrow one, with Roberts refusing to extend the
ministerial exception to other types of lawsuits that religious employees might
bring against their employers. "We express no view on whether the exception
bars other types of suits, including actions by employees alleging breach of
contract or tortious conduct by their religious employers," Roberts said.

Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote a separate opinion, argued that the exception
should be tailored for only an employee "who leads a religious organization,
conducts worship services or important religious ceremonies or rituals or
serves as a messenger or teacher of its faith."

But "while a purely secular teacher would not qualify for the 'ministerial
exception,' the constitutional protection of religious teachers is not somehow
diminished when they take on secular functions in addition to their religious
ones," Alito said.

SOPA Is Dead: Smith Pulls Bill

SOPA Sponsor Withdraws Bill From House

12 minutes ago by Todd Wasserman

http://mashable.com/2012/01/20/sopa-is-dead-smith-pulls-bill/

Lamar Smith, the chief sponsor of SOPA, said on Friday that he is pulling the
bill "until there is wider agreement on a solution."

"I have heard from the critics and I take seriously their concerns regarding
proposed legislation to address the problem of online piracy," Smith (R-Texas)
told Reuters. "It is clear that we need to revisit the approach on how best to
address the problem of foreign thieves that steal and sell American inventions
and products."

Smith also released the following statement on Friday: "We need to revisit the
approach on how best to address the problem of foreign thieves that steal and
sell American inventions and products. "The problem of online piracy is too big
to ignore. American intellectual property industries provide 19 million
high-paying jobs and account for more than 60% of U.S. exports. The theft of
America's intellectual property costs the U.S. economy more than $100 billion
annually and results in the loss of thousands of American jobs. Congress cannot
stand by and do nothing while American innovators and job creators are under
attack."

"The online theft of American intellectual property is no different than the
theft of products from a store. It is illegal and the law should be enforced
both in the store and online.

"The Committee will continue work with copyright owners, Internet companies,
financial institutions to develop proposals that combat online piracy and
protect America's intellectual property. We welcome input from all
organizations and individuals who have an honest difference of opinion about
how best to address this widespread problem. The Committee remains committed to
finding a solution to the problem of online piracy that protects American
intellectual property and innovation."

The move comes after widespread protest on the Internet on Wednesday by
Wikipedia, Reddit and others. The sites signaled their displeasure with the
bill by going dark. That day, several Congressmen dropped their support for
SOPA and its Senate counterpart, PIPA. The latter bill has also been taken off
the table for now.

"In light of recent events, I have decided to postpone Tuesday's vote on the
PROTECT IP Act," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) in a statement
Friday morning.

Smith's stance comes just two days after he told The Wall Street Journal that
he didn't plan to back down on SOPA, telling the newspaper he expected to "move
forward" with the bill in February.

The Race Is Still Romney's

By Reid Wilson | National Journal - Fri, Jan 20, 2012

http://news.yahoo.com/race-still-romneys-121221965.html

The fundamentals of Mitt Romney's presidential campaign are strong. Even in the
wake of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's surging momentum in South
Carolina, the fact remains that Romney is the overwhelming front-runner for the
Republican nomination -- and Saturday's primary won't do anything to change
that.

That's not to poo-poo Gingrich's comeback. The former speaker's recovery in
South Carolina has come against all odds, including sustained attacks from a
pro-Romney super PAC, a damaging tell-all interview from his second wife, a
sustained push by social conservatives to unite behind Rick Santorum, and the
fact that Gingrich is still running a campaign virtually bereft of the
infrastructure that past serious candidates have needed to win key primary
states.

Gingrich's roller-coaster ride in public-opinion polls began its initial climb
thanks to strong performances in debates in November. His revival, after a
barrage of attack ads in Iowa, came thanks to two more strong performances this
week and his wise decision to abandon a high-road strategy that has never been
rewarded in presidential politics in favor of mixing it up with front-running
Romney.

But Gingrich is living a hand-to-mouth existence, while Romney has sowed seeds
he can reap later on in other states. The Republican presidential campaign is,
at the end, a race for 1,144 delegates, and the former Massachusetts governor's
campaign is in a far better position to harvest those delegates in later
primaries.

So far, Romney has collected an estimated 14 delegates, thanks to his
performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, while Gingrich has just two. South
Carolina will award 28 delegates, likely split between the four remaining
candidates. The first real delegate prize comes on Jan. 31, when the winner of
the Florida primary collects all 50 of the state's delegates.

Gingrich campaigned in Florida briefly last week. Romney has competed in
Florida before, and a super PAC that backs his campaign is helping to give him
a jump. Reports filed with the Federal Election Commission show Restore Our
Future, the pro-Romney super PAC, spent about $300,000 on mailings and $1.5
million on television in Florida this week alone; the filings suggest the
television time is dedicated to negative ads focused on Gingrich.

Gingrich gets his chance to share the stage with Romney twice, first on Monday
at a debate cosponsored by National Journal, NBC News, and the Tampa Bay Times
and then again on Thursday at a CNN/Republican Party of Florida debate in
Jacksonville. He will have to hope that once again, strong debate performances
will overcome the rush of negative advertisements that has already begun.

After Florida, Gingrich's outlook becomes even more bleak. The February
calendar presents Romney with the opportunity to do to Gingrich what Barack
Obama did to Hillary Clinton in 2008. Caucuses in Nevada, Colorado, and
Minnesota will benefit a more organized campaign, giving Romney and Rep. Ron
Paul a boost over Gingrich. The two primaries that month, in Arizona and
Michigan, will take place on Romney-friendly turf; Arizona has a sizable Mormon
electorate, while Michigan is Romney's home state. By the end of February,
Romney is likely to have the majority of the 274 delegates awarded to that
point. Paul's focus on caucus states means Gingrich may not even be in second
place by the end of the month.

Then comes Super Tuesday, when 10 states will allocate a total of 407
delegates. With few debates left on the horizon, Gingrich won't have the time,
the exposure, or the money to build the type of national campaign Romney has
already started to build (Gingrich isn't even eligible for the 46 delegates
from Virginia; his campaign didn't submit enough valid signatures to make the
ballot there).

In short, South Carolina presents Gingrich's last real chance to be on equal
footing with Romney before the race goes national. Barring a sustained surge in
campaign contributions for Gingrich and a real stumble by Romney's campaign,
the reality is that the race for the Republican nod is as clear today as it was
before Gingrich's revitalization: There will be no extended fight for delegates
a la Obama-Clinton, there will be no brokered convention, and Romney will be
the Republican nominee. The deck is stacked too much in Romney's favor to give
Gingrich's campaign anything more than a temporary reprieve.

Religious employers must cover pill, Feds say
Nonprofits will have one additional year to comply with birth control
requirement

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR Associated Press
12:01 a.m., Jan. 21, 2012

WASHINGTON -- Many church-affiliated institutions will have to cover free birth
control for employees, the Obama administration announced Friday in an
election-year move that outraged religious groups, fueling a national debate
about the reach of government.
In a concession, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said
nonprofit institutions such as church-affiliated hospitals, colleges and social
service agencies will have one additional year to comply with the requirement,
issued in regulations under President Barack Obama's health care overhaul.
"I believe this proposal strikes the appropriate balance between respecting
religious freedom and increasing access to important preventive services,"
Sebelius said in a statement.
However, the concession wasn't likely to stop a determined effort by opponents
to block or overturn the rule. If they fail, some predicted religious employers
would drop coverage for their workers, opting instead to pay fines to the
federal government under the health care law.
"Never before has the federal government forced individuals and organizations
to go out into the marketplace and buy a product that violates their
conscience," said New York Cardinal-designate Timothy Dolan, president of the
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. "This shouldn't happen in a land where
free exercise of religion ranks first in the Bill of Rights."
Officials said the administration's ruling was carefully considered, after
reviewing more than 200,000 comments from interested parties and the public.
The one-year extension, they said, responds to concerns raised by religious
employers about making adjustments. Administration officials stressed
individual decisions about whether or not to use birth control, and what kind,
remain in the hands of women and their doctors.
Underscoring the sensitivity of the decision, Obama personally spoke with Dolan
on Friday to inform him of the announcement, an administration official said.
Many religious conservatives consider the morning-after birth control pill to
be an abortion drug.

Court says it will have more to say about high-tech surveillance methods

January 24, 2012 7:17 AM

http://www.wwmt.com/articles/surveillance-1400917-tech-police.html

WASHINGTON (AP) - Police surveillance may be getting more high-tech -- but that
doesn't mean police don't sometimes need a good, old-fashioned warrant.

A unanimous Supreme Court ruling today will prevent police from installing GPS
technology to track suspects without first getting the approval of a judge.

And the justices made it clear that they will have more to say about the use of
technology to keep tabs on Americans.

The outcome is an unusual setback for government and police agencies who've
become used to getting some leeway in their investigations in post-9/11
America.

The case involved a Washington, D.C., nightclub owner. Police installed a GPS
device in his jeep, and tracked him for four weeks. The tracking helped to link
him to a home that was used to stash money and drugs. He was sentenced to life
in prison, but an appeals court overturned the conviction.

Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the use of the device constituted a search,
meaning a warrant was required.

Law professor Donald Tibbs of Drexel University says the ruling "sends a
message that technological advances cannot outpace the American Constitution."

Romney will get Secret Service protection now. He will be the only candidate to
have it unless someone decides Newt needs it too.

'Soul Train' Host Don Cornelius Dead Of Suicide

By Associated Press | Stop The Presses! - 35 minutes ago

http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/soul-train-don-cornelius-dead-75-
apparent-suicide-152756913.html

LOS ANGELES (AP) . Don Cornelius, creator of the long-running TV dance show
"Soul Train," shot himself to death Wednesday morning at his Los Angeles home,
police said. He was 75.

Officers responding to a report of a shooting found Cornelius at his Mulholland
Drive home at around 4 a.m., police said. He was pronounced dead of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound at 4:56 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said
Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter.

"Soul Train" began in 1970 in Chicago on WCIU-TV as a local program and aired
nationally from 1971 to 2006.

It introduced television audiences to such legendary artists as Aretha
Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Barry White and brought the best R&B, soul and later
hip-hop acts to TV and had teenagers dance to them. It was one of the first
shows to showcase African-Americans prominently, although the dance group was
racially mixed. Cornelius was the first host and executive producer.

"There was not programming that targeted any particular ethnicity," he said in
2006, then added: "I'm trying to use euphemisms here, trying to avoid saying
there was no television for black folks, which they knew was for them."

Cornelius, who was inducted into the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame in
1995 and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, said in 2006 he remained
grateful to the musicians who made "Soul Train" the destination for the best
and latest in black music.

"I figured as long as the music stayed hot and important and good, that there
would always be a reason for 'Soul Train,'" Cornelius said.

The series spawned a franchise that includes the Soul Train Music Awards, the
Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards and the Soul Train Christmas Starfest.

Cornelius stepped down as "Soul Train" host in 1993.

In his later years, Cornelius had a troubled marriage. In 2009, he was
sentenced to three years' probation after pleading no contest to misdemeanor
spousal battery. In his divorce case that year, he also mentioned having
significant health issues.

Facebook wants to raise $5 billion in historic IPO

By Charley Blaine, MSN Money on Wed, Feb 1, 2012 12:28 PM

The offering would be larger than Google's 2004 IPO. The company has 845
million users and generated nearly $4 billion in revenue in 2011. The offering
is expected to be completed in May.
By Charley Blaine on Wed, Feb 1, 2012 12:28 PM
Updated: 6:08 p.m. ET.

Social-networking site Facebook filed for its long-awaited initial public
offering today.

The company said it wants to raise $5 billion in common shares in the offering,
but its size could be increased. The offering statement confirms that CEO Mark
Zuckerberg is one of the nation's richest people already. His stake in the
company was valued at $15.9 billion at the end of 2011.

Facebook, incorporated in 2004, had $3.7 billion in revenue in 2011 and $1
billion in net income. It says it has 485 million in active users, who upload
250 million photographs a day and log 2.7 billion likes and dislikes every day.
The users have 100 billion friendships.

Facebook's IPO is the most eagerly awaited since Google (GOOG +0.12%) went
public in 2004. The interest in the IPO was so great that it crashed the
Securities and Exchange Commissions Web site late today.

Eighty-five percent of Facebook's revenue in 2011 came from advertising. That's
down from 98% in 2009 and 95% in 2010. The rest of the revenue comes from a
payments derived from virtual goods used in social games.

The company sees the payments business as a substantial opportunity.

The offering will be Class A common shares, which come with 1 vote per share.
The company's Class B shares get 10 votes each. Zuckerberg owns about 30% of
the Class B shares and has effective control of the company, the statement
says.

The proposed offering is smaller that the $10 billion that was expected as late
as last week.

The smaller deal size reflects a decision to start with a conservative base and
gauge demand for the shares before deciding whether to increase the size of the
offering, International Financing Review said Wednesday.

The filing timetable appears to establish a framework for Facebook to finalize
the IPO process by May, pending a smooth registration process with the SEC. One
reason to get the offering done by May, according to CNBC's Julia Boorstin: It
lets insiders, normally not allowed to sell shares before six months, sell by
the end of the year, before capital gains rates rise.

The networking site has opted to hire five lead investment banks, known as
bookrunners, to handle the offering, featuring Morgan Stanley in the coveted
lead role.

Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and JP Morgan
round out the initial list of bookrunners on the deal, though the syndicate
could also grow, IFR said.

Investment banks commit to buy the shares and market them to prospective
investors.

Recent trading in Facebook stock on private exchanges has pointed to an $80
billion-plus valuation, IFR said.

Facebooks biggest outside stakeholder is venture firm Accel Partners, which
first led a $12.7 million investment in 2005. Other investors include Microsoft
Corp. and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel as well as Greylock Partners.

As the sites popularity grew, banks, hedge funds and mutual fund companies
started buying stock. In January 2011, Facebook said it raised $1.5 billion in
a financing round led by Goldman Sachs that valued the company at $50 billion.

Goldman Sachs, funds managed by the firm, and Digital Sky Technologies bought
$500 million of stock, while Goldman Sachs offered $1 billion of shares to
non-U.S. clients.

Angelo Dundee dead at 90

By TIM DAHLBERG, AP Boxing Writer  36 mins ago

Angelo Dundee, the brilliant motivator who worked the corner for Muhammad Ali
in his greatest fights and willed Sugar Ray Leonard to victory in his biggest
bout, died Wednesday in Tampa, Fla. He was 90.

The genial Dundee was best known for being in Ali's corner for almost his
entire career, but those in boxing also knew him as an ambassador for boxing
and a figure of integrity in a sport that often lacked it.

He died with his family surrounding him, said son, Jimmy Dundee, but not before
being able to attend Ali's 70th birthday bash in Louisville, Ky., last month.

"It was the way he wanted to go," Jimmy Dundee said. "He did everything he
wanted to do."

Micron CEO Steve Appleton dies in plane crash

By Julianne Pepitone @CNNMoneyTech February 3, 2012: 3:58 PM ET


Micron CEO Steve Appleton

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Micron CEO and chairman Steve Appleton died Friday
morning in a small-plane crash in Boise.
Micron, a maker of semiconductors and flash memory, confirmed Appleton's death
at age 51 in a press release that praised his "passion and energy."
Appleton was flying a Lancair fixed-wing single-engine plane that crashed at
8:58 a.m. local time at Boise Airport, a spokeswoman for the airport told CNN's
John Fricke. She could not confirm whether the accident took place at takeoff,
landing or during flight.
Shares of Micron (MU, Fortune 500), which trade on the Nasdaq, were halted on
the news.
Appleton survived a previous crash in July 2004, when the stunt plane he was
flying went down over an Idaho desert.
Appleton joined Micron in 1983 and held several positions at the Boise-based
company. He was named president and chief operating officer in 1991, and he
became chairman, CEO and president in 1994. In 2007, he shed the president
portion of his title.
Appleton was known for his love of planes and for his athleticism. He held a
tennis scholarship at Boise State while working towards his business
administration degree. After that, he played pro-tennis on the satellite
circuit for six months before diving into his career at Micron Technology.
Micron Technology in the Fortune 500
Appleton "learned to play [tennis] left-handed after breaking his right wrist,"
according to the book Winner Take All by Richard J. Elkus.
Appleton sat on the board of the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), and
the trade group awarded him its highest honor this past November.
"Steve was a visionary and a true leader in our industry. He will be deeply
missed..." SIA president Brian Toohey said in a prepared statement.
Micron's press release offered condolences to Appleton's wife, Dalynn, as well
as their children.
Micron was founded in Boise in October 1978, and it became a public company in
June 1984. The company ranked No. 287 on the 2011 Fortune 500 list. At the end
of 2011, Micron employed about 20,000 full-time staffers.
Friday's accident marks the second small-plane crash in two months that killed
high-profile executives. In late December, a plane carrying two Greenhill & Co.
(GHL) bankers, the wife of one of the bankers and their two children crashed on
a New Jersey highway, killing all five aboard.B

NRC Approves First New Nuclear Plant In Three Decades
Posted: Feb 9, 2012 2:57 PM

WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's first new nuclear power plant in a generation
won approval Thursday as federal regulators voted to grant a license for two
new reactors in Georgia.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted 4-1 to approve Atlanta-based Southern
Co.'s request to build two nuclear reactors at its Vogtle site south of
Augusta.

The vote clears the way for officials to issue an operating license for the
reactors, which could begin operating as soon as 2016 and 2017.

The NRC last approved construction of a nuclear plant in 1978, a year before a
partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania raised
fears of a radiation release and brought new reactor orders nearly to a halt.

NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko voted against the Vogtle license, saying he wanted
a binding commitment from the company that it would make safety changes
prompted by the March 2011 nuclear disaster in Japan.

"We've given them a license. They have not given us any commitment they will
make these changes in the future," Jaczko said.

The meltdown at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant led to a series of recommendations
by the NRC to improve safety at the 104 commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S.
The changes are intended to make the plants better prepared for incidents they
were not initially designed to handle, such as prolonged power blackouts or
damage to multiple reactors at the same time.

The changes are still being developed, though Jaczko said it is clear that they
will be required by the NRC before the new reactors open in 2016 or 2017.

Despite his opposition to the license, Jaczko called the vote "historic" and a
culmination of years of work by Southern Co. and the NRC.

Southern Company Chairman and CEO Thomas A. Fanning called the NRC vote "a
monumental accomplishment for Southern Company, Georgia Power, our partners and
the nuclear industry."

Fanning said the company was "committed to bringing these units online to
deliver clean, safe and reliable energy to our customers."

"The project is on track, and our targets related to cost and schedule are
achievable," Fanning said.

Marvin Fertel, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry lobbying
group, said the NRC vote "sounds a clarion call to the world that the United
States recognizes the importance of expanding nuclear energy as a key component
of a low-carbon energy future that is central to job creation, diversity of
electricity supply and energy security."

Allison Fisher, an energy expert for the consumer advocacy group Public
Citizen, called the NRC's action - less than a year after the Japan crisis - a
step in the wrong direction.

"It is inexplicable that we've chosen this moment in history to expand the use
of a failed and dangerous technology," she said.

While other countries such as Germany are reversing their commitment to nuclear
power, "the U.S. is approving new reactors before the full suite of lessons
from Japan has been learned and before new safety regulations that were
recommended by a task force established after the meltdown crisis at Fukushima
have been implemented," Fisher said.

The NRC approved a new reactor design for the Vogtle plant in December. Utility
companies in Florida and the Carolinas also plan new reactors that use the same
design by Westinghouse Electric Co.

The planned reactors are remnants of a once-anticipated building boom that the
power industry dubbed the "nuclear renaissance."

President Barack Obama has offered the Vogtle project $8.3 billion in federal
loan guarantees as part of its pledge to expand nuclear power.

Obama and other proponents say greater use of nuclear power could cut the
nation's reliance on fossil fuels and create energy without producing emissions
blamed for global warming. A new government permit process strongly encourages
utilities to use pre-approved reactor designs rather than building custom
models, a strategy intended to make construction easier and less expensive.

The once hoped-for boom has been plagued by a series of problems, from the
prolonged economic downturn to the sharp drop in the price of natural gas, due
in part to improved drilling techniques that have allowed energy companies to
tap previously unavailable underground shale formations.

The Vogtle project is considered by many observers to be a major test of
whether the industry can build nuclear plants without the delays and cost
overruns that plagued earlier rounds of building decades ago.

Close on the project's heels is South Carolina Electric & Gas Co., which is
seeking permission to build two reactors at an existing plant in Jenkinsville,
S.C.

BODY: 
from the AP News Wire>

Whitney Houston, who reigned as pop music's queen until her majestic voice and
regal image were ravaged by drug use, erratic behavior and a tumultuous
marriage to singer Bobby Brown, has died. She was 48.

Publicist Kristen Foster said Saturday that the singer had died, but the cause
and the location of her death were unknown.

At her peak, Houston the golden girl of the music industry. From the middle
1980s to the late 1990s, she was one of the world's best-selling artists. She
wowed audiences with effortless, powerful, and peerless vocals that were rooted
in the black church but made palatable to the masses with a pop sheen.

Her success carried her beyond music to movies, where she starred in hits like
"The Bodyguard" and "Waiting to Exhale."

She had the he perfect voice, and the perfect image: a gorgeous singer who had
sex appeal but was never overtly sexual, who maintained perfect poise.

She influenced a generation of younger singers, from Christina Aguilera to
Mariah Carey, who when she first came out sounded so much like Houston that
many thought it was Houston.

But by the end of her career, Houston became a stunning cautionary tale of the
toll of drug use. Her album sales plummeted and the hits stopped coming; her
once serene image was shattered by a wild demeanor and bizarre public
appearances. She confessed to abusing cocaine, marijuana and pills, and her
once pristine voice became raspy and hoarse, unable to hit the high notes as
she had during her prime.

"The biggest devil is me. I'm either my best friend or my worst enemy," Houston
told ABC's Diane Sawyer in an infamous 2002 interview with then-husband Brown
by her side.

It was a tragic fall for a superstar who was one of the top-selling artists in
pop music history, with more than 55 million records sold in the United States
alone.

She seemed to be born into greatness. She was the daughter of gospel singer
Cissy Houston, the cousin of 1960s pop diva Dionne Warwick and the goddaughter
of Aretha Franklin.

Houston first started singing in the church as a child. In her teens, she sang
backup for Chaka Khan, Jermaine Jackson and others, in addition to modeling. It
was around that time when music mogul Clive Davis first heard Houston perform.

"The time that I first saw her singing in her mother's act in a club ... it was
such a stunning impact," Davis told "Good Morning America."

"To hear this young girl breathe such fire into this song. I mean, it really
sent the proverbial tingles up my spine," he added.

Before long, the rest of the country would feel it, too. Houston made her album
debut in 1985 with "Whitney Houston," which sold millions and spawned hit after
hit. "Saving All My Love for You" brought her her first Grammy, for best female
pop vocal. "How Will I Know," "You Give Good Love" and "The Greatest Love of
All" also became hit singles.

Another multiplatinum album, "Whitney," came out in 1987 and included hits like
"Where Do Broken Hearts Go" and "I Wanna Dance With Somebody."

The New York Times wrote that Houston "possesses one of her generation's most
powerful gospel-trained voices, but she eschews many of the churchier
mannerisms of her forerunners. She uses ornamental gospel phrasing only
sparingly, and instead of projecting an earthy, tearful vulnerability,
communicates cool self-assurance and strength, building pop ballads to
majestic, sustained peaks of intensity."

Her decision not to follow the more soulful inflections of singers like
Franklin drew criticism by some who saw her as playing down her black roots to
go pop and reach white audiences. The criticism would become a constant refrain
through much of her career. She was even booed during the "Soul Train Awards"
in 1989.

"Sometimes it gets down to that, you know?" she told Katie Couric in 1996.
"You're not black enough for them. I don't know. You're not R&B enough. You're
very pop. The white audience has taken you away from them."

Some saw her 1992 marriage to former New Edition member and soul crooner Bobby
Brown as an attempt to refute those critics. It seemed to be an odd union; she
was seen as pop's pure princess while he had a bad-boy image, and already had
children of his own. (The couple had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina, in 1993.) Over
the years, he would be arrested several times, on charges ranging from DUI to
failure to pay child support.

But Houston said their true personalities were not as far apart as people may
have believed.

"When you love, you love. I mean, do you stop loving somebody because you have
different images? You know, Bobby and I basically come from the same place,"
she told Rolling Stone in 1993. "You see somebody, and you deal with their
image, that's their image. It's part of them, it's not the whole picture. I am
not always in a sequined gown. I am nobody's angel. I can get down and dirty. I
can get raunchy."

It would take several years, however, for the public to see that side of
Houston. Her moving 1991 rendition of "The Star Spangled Banner" at the Super
Bowl, amid the first Gulf War, set a new standard and once again reaffirmed her
as America's sweetheart.

In 1992, she became a star in the acting world with "The Bodyguard." Despite
mixed reviews, the story of a singer (Houston) guarded by a former Secret
Service agent (Kevin Costner) was an international success.

It also gave her perhaps her most memorable hit: a searing, stunning rendition
of Dolly Parton's "I Will Always Love You," which sat atop the charts for
weeks. It was Grammy's record of the year and best female pop vocal, and the
"Bodyguard" soundtrack was named album of the year.

She returned to the big screen in 1995-96 with "Waiting to Exhale" and "The
Preacher's Wife." Both spawned soundtrack albums, and another hit studio album,
"My Love Is Your Love," in 1998, brought her a Grammy for best female R&B vocal
for the cut "It's Not Right But It's Okay."

But during these career and personal highs, Houston was using drugs. In an
interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2010, she said by the time "The Preacher's
Wife" was released, "(doing drugs) was an everyday thing. ... I would do my
work, but after I did my work, for a whole year or two, it was every day. ... I
wasn't happy by that point in time. I was losing myself."

In the interview, Houston blamed her rocky marriage to Brown, which included a
charge of domestic abuse against Brown in 1993. They divorced in 2007.

Houston would go to rehab twice before she would declare herself drug-free to
Winfrey in 2010. But in the interim, there were missed concert dates, a stop at
an airport due to drugs, and public meltdowns.

She was so startlingly thin during a 2001 Michael Jackson tribute concert that
rumors spread she had died the next day. Her crude behavior and jittery
appearance on Brown's reality show, "Being Bobby Brown," was an example of her
sad decline. Her Sawyer interview, where she declared "crack is whack," was
often parodied. She dropped out of the spotlight for a few years.

Houston staged what seemed to be a successful comeback with the 2009 album "I
Look To You." The album debuted on the top of the charts, and would eventually
go platinum.

Things soon fell apart. A concert to promote the album on "Good Morning
America" went awry as Houston's voice sounded ragged and off-key. She blamed an
interview with Winfrey for straining her voice.

A world tour launched overseas, however, only confirmed suspicions that Houston
had lost her treasured gift, as she failed to hit notes and left many fans
unimpressed; some walked out. Canceled concert dates raised speculation that
she may have been abusing drugs, but she denied those claims and said she was
in great shape, blaming illness for cancellations.

AT&T Relents on "Unlimited Data" Plan Limits

NEW YORK (AP) - AT&T Inc. caved to complaints that it's placing unreasonable
limits on the "unlimited data" plans it offers smartphone subscribers.

The cellphone company said on Thursday that from now on, it will only slow down
service for its "unlimited data" subscribers when they hit 3 gigabytes of usage
within a billing cycle.

Previously, the company had been slowing down service when subscribers entered
the heaviest 5 percent of data users for that month and that area.

There was no way for subscribers to find out ahead of time what the limit was.
AT&T would send a warning by text message to people who approached the limit.
The data throttling would then kick in a few days later. Thousands of
subscribers complained about the policy online.

"Our unlimited plan customers have told us they want more clarity around how
the program works and what they can expect," AT&T said in a statement Thursday.

An Associated Press story two weeks ago cited subscribers whose data service
had been throttled at just over 2 gigabytes of data use. The story included
others who had received warnings that throttling was imminent. The 2 gigabyte
barrier was lower than AT&T's current "limited" plan provides. One person said
his phone was practically useless for two weeks out the month because the data
service was slowed so drastically.

AT&T doesn't sell the "unlimited data" plan any more, but subscribers have been
allowed to keep it. The company charges $30 per month for the plan, the same
amount it charges for 3 gigabytes of data on a new "tiered" or limited plan.

AT&T has about 17 million "unlimited" smartphone subscribers, most of whom use
iPhones.

AT&T's reversal comes less than a week after iPhone user Matt Spaccarelli won a
small claims lawsuit against the company for slowing down his service. A Simi
Valley, Calif. judge awarded Spaccarelli $850, agreeing that "unlimited"
service shouldn't be subject to slowdowns. AT&T argued that it never guaranteed
the speed of the service, just that it would provide unlimited downloads. The
company said it will appeal the decision. It bars subscribers from bringing
class action suits.

As part of the new policy, the Dallas-based phone company said subscribers with
"unlimited" plans and smartphones capable of using the new "LTE" data network
would see the slowdown at 5 gigabytes rather than three. The LTE network is
faster and doesn't have many users yet.

T-Mobile USA is already up front about the usage levels where throttling kicks
in for its data plans. Verizon Wireless has a "5 percent" formula similar to
AT&T's, but doesn't throttle unless the particular cell tower a heavy user is
communicating with is congested at that moment. By contrast, AT&T and T-Mobile
throttle speeds for the rest of the billing cycle, regardless of local
conditions. Verizon's policy has drawn few complaints.

Alone among the Big Four national wireless carriers, Sprint has an unlimited
data plan that isn't subject to throttling. However, it reserves the right to
cancel service for those who use excessive amounts of data.

In a similar incident last fall, Verizon abandoned a planned fee for settling
phone bills through last-minute credit-card payments after customers
complained.

Utah Woman Gives Birth to Third Leap Day Baby

PROVO, Utah (AP) - In one of the rarest feats in the annals of family planning,
a Utah woman has given birth on a third consecutive Leap Day and tied a record
set in the 1960s in Norway.

David and Louise Estes' daughter Jade was born Wednesday morning in Provo, an
hour south of Salt Lake City, four years after their son Remington was born on
Feb. 29, 2008, and eight years after their son Xavier was born Feb. 29, 2004.

Baby Jade was already five days overdue when doctors induced labor and the
family hit the elusive date.

"I have never gone over so I wasn't sure if she was going to wait," Louise told
The Daily Herald of Provo. "As soon as we passed midnight I knew it really,
really could happen."

Leap Days come once every four years to recalibrate the calendar and account
for the 365 days and 6 hours it takes Earth to revolve around the sun. Having a
Feb. 29 birthday can be both a blessing and a curse - a "Leapling" can only
celebrate their true birthday once every four years. But they also joke that
they age four times slower.

"We're gonna try to get our oldest a car on his fourth birthday," Louise joked
in an interview with KSL in Salt Lake City.

The Estes family, which has two other children who weren't born on the special
date, says they try to have a large celebration around the end of February and
beginning of March each non-Leap Year, in place of the missing birthdate.

This year, Remington and Xavier got their own special birthday cakes and
celebrations.

"We always make sure to celebrate their fourth and eighth birthdays in a big
way," Louise said. "It is a milestone for everyone."

Louise Estes said their 8-year-old son Xavier's Feb. 29 birthday was pure
coincidence. But they were a bit more intentional with Leaplings No. 2 and 3.

"I approached her in October of 2010 and said 'If we are going to have another
baby this would be really cool,' " David told the Daily Herald. "I wanted to
give her time to think about it."

Louise became pregnant, but when doctors pegged her due date at Feb. 24, it
looked like the masterful family planning scheme was headed for a near-miss.

But the 24th passed. The 25th passed. Louise was ready to be induced by Leap
Day, and the 8-pound, 13-ounce girl was born at 7:16 a.m.

"We did go over by five days, which was not easy, but it's all worth it,"
Louise told KSL.

The only other known case of triple Leap Day babies is the Henriksen family of
Norway, which logged Feb. 29 births in 1960, 1964 and 1968.

As for trying to break the record with a Leap Day baby in 2016?

"Right now the answer is obviously going to be no, but you can't be sure,"
David Estes said. "You never know if in four years we will be talking about it
again."

Indonesia Protesters Rally Against Fuel Price Hike
March 29, 2012

ce-hike/507862

to avoid a budget deficit due to expensive fuel subsidies. (AP Photo)]

Thousands of Indonesian protesters rallied on Thursday against a planned fuel
price hike, ahead of a decision on cutting subsidies which the government says
the nation can't afford.

After previous demonstrations turned violent, around 14,000 police and 8,000
soldiers were deployed at key locations in Jakarta, including parliament house,
the presidential palace and the international airport.

Demonstrations have occurred almost daily in recent weeks ahead of the
parliamentary vote on Friday which is expected to raise the heavily subsidized
fuel price by a third, from Rp 4,500 (49 cents per liter) to Rp 6,000.

The government has said that without hiking the fuel price, rising global oil
prices will push the country's budget deficit above the three percent of GDP
cap stipulated by law.

Rally organizers promised tens of thousands of protesters would take to the
streets on Thursday. By mid-morning some 2,000 had gathered in front of the
presidential palace, all members of hardline Muslim group Hizbut Tahrir.

Men wearing Muslim caps and women in headscarves chanted "Replace, replace this
rubbish system" and carried banners saying "Reject the fuel price hike! Rulers
are liars, wicked and traitors."

"Capitalism and imperialism will only put people in misery as foreigners have
always exploited countries with rich natural resources like Indonesia," said
the group's spokesman Ismail Yusnanto.

The Indonesian Trade Unions Alliance said thousands of its members would also
join demonstrations in the capital.

"We demand that the government not hike the fuel price," union chairwoman
Nining Elitos told AFP. "Everything will become more expensive, which will
create a burden. It just means misery."

The Jakarta Police Traffic Management Center reported that anti-fuel price hike
demonstrations also took place in front of the House of Representatives
building in West Jakarta, where about 500 protesters gathered, at the Hotel
Indonesia Traffic Circle and at the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry in Central
Jakarta.

In Bandung city south of Jakarta, thousands of members of Hizbut Tahrir -- a
prominent religious group in Indonesia which is the world's biggest
Muslim-majority nation -- were already demonstrating by early morning.

Planned mass rallies in the capital fizzled Tuesday, with 22,000 security
personnel overseeing just 3,500 protesters. But almost 10,000 people showed up
in other cities including Medan in Sumatra island and Surabaya in eastern Java.

Some rallies turned violent as hundreds of protesters pelted rocks, petrol
bombs and sticks at police, who fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse
the crowd.

Bluegrass Legend Earl Scruggs Dies At 88 In Tennessee
Posted: Mar 28, 2012 10:39 PM

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - It is impossible to overstate the importance of Earl
Scruggs to American music. A pioneering banjo player who helped create modern
country music, his sound is instantly recognizable and as intrinsically wrapped
in the tapestry of the genre as Johnny Cash's baritone or Hank Williams'
heartbreak.

Scruggs passed away Wednesday morning at 88 of natural causes. The legacy he
helped build with bandleader Bill Monroe, guitarist Lester Flatt and the rest
of the Blue Grass Boys was evident all around Nashville, where he died in an
area hospital. His string-bending, mind-blowing way of picking helped transform
a regional sound into a national passion.

Country music has transcended its regional roots, become a billion-dollar music
and tourist enterprise, and evolved far beyond the classic sound Monroe and The
Blue Grass Boys blasted out over the radio on The Grand Ole Opry on Dec. 8,
1945. But Scruggs had no way of knowing this as he nervously prepared for his
first show with Monroe. The 21-year-old wasn't sure how his new picking style
would go over.

"I'd heard The Grand Ole Opry and there was tremendous excitement for me just
to be on The Grand Ole Opry," Scruggs recalled during a 2010 interview at Ryman
Auditorium, where that "big bang" moment occurred. "I just didn't know if or
how well I'd be accepted because there'd never been anybody to play banjo like
me here. There was Stringbean and Grandpa Jones. Most of them were comedians."

There was nothing jokey about the way Scruggs attacked his "fancy five-string
banjo," as Opry announcer George D. Hayes called it. In a performance broadcast
to much of the country but unfortunately lost to history, he scorched the earth
and instantly changed country music. With Monroe on mandolin and Flatt on
guitar, the pace was electrifying and in some ways the speed and volume he laid
down predicted the power of electric music.

Tut Taylor, a friend of the Scruggs family who heard that first performance on
the radio in his Georgia home, called it an unbelieveably raucous moment "a lot
like some of the rock 'n' roll things they had, you know. But this was a new
sound. It was a pretty sound and a welcome sound."

Scruggs' use of three fingers - in place of the limited clawhammer style once
prevalent - elevated the banjo from a part of the rhythm section - or a even a
comedian's prop - to a lead instrument that was as versatile as the guitar and
far more flashy.

His string-bending and lead runs became known worldwide as "the Scruggs picking
style" and the versatility it allowed has helped popularize the banjo beyond
the traditional bluegrass and country forms. Today the banjo can be found in
almost any genre, largely due to the way he freed its players to experiment and
find new space.

That was exactly what Ralph Stanley had in mind when he first heard Scruggs lay
it down. A legendary banjo player in his own right, Stanley said in a 2011
interview that he was inspired by Scruggs when he first heard him over the
radio after returning home from military service in Germany.

"I wasn't doing any playing," Stanley said. "When I got discharged I began
listening to Bill and Earl was with him. I already had a banjo at that time,
but of course I wanted to do the three-finger roll. I knew Earl was the best,
but I didn't want to sound like him. I wanted to do that style, but I wanted to
sound the way I felt and that's what I tried to do."

Country great Porter Wagoner probably summed up Scruggs' importance best of
all: "I always felt like Earl was to the five-string banjo what Babe Ruth was
to baseball. He is the best there ever was, and the best there ever will be."

News of Scruggs' passing quickly spread around the music world and over
Twitter. Actor and banjo player Steve Martin called Scruggs, with whom he
collaborated in 2001 on"Earl Scruggs and Friends," ''the most important banjo
player who ever lived."

Neil Portnow, president and CEO of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences said in a statement the four-time Grammy winner and lifetime
achievement award recipient "leaves an indelible legacy that will be remembered
for generations to come."

Flowers will be placed on his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday
morning.

Scruggs earned that star when he and Flatt weaved themselves into the fabric of
American culture in the 1950s and '60s.

Flatt and Scruggs teamed as a bluegrass act after leaving Monroe from the late
1940s until breaking up in 1969 in a dispute over whether their music should
experiment or stick to tradition. Flatt died in 1979.

They were best known for their 1949 recording "Foggy Mountain Breakdown,"
played in the 1967 movie "Bonnie and Clyde," and "The Ballad of Jed Clampett"
from "The Beverly Hillbillies," the popular TV series that debuted in 1962.
Jerry Scoggins did the singing.

Their popularity grew, and they even became a focal point of the folk music
revival on college campuses. Scruggs' wife, Louise, was their manager and was
credited with cannily guiding their career as well as boosting interest in
country music.

Later, as rock 'n' roll threatened country music's popularity, Flatt and
Scruggs became symbols of traditional country music.

In the 1982 interview, Scruggs said "Bonnie and Clyde" and "The Beverly
Hillbillies" broadened the scope of bluegrass and country music "more than
anything I can put my finger on. Both were hits in so many countries."

After the breakup with Flatt, Scruggs used three of his sons in The Earl
Scruggs Revue. The group played on bills with rock acts such as Steppenwolf and
James Taylor. Sometimes they played festivals before 40,000 people.

Scruggs will always be remembered for his willingness to innovate, but he
wasn't always accepted for it. In "The Big Book of Bluegrass," Scruggs
discussed the breakup with Flatt and how his need to experiment drove a rift
between them. Later in 1985, he and Flatt were inducted together in the Country
Music Hall of Fame.

"It wasn't a bad feeling toward each other as much as it was that I felt I was
depriving myself of something," Scruggs said. "By that, I mean that I love
bluegrass music, and I still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some
other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I can get a
little bogged down and a little depressed."

In 2005, "Foggy Mountain Breakdown" was selected for the Library of Congress'
National Recording Registry of works of unusual merit. The following year, the
1972 Nitty Gritty Dirt Band's "Will the Circle Be Unbroken," on which Scruggs
was one of many famous guest performers, joined the list, too.

Scruggs had been fairly active in the 2000s, returning to a limited touring
schedule after frail health in the 1990s. In 1996, Scruggs suffered a heart
attack in the recovery room of a hospital shortly after hip-replacement
surgery. He also was hospitalized late last year, but seemed in good health
during a few appearances with his sons in 2010 and 2011, though he had given up
the banjo for the guitar by then.

Born Jan. 6, 1924, in Flint Hill, N.C., Scruggs learned to play banjo at age 4.
He appeared at age 11 on a radio talent scout show. By age 15, he was playing
in bluegrass bands. In 1992, Scruggs was among 13 recipients of a National
Medal of Art.

"I never in my wildest dreams thought of rewards and presentations," he said.
"I appreciate those things, especially this one."

Louise Scruggs, his wife of 57 years, died in 2006. He is survived by two sons,
Gary and Randy. Gary Scruggs said funeral arrangements were incomplete.

Artist Thomas Kinkade dies in California.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Artist Thomas Kinkade, whose brushwork paintings of idyllic
landscapes, cottages and churches have been big sellers for dealers across the
United States, died Friday, a family spokesman said.

Kinkade, 54, died at his home in Los Gatos in the San Francisco Bay Area of
what appeared to be natural causes, David Satterfield said

Kinkade called himself the "Painter of Light," and his sentimental paintings,
with their scenes of country gardens and churches in dewy morning light, were
beloved by middlebrow America but reviled by the art establishment. He claimed
to be the nation's most collected living artist, and his paintings and spin-off
products were said to fetch some $100 million a year in sales, and to be in 10
million homes in the United States.

Santorum Drops Out Of GOP Race

Posted: Apr 10, 2012 2:11 PM
Updated: Apr 10, 2012 2:51 PM

GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) - Bowing to the inevitable, Rick Santorum quit the
presidential campaign Tuesday, clearing the way for Mitt Romney to claim the
Republican nomination.

Santorum, appearing with his wife and family in his home state of Pennsylvania,
told supporters the race for him was over, but the fight to defeat President
Barack Obama would go on.

Santorum made no mention of Romney, and stressed that he'd gone farther than
anyone expected, competing "against all odds."

The delegate totals told the tale of Santorum's demise. Romney has more than
twice as many delegates as Santorum and is on pace to reach the number needed
to clinch the nomination - 1,144 - by early June. Still in the race, but not
considered a factor: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron
Paul.

Fort Worth, Texas Debating Whether to Ban Smokers From the Workforce

http://foxnewsinsider.com/2012/04/18/fort-worth-texas-debating-whether-to-ban-s
mokers-from-the-workforce/

In an unprecedented move, the city of Fort Worth, Texas is debating whether or
not to ban smokers from the workforce. Today on The Five Andrea Tantaros
explained, "That means they wouldn't hire anyone who smoked, no ifs, no ands,
and no buts!"

Tantaros said when she first heard of this story, she immediately thought it
was discrimination, but after thinking about it she realized, "The more
government gets involved in government sponsored health care, the more that
they can tell you what to do about your personal decisions."

Greg Gutfeld, who is a smoker, said, "Fort Worth should be changed to Fort
Worthless. Smokers are American heroes and I'll tell you why. They're like the
people that arrive at a party with the best booze and they leave early because
they pay into Social Security and then they die before everybody else does."

He continued, "By the way these laws are based on emotions not fact. These
second-hand smoke studies are so flawed, they're junk science but nobody cares
because nobody wants to defend a smoker."

However, as Eric Bolling pointed out, "What's not junk science is that
insurance companies do give breaks to companies that are smoke-free. So if it's
cheaper for Fort Worth to hire or go all smokeless, listen I don't begrudge
anybody for smoking - But what would be wrong with maybe charging the smoker,
hire them but then charging ... 10 bucks a month."

So would it be wiser if companies simply charged smokers more money to make up
for possible health costs? Bob Beckel weighed in, "It's ridiculous. I tie in
with Greg here, we're going to die earlier and I smoke ... One out of five
people in America, adults, are smokers. Now Fort Worth is saying they're not
going to hire anybody, they're going to take 20 percent of the potential work
force and say even if you're the most qualified for the job we're not going to
have you. What's that all about? What about the people there who are already
smoking?"

Gutfeld asked, "What would you rather have, a great surgeon who smokes or an
adequate surgeon who doesn't smoke? Of course you want the best surgeon."

Asteroid mining venture backed by James Cameron, Google CEO Larry Page

(AP) WASHINGTON - A group of high-tech tycoons wants to mine nearby
asteroids, hoping to turn science fiction into real profits.

The mega-million dollar plan is to use commercially built robotic
ships to squeeze rocket fuel and valuable minerals like platinum and
gold out of the lifeless rocks that routinely whiz by Earth. One of
the company founders predicts they could have their version of a
space-based gas station up and running by 2020.

The inaugural step, to be achieved in the next 18 to 24 months, would
be launching the first in a series of private telescopes that would
search for rich asteroid targets.

Several scientists not involved in the project said they were
simultaneously thrilled and skeptical, calling the plan daring,
difficult - and highly expensive. They struggle to see how it could be
cost-effective, even with platinum and gold worth nearly $1,600 an
ounce. An upcoming NASA mission to return just 2 ounces (60 grams) of
an asteroid to Earth will cost about $1 billion.

But the entrepreneurs announcing the project Tuesday in Seattle have a
track record of making big money off ventures into space. Company
founders Eric Anderson and Peter Diamandis pioneered the idea of
selling rides into space to tourists and, Diamandis' company offers
"weightless" airplane flights.

Investors and advisers to the new company, Planetary Resources Inc. of
Seattle, include Google CEO Larry Page and Executive Chairman Eric
Schmidt and explorer and filmmaker James Cameron.

from the AP newswire>

Barack Obama marked the first anniversary of the raid that killed Osama bin
Laden with an unannounced visit to Kabul, the culmination of a series of events
aimed at trumpeting in an election year one of his biggest overseas successes.

In contrast with the relatively restrained approach in the days after last
year's killing, the Obama campaign is intent on making the most of the
anniversary. Obama was due to make a televised US nationwide address Tuesday
night from Bagram airport outside Kabul.

The reason for the visit was ostensibly to sign an agreement reached earlier
this month with Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai on relations between the two
countries following the withdrawal of most US and other international forces in
2014.

But Obama administration officials and diplomats based in Kabul also
acknowledged the timing coincided with the anniversary of the raid that killed
Bin Laden. The al-Qaida leader fled Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks for
Pakistan, where he was tracked down by the CIA.

Obama's trip came the day after he and his presumptive Republican presidential
challenger, Mitt Romney, quarrelled over Bin Laden's killing. Republicans
accused Obama of engaging in excessive celebration, including the release of a
seven-minute Democratic video about the Bin Laden raid.

The president's visit was kept under wraps until the last moment on security
grounds, following a series of violent incidents, including a lengthy gun
battle in the heart of Kabul just over two weeks ago.

Obama flew into the Bagram airbase outside the city after dark, before taking a
helicopter to the heavily guarded presidential palace.

Although the evening quiet in the capital was broken by the heavy roar of many
more helicopter flights than usual, as Obama, his team and his military escorts
headed into the city and then back out to Bagram, most people in Kabul will
only hear of the visit when they wake on Wednesday.

Obama's TV address will be in the middle of the night in Afghanistan; US
officials travelling with Obama said the 10-minute broadcast was scheduled so
he could reach prime-time audiences in the US.

As well as marking Bin Laden's death, Obama wanted to highlight the fact that
under his presidency he has not only fulfilled his pledge to end the war in
Iraq but that the withdrawal of most of the US forces from Afghanistan will
have been completed by 2014. The Pentagon said some forces will remain to work
as advisers and help train Afghan forces.

A Pew Research Center poll last month found 60% of Americans wanted the US out
of Afghanistan as quickly as possible.

During the short visit, Obama and Karzai signed a deal in the presidential
palace that sets a framework for the long-term relationship between the two
nations after 2014.

The strategic partnership agreement is ten pages long and pledges a decade of
support, but it sidesteps some of the thorniest questions about the US military
presence.

Both sides agreed to delay difficult decisions on long-term access to military
bases and the status of any US forces that do stay on in Afghanistan. These
issues will be negotiated in a separate deal some time before 2014.

The US will also designate Afghanistan a major non-Nato ally, marking the first
such designation of Obama's presidency, the Reuters news agency quoted unnamed
US officials saying.

Obama said: "Neither Americans nor the Afghan people asked for this war yet for
a decade we've stood together. Today, with the signing of the strategic
partnership agreement, we look forward to a future of peace. Today we're
agreeing to be long term partners."

Negotiations on the deal dragged on for over a year, initially held up by two
demands from Karzai that he said were critical to restoring national
sovereignty: Afghan control of jails and an end to night raids on Afghan homes.
Western officials argued for months that the first demand was not practical and
the second could undermine the military effort, but eventually they agreed to
compromises on both.

Washington and its allies wanted to have the US-Afghan strategic partnership
agreed before a major Nato conference to be held later this month in Chicago
where members of the alliance are expected to pledge long-term help to Kabul
with finances and military training.

Aung San Suu Kyi takes oath at Burmese parliament

National League for Democracy leader and her MPs claim seats after being kept
out by military for nearly 25 years

http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/may/02/aung-san-suu-kyi-oath-parliament/pr
int

Aung San Suu Kyi has entered the Burmese parliament to take the oath of office
and her seat as an elected member, ushering in a historic new political era
after years of oppressive military rule.

The woman who led a nearly quarter of a century struggle for democracy in
Myanmar had originally refused to take an oath to "safeguard" the constitution,
because her National League for Democracy wants the document amended to reduce
the military's dominance of government.

The NLD swept byelections on 1 April but its successful candidates initially
refused to take their seats because of the oath dispute. They backed down on
Monday but stressed they will push to amend the constitution.

Asked as she walked toward the chamber if this marked an important day for
Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi said: "I think only time will tell."

The swearing-in ceremony took place in the capital Naypyitaw, which was built
by the former army junta. With white roses in her hair, Suu Kyi stood along
with several dozen of her party's lawmakers as the speaker of the lower house
asked them to read the oath.

The 66-year-old opposition leader's entry into the legislature cements a risky
detente between the NLD and the government of President Thein Sein. His
government has spearheaded months of unexpected reforms since taking power last
year, including the holding of 1 April byelections.

The NLD has too few seats to wield any real power in the ruling party-dominated
assembly and there are fears the presence of an opposition could simply
legitimise the current regime. But the new MPs are likely to bring a level of
public debate to the legislative body that has never been seen as they prepare
for the next general election in 2015.

The last time Aung San Suu Kyi's party was set to join parliament was 1990,
following a landslide election victory that was swiftly annulled by the army.
The military retained outright power until last year.

Aung San Suu Kyi's personal ascent marks an astonishing reversal of fortune for
a woman who became one of the world's most prominent prisoners of conscience,
held under house arrest for much of the last two decades. When the 1991 Nobel
peace prize winner was finally released in late 2010, just after a vote her
party boycotted that was deemed neither free nor fair, few could have imagined
she would make the leap from democracy advocate to elected official in less
than 18 months.

Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues had initially refused to join parliament
when the latest session began on 23 April because they object to the oath
obliging them to "safeguard the constitution". They want the word "safeguard"
changed to "respect", but on Monday the leader said they would put the issue
aside.

"Politics is an issue of give and take. We are not giving up, we are just
yielding to the aspirations of the people," she said.

The party's failure to take their seats had irked some of Aung San Suu Kyi's
backers, who were eager to see her finally take office.

A couple of dozen MPs from smaller opposition parties also sit in the assembly
but the vast majority of seats are held by the military-backed ruling party and
the army. Changing the constitution require a 75% majority, making it all but
impossible without military approval.

Facebook shares fall again as flotation concerns emerge

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18163687?print=true

Facebook's flotation has run into more controversy amid reports of concerns
about the way advisers disclosed information to investors.

As Facebook shares fell another 9% on Tuesday, regulators said they may review
the disclosure process to see if some investors got favourable access.

The SEC and regulatory body FINRA both said they would look into the matter.

Morgan Stanley, lead underwriter on the flotation, said it was "in compliance
with all applicable regulations".

Reuters and the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook's advisers may have
revised their financial forecasts for the social networking company, but that
only selected investors were told.

Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said "there
are issues that we need to look at".

Richard Ketchum, chief executive of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA), said there were "matters of regulatory concern".

But in a statement, Morgan Stanley spokesman, Pen Pendleton, said the bank had
"followed the same procedures for the Facebook offering that it follows for all
initial public offerings".

Also on Tuesday, a private investor issued a writ against the Nasdaq stock
exchange over technical problems on Friday that disrupted Facebook's first
trading day.

Phillip Goldberg, a Maryland resident, is seeking class-action status on behalf
of all investors who say they lost money because of the technical problems.

Facebook's market debut was delayed by about half an hour, and orders to buy or
sell shares were further disrupted. Mr Goldberg has filed a writ in the
southern district court of New York.

Nasdaq chief executive Robert Greifeld has said that "clearly we had mistakes
in the Facebook listing".

It has all taken the shine off one of the most anticipated flotations in
history.

Facebook shares, launched at $38 each on Friday, fell 11% on Monday and a
further 9% on Tuesday. The shares are now worth $31 each.

It is a remarkable turnaround from recent weeks, when the social network's
share sale was over-subscribed and the eight-year-old firm was valued at
$104bn.


'Sober second thoughts'

Much of the blame for the fall in share price is being pinned on lead
underwriters Morgan Stanley and the Nasdaq exchange itself, with many
commentators saying that the sale was over-priced.

"There must have been some sober second thoughts about this," said Brian
Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research.

Mr Wieser thinks a fair price for such a young company without a proven
business model is about $30.

But some analysts say the fall is of little consequence in the early days.

"Whether [Facebook] is worth $95bn or $100bn, it's immaterial," Jeremy Liew of
investment company Lightspeed Venture Partners told Reuters.

The social networking site has transformed the way in which hundreds of
millions of people around the world communicate. It is also transforming the
way companies advertise to existing and potential customers.

But Facebook's 900 million users helped the company generate just $1bn in
profit last year, and there are concerns about its ability to grow profits in
the future.

Indonesia cuts Australian Schapelle Corby's jail term

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18160981?print=true

Indonesia has reduced the 20-year jail term of convicted Australian drug
smuggler Schapelle Corby by five years following a clemency plea.

The president approved the move and officials had notified Kerobokan prison in
Bali where Corby is being held, Indonesia's justice ministry confirmed.

Corby, 34, was convicted for drug smuggling in 2005 after 4.1kg (9lb) of
marijuana was found in her bag at Denpasar airport in Bali in 2004.

Australia welcomed the cut in sentence.

"The Australian government has consistently supported Ms Corby's application
for clemency on humanitarian grounds," Foreign Minister Bob Carr said in a
statement.

Corby, a former beauty student who insists she is innocent, filed an appeal to
have her sentence reduced with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono two years
ago, citing humanitarian grounds.

Her lawyer, Iskandar Nawing, said that Corby's mental health had deteriorated
while in jail.

Kerobokan prison was built to hold 300 prisoners but currently houses about
1,000.

Aside from Corby, it holds a number of foreign nationals, including members of
an Australian drug smuggling ring called the "Bali Nine".

Indonesia's Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin said Corby's conviction was "not
related to heroin or other heavy drugs".

"It was purely marijuana and the marijuana didn't weigh hundreds of kilograms,"
he told Reuters news agency.

Regulators probe bank's role in Facebook IPO

http://news.yahoo.com/regulators-probe-banks-role-facebook-ipo-040840829--finan
ce.html

WASHINGTON (AP) - Regulators are examining whether Morgan Stanley, the
investment bank that shepherded Facebook through its highly publicized stock
offering last week, selectively informed clients of an analyst's negative
report about the company before the stock started trading.

Rick Ketchum, the head of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the
self-policing body for the securities industry, said Tuesday that the question
is "a matter of regulatory concern" for his organization and the Securities and
Exchange Commission.

The top securities regulator for Massachusetts, William Galvin, said he had
subpoenaed Morgan Stanley. Galvin said his office is investigating whether
Morgan Stanley divulged to only some clients that one of its analysts had cut
his revenue estimates for Facebook before the stock hit the market on Friday.

The bank said late Tuesday that it "followed the same procedures for the
Facebook offering that it follows for all IPOs," referring to initial public
offerings of stock. It said that its procedures complied with regulations.

The questions about the role played by Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter for
the deal, add to the confusion surrounding Facebook's IPO. In the most hotly
anticipated stock debut in years, the offering raised $16 billion for the
social networking company, valuing it at $104 billion

On Tuesday, Robert Greifeld, the CEO of the Nasdaq Stock Market, acknowledged
to shareholders of Nasdaq's parent company that "clearly we had mistakes within
the Facebook listing."

The stock debut, originally set for 11 a.m. EDT Friday, was delayed more than
half an hour because of technical problems at Nasdaq. Some brokerages were
still sorting out the aftermath on Tuesday.

"Unfortunately, our clients continue to feel the effects of this in some
cases," said Stephen Austin, a spokesman for Fidelity Investments, one of the
country's largest brokerages. Fidelity was still waiting for some Facebook
stock orders that it placed on Friday to be executed. Fidelity's systems had
performed normally, Austin said.

In the meantime, Facebook stock itself has been a disappointment. It fell $3.03
on Tuesday to close at $31 and has now fallen $7, or more than 18 percent, from
its offering price of $38. It managed to add just 23 cents in its first hours
of trading on Friday, then suffered a big decline on Monday.

The Reuters news service reported Tuesday that a Morgan Stanley analyst, Scott
Devitt, cut his estimate for Facebook's revenue this year to $4.85 billion from
more than $5 billion earlier. Reuters reported that it was unclear whether
Morgan Stanley had told only select clients about the reduced estimate.

Reuters reported that the analyst cut his figures for Facebook while the
company's executives, including founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, were shopping
the stock to potential investors in the weeks ahead of the IPO, a process known
in investing as a road show.

Morgan Stanley, in its statement, did not specifically address which clients
might have been told about a reduced estimate from one of its analysts. It said
that "a significant number" of analysts, including those from other firms
underwriting the stock issue, had reduced their estimates for Facebook to
reflect publicly available information about the company.

That was a reference to a May 9 regulatory filing in which Facebook said a
shift by many Facebook users toward mobile devices might limit its revenue
growth. Social media companies have struggled to make as much money as they
would like from mobile advertising. Advertising accounts for more than 80
percent of Facebook's overall revenue.

Morgan Stanley also said that revised analyst views were taken into account in
setting the stock offering price at $38 per share. Facebook, working with
Morgan Stanley, first set a range of $28 to $35 for the offering price, then
raised the range to $34 to $38 before setting it at $38 on the night before the
IPO.

When the stock started trading Friday, it jumped several dollars, but quickly
fell back toward $38. It never crossed below that level on its first day, and
outside analysts said that was probably because Morgan Stanley, eager to avoid
the embarrassment of a first-day decline in the stock price, had rushed in with
thousands of buy orders at $38.

The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday night that Facebook's chief financial
officer, David Ebersman, decided shortly before the stock debut to raise the
number of shares the company would offer by 25 percent. The Journal, citing
people familiar with the planning of the stock offering, also reported that
Morgan Stanley had assured Ebersman there was plenty of demand for the stock.

A spokesman for Facebook Inc., which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., said late
Tuesday that the company had no comment.

The SEC had already said on Friday that it was looking into problems
surrounding the IPO. On Tuesday, the agency's chairman, Mary Schapiro, said: "I
think there is a lot of reason to have confidence in our markets and in the
integrity of how they operate, but there are issues that we need to look at
specifically with respect to Facebook."

I'll Have Another won't run in Belmont Stakes

I'll Have Another, left, with exercise rider Jonny Garcia, accompanied by
stablemate Lava Man, trains at Belmont Park, Friday, June 8, 2012 in Elmont,
N.Y. The Triple Crown hopeful runs Saturday in the Belmont Stakes. (AP

ELMONT, N.Y. -- After earlier Friday pronouncing I'll Have Another "ready to
roll" in the Belmont Stakes, trainer Doug O'Neill told the "Dan Patrick Show"
that his 3-year-old colt is injured and will be scratched from Saturday's race.

It was a devastating blow for O'Neill -- who was scheduled to hold a news
conference later Friday -- and also horse racing fans, who eagerly were
awaiting I'll Have Another's bid for the first Triple Crown since Affirmed in
1978.

No specifics of the injury were given, other than it was to a tendon and that
I'll Have Another likely would be retired.

O'Neill sent his colt out earlier than usual before the trainer slipped off to
spend time with his wife and two children. He left his brother, Dennis, to take
care of the barn. At another point in the backstretch, trainer Bob Baffert, who
will send out Paynter in the Belmont, left early to pick up his wife at the
airport.

O'Neill sent I'll Have Another out at 5:30 a.m. EDT to avoid the rush from the
Belmont Stakes barn later in the morning. He made the announcement of the
injury on Patrick's show about six hours later.

Before disclosing the injury, O'Neill talked about the horse going to the
track.

"It's been very hectic the last few days, so we thought we would take him out
when it's quieter," O'Neill said after I'll Have Another jogged a half-mile and
then galloped an "easy" mile with his barn coach, Lava Man.

"He is fit and ready to go and we are just trying to let him bring as much
energy to before would be a good move. He stayed with coach Lava Man just to
keep everything off-speed. I was very pleased with it. We are ready to roll."

O'Neill said it was so hectic around the detention barn later in the morning
that he found it hard to work. This is the first time ever that the New York
Racing Association has required all Belmont Stakes horses to be kept in a
detention barn with heavy security.

"We just wanted to get him out when it was a little quieter," O'Neill said.
"The detention barn setup with all 12 of the horses goijng out at the same time
has been a little hectic. The simple thing of just trying to find a place to
bathe your horse has been kind of congested. We want to get him the quietest
frame of mind leading up to the biggest race of his life."

Instead of "quiet time" O'Neill went off to enjoy family time with his wife,
Linette, and two children, son Daniel, 9, and daughter, Kaylin, 7.

(CBS/AP) RIALTO, Calif. - Rodney King, whose beating by police officers in 1991
was captured on videotape, exacerbating racial tensions in Los Angeles, has
been found dead. He was 47.

Rialto Police Capt. Randy De Anda told KNX Newsradio that about 5:25 a.m. on
Sunday, the police department received a 911 call from King's fiancee who
reported that he was found in the bottom of his swimming pool.

"Rialto police officers responded to the location and removed him from inside
of the pool and began CPR," De Anda said. "The Rialto Fire Department
paramedics responded and transported Mr. King to the Arrowhead Regional Medical
Center, where he was later pronounced dead at 6:11 a.m.

"It appears there was some verbal contact with the fiancee at which time she
went outside and she found him at the bottom of the pool," De Anda said, adding
that Rialto police are conducting a drowning investigation.

Preliminary information showed no signs of foul play, he said.

King became known worldwide in 1991 when a videotape recording of his beating
and arrest by LAPD officers was made public. King was stopped for speeding in
the San Fernando Valley on the night of March 3, 1991, and was beaten by four
officers who hit and kicked him, and used a stun gun.

George Holliday, a plumber, was awakened by the traffic stop outside his home
and recorded the encounter with a video camera. Its broadcast led to outrage,
and charges against the police officers.

The following year the officers were acquitted by a predominantly white jury.
Anger over the decision sparked a riot that left 55 people dead and more than
2,000 injured.

During a news conference at the time of the riots, King poignantly pleaded,
"Can we all get along? Can we get along? Can we stop making it horrible for the
older people and the kids?"

Microsoft stuck with $1 billion fine in European antitrust case

http://money.cnn.com/2012/06/27/technology/microsoft-1-billion-fine-antitrust/

By Julianne Pepitone @CNNMoneyTech June 27, 2012: 2:02 PM ET

NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Microsoft is stuck paying a $1 billion fine for an
antitrust ruling handed down in 2008, after a European court on Wednesday
rejected the company's long-running appeal.

Microsoft was charged in 2004 with refusing to make "certain interoperability
information" available to competitors between 1998 and 2004. That kept rivals'
products from working with Windows' server software.

A series of rulings from the European Commission over the next few years led to
fines totaling billions. The lion's share of the financial penalties came
because of Microsoft's "noncompliance" with those rulings.

The European antitrust case has cost Microsoft a whopping $2.04 billion in
total, including Wednesday's ruling from the General Court of the European
Union, which upheld almost all of the Commission's previously levied fines.

Microsoft has nearly $60 billion in cash on hand and has already paid the fine,
but it appealed in hopes of getting its money refunded.

"We are disappointed with the Court's ruling," Microsoft said Wednesday in a
written statement.

The company emphasized that it is back on good terms with European antitrust
regulators, saying: "In 2009 Microsoft entered into a broad understanding with
the Commission that resolved its competition law concerns."

The battle started in 2004, when the European Commission ruled that Microsoft
had to pay a 497 million euro penalty (about $620 million) for keeping key
information from its competitors. Microsoft was ordered to make the information
available through "reasonable and "non-discriminatory terms."

But in 2006, the Commission said that Microsoft didn't comply quickly enough
with the order and that it charged exorbitant amounts for access to the
information. So Microsoft was slapped with another fine: more than 280 million
euro ($350 million).

Microsoft continued to charge "unreasonable rates," the Commission ruled, and
so in 2008 it ordered the company to pay another 899 million euro ($1.12
billion).

Microsoft appealed that decision to the General Court. The court's ruling on
Wednesday knocked down Microsoft's objections.

However, the court did reduce the 2008 fine to 860 million euros ($1.07
billion), down from 899 million euro. The court cited a 2005 letter from the
Commission, which told Microsoft that it could "restrict distribution of
products developed by its 'open-source' competitors," as its reason for
lowering the fine.

That letter helped Microsoft score a nearly $50 million discount on the fine.
Considering that this case has now cost Microsoft more than $2 billion -- more
than it spent this week buying Yammer -- saving a few million is pretty cold
comfort.

from USA Today>

The Supreme Court upheld the health care law today in a splintered, complex
opinion that appears to give President Obama a major victory.

Basically. the justices said that the individual mandate -- the requirement
that most Americans buy health insurance or pay a fine -- is constitutional as
a tax.

Chief Justice John Roberts -- a conservative appointed by President George W.
Bush -- provided the key vote to preserve the landmark health care law, which
figures to be a major issue in Obama's re-election bid against Republican
opponent Mitt Romney.

The announcement will have a major impact on the nation's health care system,
the actions of both federal and state governments, and the course of the
November presidential and congressional elections.

A key question for the high court: The law's individual mandate, the
requirement that nearly all Americans buy health insurance, or pay a penalty.

Critics call the requirement an unconstitutional overreach by Congress and the
Obama administration; supporters say it is necessary to finance the health care
plan, and well within the government's powers under the Commerce Clause of the
U.S. Constitution.

While the individual mandate remained 18 months away from implementation, many
other provisions already have gone into effect, such as free wellness exams for
seniors and allowing children up to age 26 to remain on their parents' health
insurance policies. Some of those provisions are likely to be retained by some
insurance companies.

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - The worst Midwest drought in
a quarter century is doing more damage to U.S. crops than widely
believed, already shrinking corn yields to the lowest in nearly
a decade, the government said on Wednesday.
    In a report that reignited a near-record rally in grain
prices, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the crop will
average just 146.0 bushels an acre, down 20 bushels from its
June estimate and lower than analysts' estimates just a week
ago. One official said it was the biggest such cut he could
recall.
    The dramatic scaling back of what had initially been
forecast to be a record harvest has sent corn and soybean prices
up by more than a third over the past month, as extreme heat and
dry conditions stunt corn growth in the world's largest grower
and exporter.
    Corn prices raced more than 3 percent higher and soybeans
were close to a record high on Wednesday before profit taking
and forecasts for slightly wetter weather curtailed gains.
    Prices are still up more than a third over the past month as
the drought threatens to set off another year of food price
inflation and supply concerns.
    The USDA cut its corn harvest projection to 12.97 billion
bushels for 2012/13 - still the third largest on record. The
yield would be the lowest since 2003, although still far higher
than the 85 bushels an acre following the drought of 1988.
    The surprisingly deep cuts to the supply outlook jolted
traders, who had expected the USDA to be more conservative in
adjusting its views. The chairman of World Agriculture Outlook
Board said the 12 percent cut was the largest he could recall.
    "They sent a signal of, 'Listen, we got a serious problem
here'," said Don Roose, an analyst with U.S. Commodities.
    As a result, USDA reduced its forecast for corn ending
stocks - the amount of grain still in bins at the end of next
summer, before the new harvest -  by 37 percent from last month,
more than the 32-percent reduction expected.
    At 1.183 billion bushels, U.S. corn stockpiles will still
rise by nearly a third from this year's ultra-low levels, with
the reduced supply outlook partly offset by downward revisions
to exports and ethanol usage as near-record prices curb
consumption. Separate data showed ethanol output fell last week
for the fourth time, reaching its lowest in two years.
    Wheat and soybean stocks were also below expectations.
Soybean yields were cut nearly 8 percent to 40.5 bushels per
acre, the second lowest since 2003, due to the drought.
    The USDA cut its forecast for global corn stocks by 14
percent, although inventories will still be the highest in three
years.
    By midday, December corn on the Chicago Board of Trade
was down 0.9 percent at $7.11 a bushel, while November soybean
 futures rose 0.4 percent to $15.45 a bushel. Front-month
wheat gained 0.7 percent to $8.10 a bushel.
    The report "tells me they feel pretty confident this crop
has been hurt in a big way," says Shawn McCambridge, analyst at
Jefferies Bache. Additional cuts are likely, he said, when USDA
makes spot checks of fields as it prepares for an Aug. 10 report
which will make the first estimate of the harvest.

    TIGHT STOCKS
    This would be the third year in a row of tight corn
supplies. U SDA reduced by 100 million bushels, or 2 percent, its
forecast of corn for ethanol. It also reduced export and
livestock feed forecasts.
    Higher feed prices will depress U.S. meat production and cut
into margins for companies like Tyson and Smithfield
.. with per capita consumption would drop by 1 percent, to
200.6 lbs in 2013 because of smaller supplies and higher prices.
    Other food prices could be affected as well. Corn, wheat and
soybeans, the three most widely grown U.S. crops, are the raw
ingredients in a panorama of foods from cereals and salad
dressing to scones and cooking oil.
    "The immediate view is that crop producers will bear the
brunt of financial losses but losses in animal industries will
be enormous in the coming year, perhaps becoming considerably
greater than for the crop sector," said Chris Hurt, agricultural
economist at Purdue University, pointing to high feed prices.
    China was forecast to import 5 million tonnes of corn in the
marketing year that opens on Sept 1, down 2 million tonnes from
the USDA's June forecast as available U.S. supplies shrink.
    The USDA also reduced its estimated carryover stocks of
wheat to 664 million bushels and soybeans to 130 million bushels
soybeans, compared with trade expectations of 718 million
bushels of wheat and 141 million bushels of soybeans.
    USDA cut its forecast of the wheat crop in Russia by 4
million tonnes due to poor yields, in Kazakhstan by 2 million
tonnes because of hot and dry weather in June, and in China by 2
million tonnes due to lower yields.
    Since mid-June, corn and soybean crop conditions have
worsened. Just 40 percent of the corn crop is now rated good or
excellent, down 20 points in a month. It was the lowest such
rating for the time of year - early July - since the 1988
drought, which also impacted crops early in the growing season.

(Reuters) - The worst drought in a half century will continue to plague most of
the U.S. Midwest crop region for at least the next 10 days, with only
occasional showers providing some relief mainly in the east, an agricultural
meteorologist said on Thursday.

America's top two corn and soybean producing states, Iowa and Illinois, are now
in the center of the drought as the dryness spreads to the northwest to leech
what little moisture remains in already parched soils.

"It looks a little wetter today for Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, but the west is
still dry with above-normal temperatures," said Jason Nicholls, meteorologist
for AccuWeather.

Rain for the next 10 days will run the gamut from just 40 to 75 percent of
normal, with the greatest stress in the western Midwest crop states such as top
producer Iowa.

"It got up to 102 to 103 degrees Fahrenheit in Iowa yesterday with no rain, and
will be in the 90s today with no rain," Nicholls said.

Rainfall overnight Wednesday left up to 1.5 inches in Chicago and an inch in
Rockford, Illinois. "Only isolated rains, no drought buster," he stressed. In
addition to rain in northeastern Illinois, showers fell in southern Wisconsin,
Indiana and southwestern Michigan.

"It will be cooler on Friday but the heat will be back for the weekend into
early next week. The 11- to 15-day forecast shows the ridge moving west over
the Rockies so that may help cut back on the heat, but there is still no
significant rain in sight," he said.

An atmospheric high pressure ridge has entrenched itself over the heart of the
U.S. corn and soybean producing states, preventing moisture from moving into
the crop belt, leading to a buildup of heat, causing crop losses and spawning
record-high corn and soy prices.

Commodity Weather Group (CWG) on Thursday predicted the heat would last longer
next week than had earlier been forecast.

More than half of the Midwest was severely dry.

"The most concern is in west central Indiana, much of Illinois, far northern
Missouri, most of Iowa, southwest Minnesota, southern South Dakota, Nebraska
and Kansas," said CWG meteorologist Joel Widenor.

Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) corn has soared nearly 50 percent in just six
weeks to a record high $8.08-1/2 per bushel on Thursday, besting the previous
record of $7.99-3/4 set 13 months ago.

CBOT soybeans notched record highs for two days in a row reaching a peak of
$17.23 per bushel on Thursday, above the previous record of $16.85-1/2 hit the
previous day and up 30 percent since early June.

As the drought, rated the worst since 1956, expands to the northern and western
Midwest, areas that had previously been spared, analysts were slashing corn
yield estimates by the hour. Some were also starting to cut their forecasts on
the number of acres that will be harvested as farmers opt to plow under some of
their parched fields to claim insurance.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in its weekly crop progress report
issued on Monday, said that just 31 percent of the corn crop was in good to
excellent shape, down from 40 percent a week earlier and below analysts'
average estimate of 35 percent.

Soybean conditions fell to 34 percent from 40 percent in the good-to- excellent
category, likewise below estimates for 35 percent.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in a report on
Monday that, based on the Palmer Drought Index, 55 percent of the contiguous
United States was under moderate to extreme drought in June. That is the
largest land area in the United States to be affected by a drought since
December 1956.

UN arms treaty aims at terror, but puts Second Amendment in crosshairs

Published July 21, 2012

UNITED NATIONS --  American Second Amendment rights and U.S. foreign policy
interests could be directly threatened by the latest wording of a United
Nations draft treaty seeking control over international trade in conventional
weapons, FoxNews.com has learned.

A U.S. delegate argued against the provisions during closed-door talks Friday,
but insiders close to the proceedings say UN approval of a final document by
the self-imposed July 27 deadline remains likely.

The development comes just days after Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president
of the National Rifle Association, warned there should be "no compromise" on
the issue of a U.S. citizen's right to own a firearm.

"We will not stand idly by while international organizations, whether
state-based or stateless, attempt to undermine the fundamental liberties that
our men and women in uniform have fought so bravely to preserve -- and on which
our entire American system of government is based," LaPierre told the UN
Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT).

The latest draft bars weapons transfers to "non-state actors" -- which, by
definition, include private citizens.

While treaty supporters say the provision speaks to a long-stated goal of
denying weapons to terrorists, many experts warn of wider consequences.

"The ATT will not limit the ability of terrorists to acquire arms. The reason
for this is simple: The UN has never defined terrorism, because some member
states insist that terrorist groups like Hamas are struggling against so-called
foreign occupation," Ted Bromund, senior research fellow with the
Washington-based Heritage Foundation's Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom,
told the conference last week.

Implementation of the latest draft risks restricting U.S. foreign policy
because it could limit Washington's ability to sell arms to strategic allies
such as Israel and Taiwan, one insider explained.

"It says states 'shall not authorize' arms transfers unless they take account
of certain issues, but the U.S. took the view that [the criteria] was
incompatible with the current U.S. export control system," this insider
explained.

Despite the U.S. objections, the source told FoxNews.com: "Momentum overall is
still very strong for getting a treaty." To meet the deadline, emergency
sessions have been arranged for this weekend -- even though translators may not
be on hand.

The U.S. mission to the UN did not respond to a request for comment on the
latest turns in the talks, which are taking place in New York.

UN resistance to exempting civilian arms from the treaty is linked to the fact
that few of the world body's 193 member states provide their citizens with a
constitutional right to bear arms.

The U.S. opposition to arms transfer restrictions, meanwhile, marks a clear
acknowledgement on the part of the Obama administration that the treaty, as it
stands, risks straitjacketing U.S. foreign policy.

Indeed, such wording applied historically might have constrained the Reagan
Doctrine, which allowed for giving overt and covert aid to anti-communist
resistance movements during the ultimately successful Cold War confrontation
against the Soviet Union.

In discussing other ways the draft treaty has evolved, the source close to the
talks said there is now "some momentum" towards exempting ammunition from the
treaty. This would meet a key U.S. and gun lobby demand. There may now also be
no reporting requirements for small arms and light weapons sales.

But the U.S. Friday did not oppose the draft treaty's call for proscription of
arms transfers that "prolong international instability," the source confided.

With the word "instability" serving as UN code for "war," this provision could
arguably help aggressors who strike first to hold onto their gains, some
analysts will argue. That's because states would not be able to help the losing
side by arming it.

Arizona sheriff faces civil trial in alleged targeting of Latinos

By Casey Wian and Michael Martinez, CNN

July 20, 2012 -- Updated 1355 GMT (2155 HKT)

http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/19/justice/arizona-arpaio-trial/index.html

Phoenix (CNN) -- Attorneys gave opening statements Thursday in a civil trial
accusing an Arizona sheriff -- who bills himself as "America's toughest" -- and
his department of racial discrimination against Latinos.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona and other attorneys are
representing Hispanics in a class-action lawsuit accusing Maricopa County
Sheriff Joe Arpaio of civil rights and constitutional violations. The bench
trial is being held in the U.S. District Court in Phoenix.

In his opening remarks, Stanley Young, an attorney for the plaintiffs, told the
judge that Arpaio and his department violated "the fundamental value of equal
protection under the law" through a "policy of racial discrimination and
mistreatment of Hispanics."

Tim Casey, an attorney for the sheriff, told the court that "there is no
evidence that race or ethnicity played a factor" in the detention of the five
named plaintiffs.

"Ethnic constituency of the neighborhood plays no role" in the Maricopa County
Sheriff's Department's selection of neighborhoods for saturation patrols, Casey
said in court.

Arpaio is expected to appear in court to testify early next week.

Outside the federal courthouse, Arpaio critics demonstrated and carried
placards stating, "No justice. No peace. No racist police."

Among the first witnesses Thursday was Ralph Taylor, a Temple University
professor of criminal justice. Taylor testified that he did a statistical
analysis that shows Hispanics are more likely to be checked for immigration
status during saturation patrols than non-Hispanics are.

Arpaio is nationally known for his tough stances against illegal immigration,
but critics have said for years that his approach has created a system of
racial profiling.

The U.S. Justice Department has also filed a civil rights lawsuit against him,
but Thursday's trial is for a different lawsuit brought by Hispanics who say
they were discriminated against.

The class-action lawsuit, filed in 2007, claims that Arpaio and the Maricopa
County Sheriff's Office "launched a series of massive so-called 'crime
suppression sweeps' that show a law enforcement agency operating well beyond
the bounds of the law."

The plaintiffs are also being represented by the law firm Covington & Burling.

"They're never easy cases, there's no smoking gun," ACLU of Arizona legal
director Dan Pochoda said of the class-action suit. "We don't expect a memo in
the file that says let's get these people solely because they're Hispanic. We
believe the evidence will demonstrate that is indeed effectively what was
done."

Arpaio and his attorneys declined to comment before the trial.

In a CNN interview last year, Arpaio said his department would continue to
pursue illegal immigrants.

"I know I'm doing the right thing. I'm not going to surrender by those little
small groups, people that don't like what I'm doing. You think I'm going to
surrender? It'll never happen," the sheriff said.

The lawsuit charges that the sheriff's office "unlawfully instituted a pattern
and practice of targeting Latino drivers and passengers in Maricopa County
during traffic stops," the ACLU said in a statement.

The sheriff's tactics violate the Equal Protection Act by discriminating by
race and result in prolonged detentions that violate protections against
unreasonable searches, the ACLU said.

The office's "pattern and practice of racial profiling goes beyond these sweeps
to include widespread, day-to-day targeting and mistreatment of persons who
appear to be Latino," the lawsuit states.

Among the plaintiffs is Manuel Ortega Melendres, a visitor to Arizona who
possessed a valid visa. In September 2007, he was arrested after the car he was
riding in was pulled over by Maricopa County deputies. The lawsuit alleges that
Melendres showed the officers his identification but was nonetheless treated
roughly and arrested. He sat in a cell for hours before a federal immigration
agent confirmed that his documents were in order.

As a result of his ordeal, Melendres was left "frightened to walk on the street
or be seen in public in Maricopa County because he fears that the sheriff's
officers will come and arrest him again because he is Latino and does not speak
English," the lawsuit states.

(CNN) -- Sally Ride, the first American woman to fly in space, died Monday
after a 17-month battle with pancreatic cancer, her company said. She was 61.

"Sally lived her life to the fullest, with boundless energy, curiosity,
intelligence, passion, commitment, and love. Her integrity was absolute; her
spirit was immeasurable; her approach to life was fearless," read a statement
on the website of Sally Ride Science, a company she started to help teach
students -- particularly young women and girls -- about science, math and
technology.

Share your tributes to Sally Ride

Ride flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Challenger in 1983 to become
America's first woman in space. She took a second trip aboard the same shuttle
one year later.

The first woman in space was Soviet astronaut Valentina Tereshkova, who orbited
the earth 48 times in 1963.

"As the first American woman to travel into space, Sally was a national hero
and a powerful role model," President Barack Obama said soon after news of her
death broke. "She inspired generations of young girls to reach for the stars
and later fought tirelessly to help them get there by advocating for a greater
focus on science and math in our schools. Sally's life showed us that there are
no limits to what we can achieve and I have no doubt that her legacy will
endure for years to come."

A Los Angeles native, Ride attended Stanford University, where she earned four
degrees including a doctorate in physics, according to NASA. She joined the
agency as part of the class of 1978, the first to include women.

She left NASA more than a decade later and became part of the faculty at the
University of California, San Diego. Ride was the author of several books.

She is survived by her partner of 27 years, Tam O'Shaughnessy, her mother, her
sister, and other family members.

NEW DELHI (AP) . Northern India's power grid crashed Monday, halting hundreds
of trains, forcing hospitals and airports to use backup generators and leaving
370 million people . more than the population of the United States and Canada
combined . sweltering in the summer heat.

The blackout, the worst to hit India in a decade, highlighted the nation's
inability to feed a growing hunger for energy as it strives to become a
regional economic power.

Some small businesses were forced to shut for the day. Buildings were without
water because the pumps weren't working. Muslim families were forced to eat
their pre-dawn meals by candlelight before beginning their daytime Ramadan
fast. "It was really difficult," said farmer Mohammed Zaman.

The northern grid crashed about 2:30 a.m. because it could no longer keep up
with the huge demand for power in the hot summer, officials in the state of
Uttar Pradesh said. However, Power Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said he was not
sure exactly what caused the collapse and had formed a committee to investigate
it.

The grid feeds the nation's breadbasket in Punjab, the war-wracked region of
Kashmir, the burgeoning capital of New Delhi, the Dalai Lama's Himalayan
headquarters in Dharmsala and the world's most populous state, the poverty
stricken Uttar Pradesh.

By late morning, 60 percent of the power had been restored in the eight
northern states affected by the outage and the rest was expected to be back on
line by the afternoon, Shinde said. The grid was drawing power from the
neighboring eastern and western grids as well as getting hydroelectric power
from the small neighboring mountain kingdom of Bhutan.

New Delhi residents were roused from sleep when their fans and air conditioners
stopped and came out of their homes in the heat as the entire city turned dark.
Temperatures in the city were in the mid-30s (90s Fahrenheit) with 89 percent
humidity. New Delhi's Metro transit system, with 1.8 million daily riders,
stopped for hours during the morning commute. Some trains across the northern
region were stranded when their electric engines failed. Others were delayed by
hours as they were hooked to diesel engines.

Amit  Naik, a toy maker in New Delhi, was forced to close his workshop for the
day.

"There was no water, so my machine couldn't run. Other people had the same
difficulties," he said.

While the outage was unique in its reach, its impact was softened by Indians'
familiarity with almost daily power outages of varying duration. Hospitals and
major businesses have backup generators that kick in when during power cuts,
and upscale homes run on backup systems powered by truck batteries.

"This will obviously get worse," said Subhash Chawla, a 65-year-old retiree who
took the Metro once power was restored. "Unless the Metro has a separate power
supply, it will be chaos in the future."

The Confederation of Indian Industry said the outage was a reminder of the
urgent need for the government to fix the power sector, ensure a steady supply
of coal for power plants and reform the electricity utilities. Transmission and
distribution losses in some states are as much as 50 percent because of theft
and corruption by employees in the power industry.

Shinde deflected criticism, pointing out that the United States and Brazil also
had huge power failures in recent years.

"I ask you to look at the power situation in other countries as well," he said.

The failure was the first time since 2001 that the northern grid had collapsed.
But India's demand for electricity has soared since then as its economy has
grown sharply. The outage was a reminder of the country's long road ahead in
upgrading its infrastructure to meet its aspirations of being an economic
superpower.

India's Central Electricity Authority reports power deficits of about 8 percent
in recent months. But any connection to the grid remains a luxury for many.
One-third of India's households do not even have electricity to power a light
bulb, according to last year's census.

The power deficit was worsened by a weak monsoon that lowered hydroelectric
generation and kept temperatures higher, further increasing electricity usage
as people seek to cool off. Shivpal Singh Yadav, the power minister in the
state of Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, said that while demand
during peak hours hits 11,000 megawatts, the state can only provide 9,000
megawatts.

Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation chief Avnish Awasthi blamed the grid collapse
on states drawing more than their allotted power to meet the summer demand.

Earlier this month, angry crowds blocked traffic and clashed with police after
blackouts in the Delhi suburb of Gurgaon that houses many high-rise apartment
blocks and offices.  With no power in some neighborhoods for more than 24
hours, people erected blockades that paralyzed traffic for several hours.

At Least 7 Dead in Shooting at Sikh Temple in Wisconsin

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/06/us/shooting-reported-at-temple-in-wisconsin.h
tml?_r=1&hp

At least one gunman opened fire in a Sikh temple near Milwaukee on Sunday,
killing at least six and injuring several others before being shot himself, the
police said. The gunman was killed in a shootout with the police.

The shootings occurred about 10:30 a.m. at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in the
town of Oak Creek, just south of Milwaukee, officials said.

The authorities described the scene at the temple as chaotic as they attended
to the victims and tried to sort out what had happened. The police said they
were still uncertain whether there were other gunmen at the temple. Bradley
Wentlandt, the chief of police in nearby Greenfield, told journalists on the
scene that four bodies had been found inside the temple and three were found
outside, including that of the suspect. He said a veteran police officer who
arrived on the scene exchanged fire with the gunman.

"That officer was shot multiple times," Mr. Wentlandt said. "The shooter was
put down."

The Oak Creek Police Chief, John Edwards, said the gunman was killed by a
second officer who was at the scene.

 By Associated Press, Updated: Friday, August 10, 10:55 AM

ST. LOUIS . The government slashed its expectations for U.S. corn and soybean
production for the second consecutive month Friday, predicting what could be
the lowest average corn yield in more than 15 years as the worst drought in
decades continued punishing key farm states.

Nonetheless, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, in a statement supplied
exclusively to The Associated Press, insisted that U.S. farmers and ranchers
remain resilient and that the country would continue to meet demand as the
global leader in farm exports and food aid.

The U.S. Agriculture Department cut its projected U.S. corn production to 10.8
billion bushels, down 17 percent from its forecast last month of nearly 13
billion bushels and 13 percent lower than last year. That also would be the
lowest production since 2006.

The USDA, in its monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report,
now expects corn growers to average 123.4 bushels per acre, down 24 bushels
from last year in what would be the lowest average yield in 17 years.

Soybean production is now forecast at 2.69 billion bushels, a 12 percent
decline from last year and well off the 3.05 billion bushels the USDA had
expected last month. Expected yields on average of 36.1 bushels per acre would
be the lowest since 2003.

Friday.s revised outlook comes months after corn farmers forecast a record year
when they planted, sowing 96.4 million acres . the most since 1937. But the
USDA now forecasts the area to be harvested at 87.4 million acres.

On Thursday, the U.N. food agency drew a direct correlation between price hikes
in basic food commodities and the months of parched conditions in farm states.
The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said in its monthly price
report that its overall food price index climbed 6 percentage points in July,
although it was well below the peak reached in February 2011. The FAO.s index,
considered a global benchmark used to track market volatility and price trends,
measures the monthly price changes for a basket of food items including
cereals, oils and fats, meat, dairy products and sugar.

Severe drought punishing the U.S..s midsection has sent corn prices soaring,
and expectations of worsened crop prospects in Russia because of dry weather
sent world wheat prices up 19 percent, according to the FAO, which keeps close
tabs on volatile global prices. Spikes in the prices of staple foods have led
to riots in some countries in recent years.

But on Friday, Vilsack tried to tamp down such concerns.

"Americans shouldn.t see immediate increases in food prices due to the
drought," said Vilsack, as he visited drought-stricken Nebraska and with plans
to be in Iowa next week. "What is important going forward is that we continue
to do all we can to help the farmers, ranchers, small businesses and
communities being impacted by this drought."

Rick Whitacre, a professor of agricultural economics at Illinois State
University, said consumers may see modest increases in prices in grocery stores
due to tightened corn supplies because the grain is so ubiquitous, found in
everything from cosmetics to cereal, soda, cake mixes and candy bars. But he
believes the bigger fallout will come in 4 to 6 percent price increases for
beef and pork, with many ranchers having sold off their livestock as feed costs
rise and the drought burned up their pasturelands.

"You.re going to see the ripple of this go out for quite a distance," Whitacre
said. "We may see some upward pressure (on prices), especially in things like
vegetable oil and a lot of our food products," but that should be manageable.

The U.S. leads the world in exporting corn, soybeans and wheat, and the surging
prices are expected to be felt across the international marketplace, hurting
poor food-importing countries, said a study by British charity Oxfam issued on
the eve of the U.N. report.

Vilsack said he has pressed Congress to pass a comprehensive, multi-year farm
bill "that gives farmers and ranchers more certainty in this tough time, while
giving USDA tools to help those producers affected by weather-related events
beyond their control."

The USDA foreshadowed the newly lowered yield projections, noting earlier this
week that exactly half of the nation.s corn crop was rated poor to very poor,
up 2 percentage points from the previous week and creeping closer to the peak
of 53 percent of 24 years ago. Some 39 percent of soybeans now fall under those
two categories, rising 2 percentage points for the second straight week and
eclipsing the 1988 benchmark of 37 percent.

The nation.s rangeland and pastures are faring even worse, with roughly
three-fifths rated to be in poor to very poor shape . the largest area thus
affected in 18 years.

Friday.s USDA report amplified the troubling picture painted a day earlier when
the latest weekly U.S. Drought Monitor map showed that the drought conditions
continue to worsen in Plains states, where production of corn and soybeans is
key. That update showed that the expanse still gripped by extreme or
exceptional drought . the two worst classifications . rose to 24.14 percent, up
nearly 2 percentage points from the previous week.

Federal scientists say this July was the hottest on record, smoking out even
the sweltering temperatures set in the Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported Wednesday that the first seven
months of 2012 were the warmest on record while the stretch from August 2011
through July this year was the balmiest 12-month period the U.S. has
experienced.

Mitt Romney has tapped Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan to be his running mate, Fox
News confirms.

Romney will make the selection official during a campaign stop Saturday morning
in Norfolk, Va., before launching his "The Romney Plan For A Stronger Middle
Class" bus tour.

The selection comes roughly two weeks before the start of the Republican
National Convention in Tampa, and gives Romney plenty of space to rally the
party behind his pick before the official nomination.

The announcement comes as some polls, including a recent Fox News survey, show
the Republican presidential candidate losing some ground to President Obama.

Ryan, already considered a rising star in the Republican Party, is chairman of
the House Budget Committee. He.s been in Congress since 1999 and is best known
this session for his controversial budget plan that includes an overhaul of
Medicare.

EATTLE (AP) . These aren't your typical loos. One uses microwave energy to
transform human waste into electricity. Another captures urine and uses it for
flushing. And still another turns excrement into charcoal.

They are part of a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation competition to reinvent the
toilet for the 2.6 billion people around the world who don't have access to
modern sanitation.

Scientists from around the world have taken up the challenge and the foundation
planned to announced Tuesday which projects would be getting more money to take
their ideas from the lab to cities.

There, local entrepreneurs will use the new technology to turn pollution into
cash.
To pass the foundation's threshold for the world's next toilet, it must operate
without water, electricity or a septic system, not discharge pollutants,
preferably capture energy or other resources and operate at a cost of 5 cents a
day.

The United Nations estimates disease caused by unsafe sanitation results in
about half the hospitalizations in the developing world. About 1.5 million
children die each year from diarrheal disease.

Scientists believe most of these deaths could be prevented with proper
sanitation, along with safe drinking water and improved hygiene.

The foundation expects to field test its first prototypes within the next three
years.

Most of the prototypes on display this week in the open courtyard of the
foundation's Seattle headquarters turn solid waste into energy. This is both a
practical and pragmatic solution to the solid waste puzzle, said Carl Hensman,
program officer for the foundation's water, sanitation and hygiene team.

The roughly $42 million project started just about a year ago and Hensman said
they decided to hold a toilet fair this week to show how far the scientists
have gotten in that time and to give them an opportunity to learn from each
other and potentially collaborate.

Among those scheduled to attend the toilet fair were government ministers from
African nations, utility workers and potential financial partners like UNICEF
and Oxfam.

Reinventing the toilet has the potential to improve lives as well as the
environment.

Flush toilets waste tons of potable drinking water each year, fail to recapture
reusable resources like the potential energy in solid waste and are simply
impractical in so many places.

"The question is why haven't we done this before," Hensman said.

Two deputies killed, two wounded in Louisiana shooting

http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/16/justice/louisiana-officers-shot/index.html

Two law enforcement officers died and two were injured in a series of
apparently linked shootings early Thursday in LaPlace, Louisiana, authorities
said.

The first shooting happened in a parking lot at a steel plant, Sheriff Mike
Tregre said. The second happened when officers went to a nearby trailer park to
investigate the first shooting and were ambushed by a man armed with what the
sheriff described as an assault rifle, he said.

In addition to the two wounded law enforcement officers, some of the five
people taken into custody also suffered gunshot wounds, Tregre said.

Investigators were still sorting out what role those detained may have had in
the shootings, Tregre said.

(CBS News) Alleged Aurora, Colo, shooter James Holmes met with not one, but at
least three mental health professionals at the University of Colorado prior to
the massacre. How long he met with each one and the depth of their involvement
is not clear, but it adds to the picture of Holmes being clearly on their radar
in the time period leading up to the shootings.


At the University of Colorado Anschutz Campus, James Holmes had been a PhD
student in neuroscience. But last June, he dropped out and was buying guns.
Before he left this campus, he had seen at least three mental health
professionals associated with student mental health services.


Only one name has been publicly disclosed: Dr. Lynne Fenton, who is subpoenaed
to appear in court in the Holmes case. At issue is a package mailed by Holmes
to her and recovered in the campus mail room three days after the shootings.
Holmes lawyers say it is priviledged material. Legal analyst Raj Chohan says
they want to prevent the prosecution from using it. and have it turned over to
them now.

"The defense is going to have every opportunity to present a competent defense
and that means Mr, Holmes is going to be able to gain access to all the
documents he may have put out there and authored himself," Chohan said.


That includes Holmes medical records. His name was brought to the attention of
the university's Behavior Evaluation and Threat Assessment team or BETA for
short. A flow chart released by the university shows guidelines for action that
could be followed if a person is deemed a direct threat.


University of Colorado campus police were contacted at least for a background
check on Holmes, but what happened from there is not clear.


Dr. Richard Martinez, a director of forensic psychiatry with Denver Health
Medical Center, said: "At the moment you determine that there is a credible
threat here, a credible possibility, the duty to warn is triggered if you
will."

AFP - US corn and soybean prices closed at new record highs Tuesday as a new
survey showed worse-than-expected crop damage from a brutal drought across the
country's central breadbasket.

The price of corn jumped 1.7 percent to $8.3875 a bushel, while soybeans
finished at $17.3025 a bushel, up 2.8 percent from Tuesday.

That left the corn price up 68 percent from June and soybeans 39 percent
higher.

An all-time record hot July accompanied by nearly three months of extreme
drought have baked the country's prime farmland in the midwestern and central
states, where the world's largest corn and soybean crops are grown.

Prices jumped after reports from the annual Pro Farmer Midwest Tour gave
analysts and traders more bad news on the state of the crops.

"Crops in western Ohio and eastern Indiana were far below the norm," said Pro
Farmer analyst Brian Grete.

Yields in South Dakota meanwhile were called "stunningly low."

"The Pro Farmer tour sparked the rally" Tuesday, said Frank Cholly of RJO
Futures.

"They have a pretty good peg at final yields," he said.

The Pro Farmer estimates were significantly lower than the US Department of
Agriculture's sharply slashed forecasts from last week.

"We are getting less production from South America, so that forces buyers to go
to the US," driving up prices, Cholly added.

On August 10, the USDA sharply reduced its production forecast for the globally
crucial crops, saying output would likely be at the lowest level in six years.

Last week, they estimated that 50 percent of the corn crop was in poor or very
poor condition, compared to 15 percent at the same time last year.

For soybeans, 39 percent of the crop was in poor condition or worse, compared
to 13 percent a year ago.

The drought has also hit feeds for livestock like hay, forcing ranchers to trim
their herds, which analysts expect could push up the price of meat in the
coming year.

Mexican Federal Police attack U.S. diplomatic vehicle

Gunmen attacked an American diplomatic vehicle south of Mexico City on Friday

STORY HIGHLIGHTS

    NEW: U.S. Embassy says the wounded Americans are in stable condition
    Mexican Marines say Federal Police opened fire on the U.S. Embassy vehicle
    Two embassy employees -- said to be U.S. citizens -- were wounded

Mexico City (CNN) -- Mexican federales were facing questioning Friday after
authorities accused them of opening fire on a U.S. diplomatic vehicle south of
the capital.

Two U.S. Embassy employees -- described by a senior U.S. government official as
U.S. citizens -- were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening wounds; a
member of the Mexican Navy who was with them in the late-model Toyota Land
Cruiser suffered light bruises, according to the Navy, which issued a statement
giving the following account of events:

The incident unfolded at 8 a.m., as the two embassy employees and the Mexican
en route to a military facility in the municipality of Xalatlaco. Some 4
kilometers (2.5 miles) earlier, they had left the main highway that connects
Mexico City with Cuernavaca, near the town of Tres Marias, a thinly populated
area off the main road.

When a vehicle containing Federal Police approached and its occupants
brandished their weapons, the driver of the diplomatic vehicle tried to evade
them and return to the main highway. At that point, the police sprayed bullets
into the black SUV with diplomatic plates.

Moments later, three other vehicles carrying Federal Police joined the attack,
also shooting at the U.S. Embassy vehicle.

By now, the Mexican who was in the embassy vehicle had contacted personnel at a
nearby military installation, who arrived after the firing had ended and
cordoned off the site.

Both embassy employees were taken -- under Federal Police guard -- to a
hospital.

Photographs of the SUV showed the embassy vehicle pockmarked with more than a
dozen holes and at least three of its tires flat.

The Federal Police officers involved were being questioned by authorities to
establish what happened. They may be prosecuted.

In a statement, the U.S. Embassy described the Mexican as a Navy captain and
said the three individuals were en route to a training facility when they were
ambushed.

"The vehicle attempted to escape, was pursued and sustained heavy damage," the
statement said. "They called for assistance from the Mexican armed forces, who
responded. The two U.S. wounded personnel were taken from the scene, given
medical treatment and are in stable condition. The Mexican Navy captain
sustained no serious injuries."

The Mexican government said those members of the Federal Police who fired on
the vehicle have been detained, the statement said.

It added that the Mexican government "has stated it will conduct a full and
thorough investigation of this incident."

Court Rules Israel Is Not at Fault in American Activist's Death

http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/world/middleeast/court-rules-israel-wasnt-at-
fault-in-rachel-corries-death.html?_r=2&hp
By JODI RUDOREN and DANIELLE ZIRI

JERUSALEM -- An Israeli judge ruled on Tuesday that the state bore no
responsibility for the death of Rachel Corrie, the young American woman who was
run over by a military bulldozer in 2003 as she protested the demolition of
Palestinian homes in the Gaza Strip.

The lengthy verdict in the civil case, read in part to a courtroom in Haifa
packed with supporters of Ms. Corrie's family, called the death a "regrettable
accident" -- a characterization that Ms. Corrie's allies strongly disputed.

"She chose to put herself in danger," said the judge, Oded Gershon. "She could
have easily distanced herself from the danger like any reasonable person
would."

Since her death, Ms. Corrie has become an international symbol of the
Palestinian resistance. A play based on her writings has been performed in 10
countries, and a ship in an attempted aid flotilla to Gaza bore her name.
Books, documentaries and songs have recounted how Ms. Corrie, a 23-year-old
student, dressed in an orange vest and wielding a bullhorn stood between a
bulldozer and the home of a Palestinian family in March 2003 during the height
of the second intifada, or uprising.

Hussein Abu Hussein, the lawyer who brought the wrongful-death suit on the
Corrie family's behalf, said he would appeal the ruling within 45 days to
Israel's Supreme Court. At a news conference after the verdict, he showed
pictures of Ms. Corrie taken the day of her death, saying "anyone could have
seen" her bright garb.

"It's a black day for activists of human rights and people who believe in
values of dignity," Mr. Hussein said. "We believe this decision is a bad
decision for all of us -- civilians first of all, and peace activists."

In his ruling, Judge Gershon said the military's mission that day "was not, in
any way, to destroy homes," but to clear brush and explosives "to prevent acts
of hatred and terror." He said the bulldozer was moving slowly, about 1
kilometer per hour, and that the driver could not have seen Ms. Corrie, finding
"no base to the plaintiff's claim that the bulldozer hit her on purpose."

Mark Regev, a spokesman for the Israeli prime minister, called the verdict a
"vindication" of the nation's military and court systems.

"I empathize for the family, they've lost a loved one, who as the judge said
was killed in a tragic accident," Mr. Regev said. "But the charges that the
Israeli courts are not independent, impartial, and hold the highest
professional standards are simply without foundation."

Ms. Corrie, a student at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., joined the
International Solidarity Movement in January, 2003, and spent the last weeks of
her life in Rafah, the Gaza town that borders Egypt. In a Feb. 27, 2003, e-mail
home, she wrote that 600 homes had been destroyed there since the start of the
intifada. On March 16 she and seven other American and British activists acted
as human shields, dropping to their knees between the bulldozers and a home
they believed were marked for destruction. The verdict came more than a year
after the last of 15 sessions of oral testimony, which began in March 2010.
Some of the witnesses, including the drivers and commanders of two bulldozers
that were operating in the area that day, testified from behind a screen to
protect their identities. Ms. Corrie's parents or sister attended every session
of the trial, spending about $200,000 on travel, translating about 2,000 pages
of documents, and other expenses.

"A lawsuit is not a substitute for a legal investigation, which we never had,"
Ms. Corrie's mother, Cindy Corrie, said at Tuesday's news conference. "The
diplomatic process between the United States and Israel failed us." The United
States Embassy, which sent a representative to the oral-testimony sessions,
declined to comment on the verdict. In June 2004, a representative of the
secretary of state wrote to the Corrie family saying the United States agreed
with them that the military's investigation was not "thorough, credible and
transparent."

In Washington, the State Department's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said, "We
understand the family's disappointment with the outcome of the trial," and
noted that American diplomats "have worked with the family all through this
process" and that they would continue to do so. She declined to discuss the
remarks that Ms. Corrie's family attributed to the American ambassador that the
Israeli investigation had not been transparent.

But on Tuesday, Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's executive committee, said in a statement that the United States
government "has been noticeably absent, and its silence is deafening," calling
Washington "complicit in compounding the crime." She also said that the trial
had revealed "overwhelming proof that Rachel was deliberately murdered" and
said that "Palestinians as a whole will continue to love Rachel and cherish her
memory."

Sarah Corrie Simpson, who has met with more than 200 Congressional offices in
Washington about the case, said she remained convinced that the driver of the
bulldozer saw her younger sister. "I hope someday he will have the courage to
sit down in front of me and tell me what he saw and what he feels," Ms. Simpson
said.

In an interview before the verdict, Ms. Corrie's father, Craig Corrie, said,
"You don't really close a wound like this, but it certainly is a big
milestone." At meetings across Israel over the past week, Mr. Corrie carried
with him a picture not of his daughter but of the Palestinian girl, then 6,
whose family's house was behind Ms. Corrie when she was killed.

"I think this one in some ways is more hopeful," he said of the picture. "She
deserves a future that we all want for our children."

Non-addictive, 'heroin-like' medicine may soon crush major depression
By Dr. Keith Ablow

The Mind of the News

Published August 29, 2012

http://www.foxnews.com/health/2012/08/29/non-addictive-heroin-like-medicine-may
-soon-crush-major-depression/?intcmp=obnetwork

What could easily be the most important advance in the pharmacologic treatment
of major depression and anxiety disorders is now unfolding.

A new investigational drug, currently known as ALKS 5461, could deliver all the
mood-enhancing and anxiety-lowering effects that lead people to use opiates
like heroin and Oxycontin - without the potential for getting high or addicted.
 That's right:  ALKS 5461 could be a non-abusable, non-addictive heroin-like
compound.

ALKS 5461 is actually a combination of two molecules.  The first is
buprenorphine, which is already used to provide some of the benefits of
opiates, without many of the worst side effects, allowing people to get off of
street drugs (as an alternative to methadone).  The second molecule is now
known as ALKS 33 - and that's the magic part.

ALKS 33 interferes with the binding of buprenorphine to the receptors that are
involved in making people feel euphoric.  Those are the receptors also involved
in getting people to crave opiates like alcoholics crave alcohol.

In a double-blind, placebo controlled study (meaning, the participants had no
idea whether they were getting ALKS 5461 or a sugar pill), ALKS 5461 was
rapidly effective in relieving symptoms in 32 patients with major depression.
All 32 patients responded to the medicine - with results evident by seven days.

What's more, all of them had failed to respond adequately to traditional
antidepressants like Prozac or Effexor.

Ultimately, I believe ALKS 5461 could revolutionize the pharmacologic treatment
of major depression and panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder and
obsessive-compulsive disorder.

It should come as no surprise that ALKS 5461 is the brainchild of scientists at
Alkermes Pharmaceuticals, the same company, which invented and markets
Vivitrol, a monthly injection that can take away the "high" of using alcohol
and street drugs - and in my opinion, ought to be something that every family
member of every addict clamors to get their loved one to take.

If ALKS 5461 comes to market (and I believe it will), then that scourge we call
major depression will be dealt a massive blow.  It will still be imperative to
use insight-oriented psychotherapy to get to the bottom of what unique
psychological issues have fueled each person's depression, but that should be
easier - not harder - when folks aren't struggling just to get out of bed and
over to their psychiatrists' offices.

This is a really big deal.

Why you should be worried about facial-recognition technology

http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57502284-93/why-you-should-be-worried-about-fa
cial-recognition-technology/

Germany has issued an ultimatum to Facebook over privacy violations. Law
enforcement is interested in this sort of technology, as well. It's time for
you to pay attention to what they're doing.

by Violet Blue
August 29, 2012 1:58 PM PDT

It could be time for you to start worrying about what Facebook might be doing
with the identity information collected on you and "tagged" photos.

The Hamburg Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information in
Germany has announced legal action against the company and charged that
Facebook's use of facial-recognition technology is illegal.

In addition, the Federation of German Consumer Organizations is ordering
Facebook to stop giving third-party applications users' data without their
consent.

If the social network doesn't do this by Sept. 4, the FGCO will sue. Earlier
this month, Norway also announced that it is looking into the legality of the
social network's use of face-matching technology.

Unlike the United States, Germany has regulations that allow Internet users
control over their data.

Regarding photo tags, a Facebook spokesperson told CNET: "We believe that the
photo tag suggest feature on Facebook is fully compliant with EU data
protection laws. During our continuous dialogue with our supervisory authority
in Europe, the Office of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner we agreed to
develop a best practice solution to notify people on Facebook about photo tag
suggest."


Facebook: facial recognition profiles without user consent

A number of companies - like Facebook, Apple and Google - have facial
recognition or detection as an automatic part of various services and apps.

With Apple and Google, users must opt-in, and they can opt-out. While its users
can remove tags, Facebook's facial recognition feature is active by default.

But what happens with that information? It's not just that Facebook is using
facial recognition (biometric data) to increase the worth of its data for sale,
trade, or for whatever currency it's lining litterboxes with in Menlo Park.
In its December 2011 comments the Electronic Privacy Information Center told
the Federal Trade Commission:

(...) the Commission should specifically prohibit the use of Facebook's
biometric image database by any law enforcement agency in the world, absent a
showing of adequate legal process, consistent with international human rights
norms.

Facebook reportedly possessed an estimated 60 billion photos by late 2010, and
approximately 2.5 billion photos are uploaded to Facebook each month.


The democratization of surveillance

EPIC's comments came after the FTC held a day-long forum called "Face Facts: A
Forum on Facial Recognition Technology," focusing on the commercial
applications of facial recognition technology and its potential privacy
implications.

The "Face Facts" participants came from disparate sides of the discussion. They
included FTC attorneys, the Face.com CEO, Facebook's senior privacy advisor and
director, and reps from Google, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, the Center
for Democracy and Technology and the ACLU.

Demos were done for participants by Intel AIM Suite (Audience Impression
Metrics: a CMS-friendly and API-ready, public-use face detection software
product) and Andrew Cummins, self-described strategy expert in tech/defense
markets and the chief technology officer of controversial app-maker SceneTap.

There was also a representative from the National Institute of Standards and
Technology. Interestingly, in 2010 NIST tested various facial recognition
systems and found that the best algorithm correctly recognized 92 percent of
unknown individuals from a database of 1.6 million criminal records.

FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz opened "Face Facts" saying this summit was timely
because, "Facebook has launched new facial recognition technology" and that
"These sorts of technologies have already taken hold in law enforcement and the
military; in that area, they are as controversial as they are interesting."

I'm not sure if his use of a clip from the Tom Cruise film Minority Report in
his opening remarks was meant to be ironic or not. Perhaps Mr. Leibowitz misses
working for the MPAA (where he was chief lobbyist until being tapped for the
FTC by George W. Bush in 2004).

Leibowitz did say, "We must confront openly the real possibility that these
technologies, if not now, then soon, may be able to put a name with the face,
so to speak, and have an impact on our careers, credit, health, and families."

The Face Facts meeting raised an alarm for privacy organizations; Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse director Beth Givens stated outright that there is
insufficient public awareness about all aspects of facial recognition tech, and
zero auditing mechanisms in place for any entity using the technologies.

Six months after the FTC meeting, Facebook acquired one of the biz-dev side
participants, Face.com.

It's clear that after meetings and summits, even with good intentions for
privacy protections, regulators like the FTC are merely only still on the
outside looking in.


Ties between video profiling in private and government sectors more murky than
ever

Back in July at a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing Senator Al Franken
said, "Facebook may have created the world's largest privately held database of
face prints without the explicit knowledge of its users."

Franken continued to link the holes in citizen protections and stressed
implications with the then-new Federal Bureau of Investigation
facial-recognition pilot program.

Franken stated that any law-enforcement gains from the program could come at a
high cost to civil liberties. "The FBI pilot could be abused to not only
identify protesters at political events and rallies, but to target them for
selective jailing and prosecution, stifling their First Amendment rights," he
said.

Think about the implications of facial recognition profiles on social media
sites along with current trends in cybersecurity legislation hysteria.

Remember CISPA? The surveillance bill would have given Homeland Security a
backdoor pass to access your email, private information and social network data
without a warrant or notice if it fit into a plan to stop "cybersecurity"
threats. CISPA would have made it so that Facebook would be completely
unrestricted (say, by your rights) to cooperate with Homeland Security to the
fullest extent.

Just in the past few weeks, information has surfaced from a Wikileaks leak of
private intelligence documents that the purpose of a surveillance product
called TrapWire is to combine various intelligent surveillance technologies
with tracking and location data, individual profile histories from various
sources (datamining and social media), and image data analysis (such as facial
recognition; TrapWire's video component) to monitor people under the guise of
threat detection.

TrapWire is a commercial product sold to and implemented by private entities,
the US Government "and its allies overseas."


Too little FTC, too late?

Facial recognition technologies are no longer held back from commercial sectors
by high costs and poor accuracy and are quickly becoming directed at recording
faces in public places and business establishments, rather than only online.

The FTC had impressed the point that the avenue of interest for "Face Facts"
would solely address commercial uses and does not address the use of facial
recognition technologies for security purposes or by law enforcement or
government actors.

Right now there is nothing that requires any private entity to provide the
individual with notice that facial recognition information is being collected,
or the duration of the period in which the information will stored, or used.

There is nothing preventing private entities (businesses, app developers, data
brokers or advertisers) from selling, trading, or otherwise profiting from an
individual's biometric information - or from disclosing or disseminating the
information without obtaining the individual's consent or pursuant to a valid
warrant or subpoena.

It will be interesting to see how Facebook handles its newest privacy problem
in Germany.

Actor Michael Clarke Duncan passed away today at age 54. Clarke suffered a
heart attack on July 13th, from which he never recovered. He was being
treated at Cedars-Siani Medical Center in Los Angeles, CA.

Following his mother's advice against playing football, the 6'5", 300 lb.
youth from Chicago instead turned to acting. After dropping out of college
to support his ill mother, he turned to bouncing. Later he would move to
Los Angeles where he became a renowned bodyguard for celebrities such as
Will Smith and Jamie Foxx. However, it was his final assignment that he
declined to accept, protecting rapper Notorious B.I.G. on the night he
was murdered, that lead him to give up being a bodyguard and to pursue
acting full-time.

Typecast as a bodyguard or bouncer under the name "Big Mike" Duncan, he
eventually broke through in the 1998 Bruce Willis blockbuster "Armageddon".
After that, Willis suggested Clarke to play the breakout role of prisoner
John Coffey in "The Green Mile", staring Tom Hanks in 1999. After portraying
DC villian "the Kingpen" Wilson Fisk in 2003's "Daredevil", a follow-up
opportunity to protray the character's voice in the 2003 "Spider-Man"
animated TV series brought him plenty of work as a voice-over artist in
cartoons and video games.

Duncan was engaged to actress and reality TV star Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth.

FILE - U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens stands in the lobby of the Tibesty Hotel

Benghazi, Libya in this April 11, 2011 file photo. Libyan officials say the
U.S. ambassador and three other Americans have been killed in an attack on the
U.S. consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi by protesters angry over a film
that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad.


US investigates: Attacks coordinated to mark 9/11?

By MATTHEW LEE
Associated Press
Published: Wednesday, Sep. 12, 2012 - 4:48 am
Last Modified: Wednesday, Sep. 12, 2012 - 6:44 pm
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration, roiled by the first killing of a U.S.
ambassador in more than 30 years, is investigating whether the assault on the
U.S. Consulate in Libya was a planned terrorist strike to mark the anniversary
of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and not a spontaneous mob enraged over an
anti-Islam YouTube video.
President Barack Obama declared in a White House appearance that the U.S. would
"work with the Libyan government to bring to justice" those who killed
Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans. The attack on the Benghazi
consulate was "a planned, coordinated, well-executed military style event,"
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said.
In a show of force, the Pentagon moved two warships to the Libyan coast.
Officials said one destroyer, the USS Laboon, moved to a position off the coast
Wednesday, and the destroyer USS McFaul was en route and should be stationed
off the coast within days, increasing the number of Navy destroyers in the
Mediterranean from four to five.
Officials said the ships, which carry Tomahawk cruise missiles, do not have a
specific mission. But they give commanders flexibility to respond to any
mission ordered by the president.
Pentagon spokesman George Little said, "Without commenting on specific ship
movements, the United States military regularly takes precautionary steps when
potential contingencies might arise in a given situation. That's not only
logical in certain circumstances, it's the prudent thing to do."
At the same time, some 50 U.S. Marines headed to Libya to reinforce security at
U.S. diplomatic facilities, initially at the American embassy in Tripoli, not
Benghazi.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized
to publicly discuss troop movements.
White House press secretary Jay Carney said it was too early to judge whether
the Benghazi attack was planned.
"I know that this is being investigated, and we're working with the Libyan
government to investigate the incident. I would not want to speculate on that
at this time," he said. Several Libyan security guards also were killed.
Rogers, R-Mich., said U.S. intelligence had not yet determined who was
responsible, but added, "Our list is narrowing."
"When you see (such an attack), it wasn't some folks who had some guns in their
garage and said let's shoot up the consulate," Rogers said in an interview
Wednesday.
The FBI was sending evidence teams to Libya, said a law enforcement official.
Analysts are working on several different scenarios based on intelligence that
could lead to a motive for the attack. Some concern the possibility of
targeting high-ranking officials, according to a law enforcement official
briefed on the investigation. But none of the intelligence has suggested
terrorists would specifically target Stevens, said the official who also spoke
on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about
the investigation.
The attack in Libya, which came hours after a mob stormed the U.S. Embassy in
Cairo and tore down the U.S. flag, was presumed to have been triggered by a
movie, whose trailer has gone viral on YouTube, depicting the Islamic prophet
Muhammad in disrespectful ways. In an extraordinary move, Gen. Martin Dempsey,
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, called anti-Islamic preacher Terry
Jones and asked him to stop promoting the film. A spokeswoman said the church
would not show the film Wednesday evening.
"Make no mistake. Justice will be done," a somber Obama pledged at the White
House, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton at his side.
He ordered increased security at U.S. diplomatic missions overseas,
particularly in Libya, and said he condemned "in the strongest possible terms
the outrageous and shocking" attack. Clinton said she was particularly appalled
that the attack took place in Benghazi, which the U.S. had helped liberate from
dictator Moammar Gadhafi during the Arab Spring revolution in Libya last year.
Three Americans were wounded, U.S. officials said.
The aftermath of the two attacks also stirred the U.S. presidential campaign,
where until Wednesday, foreign policy had taken a back seat to the struggling
economy.
The Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, criticized the administration for
statements issued before and after the Cairo attacks that expressed sympathy
for those insulted by the video. But he in turn was criticized for turning a
tragedy too quickly into political fodder, and getting key details wrong. And
his account didn't mesh completely with events in Cairo.
The embassy statement that he referred to as akin to an apology was issued at
midday on Tuesday in Cairo at a time the embassy staff was aware of
still-peaceful demonstrations in the area nearby. It was four or five hours
later when the mob breached the compound's walls and tried to burn a U.S. flag.
Obama told CBS' "60 Minutes" that Romney "seems to have a tendency to shoot
first and aim later."
Obama and Clinton made a rare joint visit to the State Department, where
grieving colleagues of Stevens and the other three Americans killed in Benghazi
gathered in a courtyard. The president also ordered U.S. flags to be flown at
half-staff at government and military buildings and vessels around the world
until sunset on Sept. 16. Flags had already been lowered in many places to
commemorate the victims of the 9/11 attacks.
Clinton denounced those who might kill over an insulting movie.
"There is no justification for this," Clinton said. "None. Violence like this
is no way to honor religion or faith and as long as there are those who would
take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a true and
lasting peace."
Underscoring the administration's frustration, Clinton wondered aloud about the
attack in Benghazi, which Gadhafi had once threatened to destroy.
"This is not easy," she said. "Today, many Americans are asking, indeed I asked
myself, how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped
liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction? This question reflects
just how complicated and, at times, just how confounding, the world can be."
"But we must be clear-eyed in our grief," she said, saying the attack was
carried out by a "small and savage group" not representative of the Libyan
people. She noted that Libyan security guards had tried to fight off the
attackers, had carried Stevens' body to the hospital and led other consulate
employees to safety.
Stevens, a 52-year-old career diplomat, was killed after he became separated
from other American officials during the consulate attack. It's unclear when he
died: He was taken by Libyans to a hospital, and his remains were delivered
hours later to U.S. officials at the Benghazi airport.
Stevens is the first U.S. ambassador to be killed in an attack since 1979, when
Ambassador Adolph Dubs was killed in Afghanistan.
Three other Americans were also killed and the State Department identified one
of them as Sean Smith, an Air Force veteran who had worked as an information
management officer for 10 years in posts such as Brussels, Baghdad and
Pretoria. Smith was also well-known in the video game community.
The identities of the others were being withheld pending notification of
relatives.
"The mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both
noble and necessary, and we and the people of Libya honor their memory by
carrying it forward," Clinton said.
Stevens spoke Arabic and French and had already served two tours in Libya,
including running the office in Benghazi during the revolt against Gadhafi. He
was confirmed as ambassador to Libya by the Senate earlier this year.

Foxconn China plant closed after worker disturbance

http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/24/us-hon-hai-idUSBRE88N00L20120924

(Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group closed its Taiyuan plant in
northern China on Monday after a brawl involving possibly thousands of workers
began in dormitory facilities early in the morning.

The Taiyuan plant, which employs about 79,000 workers, makes parts for
automotive electronics and assembles various electronic devices, according to
Foxconn spokesman Louis Woo.

"The fight is over now ... we're still investigating the cause of the fight and
the number of workers involved," said Woo, adding that "involving a couple
thousand workers is possible".

Woo said the fight happened in the workers' dormitory facilities and said the
company would issue a statement later on Monday.

China's Xinhuanet.com, operated by the Xinhua News Agency, said about 10 people
were hurt in the fighting, citing police.

Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co and the world's
largest contract maker of electronic goods, has seen a few violent disputes at
its sprawling plants in China, where it employs a total of about 1 million
workers.

By late morning, Hon Hai shares were down 1.14 percent, lagging the broader
market's decline of 0.28 percent.

In June, about 100 workers went on a rampage at a Chengdu plant in southwestern
China. The company has faced allegations of poor conditions and mistreatment of
workers at its China operations, and has been spending heavily in recent months
to improve the work environment and to raise wages.

A staff member at the Taiyuan plant said he was told the plant could be closed
up to two to three days for police investigations.

"There are a lot of police at the site now," the staff member, who asked not to
be named because he is not authorized to speak to media, told Reuters by
telephone.

He said the plant also makes parts and assemble Apple's iPhone 5.

Calls to the Taiyuan police were not immediately answered, while an official at
the plant declined to comment when reached by telephone.

George McGovern dies; lost 1972 presidential bid
By KRISTI EATON and WALTER R. MEARS
Associated Press
Published: Sunday, Oct. 21, 2012 - 4:42 am
Last Modified: Sunday, Oct. 21, 2012 - 8:51 am
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- George McGovern once joked that he had wanted to run for
president in the worst way - and that he had done so.

It was a campaign in 1972 dishonored by Watergate, a scandal that fully
unfurled too late to knock Republican President Richard M. Nixon from his place
as a commanding favorite for re-election. The South Dakota senator tried to
make an issue out of the bungled attempt to wiretap the offices of the
Democratic National Committee, calling Nixon the most corrupt president in
history.

But the Democrat could not escape the embarrassing missteps of his own
campaign. The most torturous was the selection of Missouri Sen. Thomas F.
Eagleton as the vice presidential nominee and, 18 days later, following the
disclosure that Eagleton had undergone electroshock therapy for depression, the
decision to drop him from the ticket despite having pledged to back him "1,000
percent."

It was at once the most memorable and the most damaging line of his campaign,
and called "possibly the most single damaging faux pas ever made by a
presidential candidate" by the late political writer Theodore H. White.

After a hard day's campaigning - Nixon did virtually none - McGovern would
complain to those around him that nobody was paying attention. With R. Sargent
Shriver as his running mate, he went on to carry only Massachusetts and the
District of Columbia, winning just 38 percent of the popular vote in one of the
biggest landslides losses in American presidential history.

"Tom and I ran into a little snag back in 1972 that in the light of my much
advanced wisdom today, I think was vastly exaggerated," McGovern said at an
event with Eagleton in 2005. Noting that Nixon and his running mate, Spiro
Agnew, would both ultimately resign, he joked, "If we had run in '74 instead of
'72, it would have been a piece of cake."

A proud liberal who had argued fervently against Vietnam War as a Democratic
senator from South Dakota and three-time candidate for president, McGovern died
at 5:15 a.m. Sunday at a Sioux Falls hospice, family spokesman Steve Hildebrand
told The Associated Press. McGovern was 90.

McGovern's family had said late last week that McGovern had become unresponsive
while in hospice care, and Hildebrand said he was surrounded by family and
lifelong friends when he died.

"We are blessed to know that our father lived a long, successful and productive
life advocating for the hungry, being a progressive voice for millions and
fighting for peace. He continued giving speeches, writing and advising all the
way up to and past his 90th birthday, which he celebrated this summer," the
family said in the statement.

A funeral will be held in Sioux Falls, with details announced shortly,
Hildebrand said.

A decorated World War II bomber pilot, McGovern said he learned to hate war by
waging it. In his disastrous race against Nixon, he promised to end the Vietnam
War and cut defense spending by billions of dollars. He helped create the Food
for Peace program and spent much of his career believing the United States
should be more accommodating to the former Soviet Union.

Never a showman, he made his case with a style as plain as the prairies where
he grew up, sounding often more like the Methodist minister he'd once studied
to become than longtime U.S. senator and three-time candidate for president he
became.

And he never shied from the word "liberal," even as other Democrats blanched at
the word and Republicans used it as an epithet.

"I am a liberal and always have been," McGovern said in 2001. "Just not the
wild-eyed character the Republicans made me out to be."

McGovern's campaign, nevertheless, left a lasting imprint on American politics.
Determined not to make the same mistake, presidential nominees have since
interviewed and intensely investigated their choices for vice president. Former
President Bill Clinton got his start in politics when he signed on as a
campaign worker for McGovern in 1972 and is among the legion of Democrats who
credit him with inspiring them to public service.

"I believe no other presidential candidate ever has had such an enduring impact
in defeat," Clinton said in 2006 at the dedication of McGovern's library in
Mitchell, S.D. "Senator, the fires you lit then still burn in countless
hearts."

George Stanley McGovern was born on July 19, 1922, in the small farm town of
Avon, S.D, the son of a Methodist pastor. He was raised in Mitchell, shy and
quiet until he was recruited for the high school debate team and found his
niche. He enrolled at Dakota Wesleyan University in his hometown and, already a
private pilot, volunteered for the Army Air Force soon after the Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor.

The Army didn't have enough airfields or training planes to take him until
1943. He married his wife, Eleanor Stegeberg, and arrived in Italy the next
year. That would be his base for the 35 missions he flew in the B-24 Liberator
christened the "Dakota Queen" after his new bride.

In a December 1944 bombing raid on the Czech city of Pilsen, McGovern's plane
was hit by anti-aircraft fire that disabled one engine and set fire to another.
He nursed the B-24 back to a British airfield on an island in the Adriatic Sea,
earning the Distinguished Flying Cross. On his final mission, his plane was hit
several times, but he managed to get it back safety - one of the actions for
which he received the Air Medal.

McGovern returned to Mitchell and graduated from Dakota Wesleyan after the
war's end, and after a year of divinity school, switched to the study of
history and political science at Northwestern University. He earned his
master's and doctoral degrees, returned to Dakota Wesleyan to teach history and
government, and switched from his family's Republican roots to the Democratic
Party.

"I think it was my study of history that convinced me that the Democratic Party
was more on the side of the average American," he said.

In the early 1950s, Democrats held no major offices in South Dakota and only a
handful of legislative seats. McGovern, who had gotten into Democratic politics
as a campaign volunteer, left teaching in 1953 to become executive secretary of
the South Dakota Democratic Party. Three years later, he won an upset election
to the House; he served two terms and left to run for Senate.

Challenging conservative Republican Sen. Karl Mundt in 1960, he lost what he
called his "worst campaign." He said later that he'd hated Mundt so much that
he'd lost his sense of balance.

President John F. Kennedy named McGovern head of the Food for Peace program,
which sends U.S. commodities to deprived areas around the world. He made a
second Senate bid in 1962, unseating Sen. Joe Bottum by just 597 votes. He was
the first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate from South Dakota since 1930.

In his first year in office, McGovern took to the Senate floor to say that the
Vietnam war was a trap that would haunt the United States - a speech that drew
little notice. He voted the following August in favor of the Gulf of Tonkin
resolution under which President Lyndon B. Johnson escalated the U.S. war in
the southeast Asian nation.

While McGovern continued to vote to pay for the war, he did so while speaking
against it. As the war escalated, so did his opposition. Late in 1969, McGovern
called for a cease-fire in Vietnam and the withdrawal of all U.S. troops within
a year. He later co-sponsored a Senate amendment to cut off appropriations for
the war by the end of 1971. It failed, but not before McGovern had taken the
floor to declare "this chamber reeks of blood" and to demand an end to "this
damnable war."

McGovern first sought the Democratic presidential nomination late in the 1968
campaign, saying he would take up the cause of the assassinated Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy. He finished far behind Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, who won the
nomination, and Minnesota Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who had led the anti-war
challenge to Johnson in the primaries earlier in the year. McGovern later
called his bid an "anti-organization" effort against the Humphrey steamroller.

"At least I have precluded the possibility of peaking too early," McGovern
quipped at the time.

The following year, McGovern led a Democratic Party reform commission that
shifted to voters' power that had been wielded by party leaders and bosses at
the national conventions. The result was the system of presidential primary
elections and caucuses that now selects the Democratic and Republican
presidential nominees.

In 1972, McGovern ran under the rules he had helped write. Initially considered
a longshot against Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine, McGovern built a bottom-up
campaign organization and went to the Democratic national convention in
command. He was the first candidate to gain a nominating majority in the
primaries before the convention.

It was a meeting filled with intramural wrangling and speeches that verged on
filibusters. By the time McGovern delivered his climactic speech accepting the
nomination, it was 2:48 a.m., and with most of America asleep, he lost his last
and best chance to make his case to a nationwide audience.

McGovern did not know before selecting Eagleton of his running mate's mental
health woes, and after dropping him from the ticket, struggled to find a
replacement. Several Democrats said no, and a joke made the rounds that there
was a signup sheet in the Senate cloakroom. Shriver, a member of the Kennedy
family, finally agreed.

The campaign limped into the fall on a platform advocating withdrawal from
Vietnam in exchange for the release of POWs, cutting defense spending by a
third and establishing an income floor for all Americans. McGovern had dropped
an early proposal to give every American $1,000 a year, but the Republicans
continued to ridicule it as "the demogrant." They painted McGovern as an
extreme leftist and Democrats as the party of "amnesty, abortion and acid."

While McGovern said little about his decorated service in World War II,
Republicans depicted him as a weak peace activist. At one point, McGovern was
forced to defend himself against assertions he had shirked combat.

He'd had enough when a young man at the airport fence in Battle Creek, Mich.,
taunted that Nixon would clobber him. McGovern leaned in and said quietly:
"I've got a secret for you. Kiss my ass." A conservative Senate colleague later
told McGovern it was his best line of the campaign.

Defeated by Nixon, McGovern returned to the Senate and pressed there to end the
Vietnam war while championing agriculture, anti-hunger and food stamp programs
in the United States and food programs abroad. He won re-election to the Senate
in 1974, by which point he could make wry jokes about his presidential defeat.

"For many years, I wanted to run for the presidency in the worst possible way -
and last year, I sure did," he told a formal press dinner in Washington.

After losing his bid for a fourth Senate term in the 1980 Republican landslide
that made Ronald Reagan president, McGovern went on to teach and lecture at
universities, and found a liberal political action committee. He made a
longshot bid in the 1984 presidential race with a call to end U.S. military
involvement in Lebanon and Central America and open arms talks with the
Soviets. Former Vice President Walter Mondale won the Democratic nomination and
went on to lose to President Ronald Reagan by an even bigger margin in
electoral votes than had McGovern to Nixon.

He talked of running a final time for president in 1992, but decided it was
time for somebody younger and with fewer political scars.

After his career in office ended, McGovern served as U.S. ambassador to the
Rome-based United Nation's food agencies from 1998 to 2001 and spent his later
years working to feed needy children around the world. He and former Republican
Sen. Bob Dole collaborated to create an international food for education and
child nutrition program, for which they shared the 2008 World Food Prize.

Clinton and his wife, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said in a
statement Sunday that while McGovern was "a tireless advocate for human rights
and dignity," his greatest passion was helping feed the hungry.

"The programs he created helped feed millions of people, including food stamps
in the 1960s and the international school feeding program in the 90's, both of
which he co-sponsored with Senator Bob Dole," they said, adding, "We must
continue to draw inspiration from his example and build the world he fought
for."

McGovern's opposition to armed conflict remained a constant long after he
retired. Shortly before Iowa's caucuses in 2004, McGovern endorsed retired Gen.
Wesley Clark, and compared his own opposition to the Vietnam War to Clark's
criticism of President George W. Bush's decision to wage war in Iraq. One of
the 10 books McGovern wrote was 2006's "Out of Iraq: A Practical Plan for
Withdrawal Now," written with William R. Polk.

In early 2002, George and Eleanor McGovern returned to Mitchell, where they
helped raise money for a library bearing their names. Eleanor McGovern died
there in 2007 at age 85; they had been married 64 years, and had four daughters
and a son.

"I don't know what kind of president I would have been, but Eleanor would have
been a great first lady," he said after his wife's death in 2007.

SSRI Antidepressents Associated with Risk of Bleeding in the Brain

October 18, 2012 By Lillian Chan

http://www.publichealthwatchdog.com/ssri-antidepressents-associated-with-risk-
of-bleeding-in-the-brain/

People who take a common class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may have a higher risk of hemorrhagic stroke, or
bleeding in the brain. According to a new study published in the journal
Neurology, SSRI users may be 40 to 50 percent more likely to experience brain
bleeds. SSRIs are already associated with a number of side effects, many of
which include birth defects.

Bleeding Risks

On Wednesday, the journal Neurology published a study showing that the risk of
hemorrhagic strokes, which includes bleeding that occurs in and around the
brain. After pooling data from 16 previous studies involving over 500,000
people, researchers concluded that "SSRI exposure is associated with an
increased risk of intracerebral and intracranial hemorrhage, yet given the
rarity of this event, absolute risks are likely to be very low." SSRI users
were found to be 40 to 50 percent more likely to suffer from this event.

The study is correlational, meaning that it does not indicate whether or not
the bleeding was caused by the antidepressants, only that this event seems to
occur more often in these patients. Researchers acknowledged the possibility
that the results might be due to some outside factor. However, they also said
that there is a biological basis for believing that drugs caused the brain
bleeds; SSRIs can disturb platelet activity, which may interfere with the
blood's clotting ability. SSRIs have already been linked to stomach bleeds in
previous studies.

SSRI Side Effects

SSRIs, such as Paxil, Prozac or Zoloft, are associated with a number of other
side effects, including birth defects. Research has linked the antidepressants
to oral defects such as cleft lip and cleft palate, as well as cardiac defects.
More recently, studies have found that newborns who were exposed to SSRIs
during pregnancy may be more likely to develop persistent pulmonary
hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), a potentially fatal respiratory disorder.

(RNN) - The U.S. Coast Guard reported an oil platform off the coast of
Louisiana caught fire Friday, according to multiple news outlets.

The rig is owned by Black Elk Energy. Kirk Trascher, Black Elk asset manager,
told WAFB they "cannot confirm or deny anything at this time."

"We are assembling an incident command team right now," Trascher said.

KHOU reported two people were killed, two more were missing and four were
injured. No word on if any oil has been spilled into the Gulf of Mexico.

Jefferson Parish, LA, Councilman Chris Roberts told WWL the facility is a
shallow water platform in West Delta Block 32.

It is located about 20 miles south of Grand Isle, LA. The USCG activated a
command center to investigate.

The U.S. Supreme Court agreed Friday to take its first serious look at the
issue of gay marriage, granting review of California's ban on same-sex marriage
and of a federal law that defines marriage as only the legal union of a man and
a woman.

At the very least, the court will look at this question: When states choose to
permit the marriages of same-sex couples, can the federal government refuse to
recognize their validity?  But by also taking up the California case, the court
could get to the more fundamental question of whether the states must permit
marriages by gay people in the first place.

The California case involves a challenge to Proposition 8, a constitutional
amendment approved by 52 percent of voters in 2008.  It banned same-sex
marriages in the state and went into effect after 18,000 couples were legally
married earlier that year.

A federal judge declared the ban unconstitutional, and a federal appeals court
upheld that ruling, though on narrower grounds that apply only to California. 
Now that the Supreme Court is wading into the battle, the justices could decide
the more basic issue of whether any state can ban same-sex marriage under the
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the law.  Or they could limit
their ruling to apply only to the ban in California.

'contribute' button

Nine states and the District of Columbia have moved to permit same-sex marriage
or soon will -- Connecticut, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New York, Vermont, and Washington.

The Supreme Court also agreed Friday to hear a challenge to the federal Defense
of Marriage Act, known as DOMA, passed by overwhelming margins in both houses
of Congress in 1996 and signed by President Clinton.  A provision of the law
specifies that, for federal purposes, "the word 'marriage' means only a legal
union between one man and one woman as husband and wife."

Congress acted out of concern that a 1993 state court decision in Hawaii, which
held that the state could not deny marriage licenses to same sex couples, might
force other states to recognize gay marriage.  As it turned out, Hawaii did not
adopt same-sex marriage.

Because of DOMA, gay couples who wed in the nine states where same-sex marriage
is permitted are considered legally married only under state law.  The federal
government is barred from recognizing their marriages.  As a result, they are
denied over 1,000 federal benefits that are available to traditional couples.

After first supporting DOMA in court, the Obama administration concluded last
year that it violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under
the law.

"We cannot defend the federal government poking its nose into what states are
doing and putting the thumb on the scale against same-sex couples," President
Obama said in explaining the change.

Gay married couples in five states filed lawsuits challenging DOMA as an
unconstitutional denial of their right to equal protection.  After the Obama
Justice Department declined to defend the law, House Republicans stepped in to
carry on the legal fight.

Defenders of DOMA argue that the law helps preserve traditional marriage.

"Unions of two men or two women are not the same thing as a marriage between a
man and a woman. And only marriage between a man and a woman can connect
children to their mother and father and their parents to the children," says
Brian Brown of the National Organization for Marriage.

A Supreme Court decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act would not,
by itself, require states to allow same-sex marriages.  But the federal
government would be required to recognize those marriages in the states where
they are legal.

The cases will be argued before the justices in March, with a decision expected
by late June.

Embattled U.N. envoy Susan Rice is dropping out of the running to be the next
secretary of state after months of criticism over her Benghazi comments, she
told NBC News on Thursday.

"If nominated, I am now convinced that the confirmation process would be
lengthy, disruptive and costly . to you and to our most pressing national and
international priorities," Rice wrote in a letter to President Obama, saying
she.s saddened by the partisan politics surrounding her prospects.

"That trade-off is simply not worth it to our country...Therefore, I
respectfully request that you no longer consider my candidacy at this time,"
she wrote in the letter obtained by NBC News.

Brian Williams will have an exclusive interview with Rice on tonight.s "Rock
Center With Brian Williams" at 10p/9c.

Rice had been viewed as one of the front-runners to replace Hillary Clinton as
the nation.s top foreign policy official.

She has been under intense fire from Republicans for initially characterizing
the Sept. 11 assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, as a
spur-of-the-moment response to a crude anti-Muslim film.

"What happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a spontaneous reaction to what
had just transpired hours before in Cairo, almost a copycat of the
demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course,
by the video," Rice said on NBC.s "Meet the Press" five days after the attack.

"Opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as this was unfolding.
They came with heavy weapons, which unfortunately are readily available in
post-revolutionary Libya, and it escalated into a much more violent episode."

As more details emerged suggesting it was a premeditated terrorist action, GOP
critics accused Rice of misleading the public at the height of the presidential
campaign.

She countered that she went with the best information available about the
attack, in which Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were
killed.

"I relied solely and squarely on the information provided to me by the
intelligence community. I made clear that the information was preliminary and
that our investigations would give us the definitive answers," she said on Nov.
21 at the United Nations.

By then, Obama had already expressed strong support for Rice, warning Sens.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) to stop slamming her and
vowing to block her confirmation.

"They should go after me," he said at his first press conference after his
re-election.

And last week, Clinton praised Rice as a "stalwart colleague" who had done a
"good job" at the U.N.

Children Were Each Shot Multiple Times

All of the children killed by a gunman at a Connecticut elementary school were
shot multiple times, according to the state's chief medical examiner, who said
that it was worst scene he had witnessed in three decades examining crime
scenes.

"This is a very devastating set of injuries," said Dr. H. Wayne Carver II, the
chief medical examiner for the state. He said that it appeared that all of the
children had been killed by a long rifle that the gunman was carrying, one of
several weapons police recovered from the school.

Dr. Carver said that parents were shown photos of their children to spare them
from seeing the gruesome results of the shooting rampage, which left 20
children dead, along with six adults at the school. The gunman, identified by
law enforcement officials as Adam Lanza, took his own life and also shot and
killed his mother at his home before going to the school. Dr. Carver said that
they had not yet completed examinations of Mr. Lanza and his mother.

Dr. Carver said that in the seven autopsies he himself had performed, the
victims had from 3 to 11 wounds.

Conservative judge Robert Bork died early Wednesday at the age of 85 at his
home in Virginia, two sources close to his family tell CNN today.

In 1987, President Ronald Reagan nominated Bork as a Supreme Court justice,
only to have the nomination fall apart in a contentious confirmation battle
after left-leaning groups opposed Bork's conservative judicial philosophies.

This fall, he was tapped to co-chair Republican presidential candidate Mitt

Washington .  President Obama nominated Sen. John Kerry to be the next
secretary of state Friday, calling him the "perfect choice" to replace Hillary
Clinton and lead America's foreign policy.

The president announced the decision in a brief press conference at the White
House as lawmakers were going home for the holidays. The nomination marks the
president's first move in replacing those members of his Cabinet who are not
sticking around for a second term.

Kerry was widely considered to be Obama.s top choice after U.N. Ambassador
Susan Rice removed herself from consideration last week.

Rice encountered a wall of Republican resistance over her comments in the
immediate aftermath of the Benghazi terror attack, in which she claimed the
attack was "spontaneous."

Kerry was the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, losing a close election
to incumbent George W. Bush. He's a decorated Vietnam veteran who was critical
of the war effort when he returned to the U.S., even testifying in front of the
Senate committee he eventually chaired.

Rice withdrew her name from consideration last week, making Kerry all but
certain to become the nominee. People familiar with the White House's
decision-making said support within the administration was moving toward Kerry
even before Rice pulled out.

The Cabinet nomination of Kerry, 69, is the first Obama has made since winning
a second term, and the first piece in an extensive shuffle of his national
security team. The president is also expected soon to nominate a new defense
secretary to take over for retiring Leon Panetta and a new director of the
Central Intelligence Agency to replace former spy chief David Petreaus, who
resigned last month after admitting to an affair with his biographer.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

2 firefighters die in ambush at blazing NY house

QPeCdYN1BJc53Ma4KqM/story.html

WEBSTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A gunman ambushed four volunteer firefighters responding
to an intense pre-dawn house fire Monday morning outside Rochester, N.Y.,
killing two before ending up dead himself, authorities said. Police used an
armored vehicle to evacuate more than 30 nearby residents.

The gunman fired at the firefighters when they arrived shortly after 5:30 a.m.
at the blaze near the Lake Ontario shore in Webster, town Police Chief Gerald
Pickering said. The first Webster police officer who arrived chased the suspect
and exchanged gunfire with him, authorities said.

''It does appear it was a trap'' for the first responders to the fire,
Pickering said at a news conference.

Authorities didn't say how the gunman died or whether anyone might have died in
the fire itself.

One of the dead firefighters was also a town police lieutenant; it wasn't clear
whether he returned fire. An off-duty police officer who was driving by was
injured by shrapnel, Pickering said.

Israel rejects NRA claims in aftermath of Newtown shootings

JERUSALEM -- Israel's policy on issuing guns is restrictive, and armed guards
at its schools are meant to stop terrorists, not crazed or disgruntled gunmen,
experts said Monday, rejecting claims by America's top gun lobby that Israel
serves as proof for its philosophy that the U.S. needs more weapons, not fewer.

Far from the image of a heavily armed population where ordinary people have
their own arsenals to repel attackers, Israel allows its people to acquire
firearms only if they can prove their professions or places of residence put
them in danger. The country relies on its security services, not armed
citizens, to prevent terror attacks.

The National Rifle Association responded to the Dec. 14 killing of 20
first-graders and six adults at a Connecticut elementary school by resisting
calls for tighter gun control and calling for armed guards and police at
schools. On Sunday, the lobby's chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, invoked his
perception of the Israeli school security system to back his proposal.

"Israel had a whole lot of school shootings until they did one thing: They
said, 'We're going to stop it,' and they put armed security in every school and
they have not had a problem since then," LaPierre said on the NBC News show
"Meet the Press."

Israel never had "a whole lot of school shootings." Authorities could only
recall two in the past four decades.

PARIS . Islamist militants seized a foreign-operated gas field in Algeria early
Wednesday and took 20 or more foreign hostages, including Americans, according
to an Algerian government official and the country.s state-run news agency, in
what appeared to be a retaliation for the French-led military intervention in
neighboring Mali.

 The Algerian agency said at least two people had been killed in the gas-field
seizure, including one British national, and that the hostages included
American, British, French, Norwegian and Japanese citizens.

Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters in Washington
that an unidentified number of American citizens were believed to be among the
hostages, and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, traveling in Italy, seemed to
raise the possibility that the United States might take military action in
response.

"By all indications this is a terrorist act," Mr. Panetta said. "It is a very
serious matter when Americans are taken hostage along with others." He also
said: "I want to assure the American people that the United States will take
all necessary and proper steps that are required to deal with this situation."

The exact number of people being held was still far from certain. A top
Algerian government official said 20 Islamist militants had attacked the gas
field and that security services had now "encircled the base" so that "no one
can leave." Concerning the number of hostages, he said that "the situation is
confused for the moment," and that there might be as many as 30. "We don.t have
precise figures for now."

As for the 20 attackers, he said, they came heavily armed, in three unmarked
vehicles. "That.s how they slipped through," he said.

All told, up to 40 workers could be held hostage, according to oil company
officials with interest in the field. A Japanese official confirmed that
Japanese nationals were involved, and the Irish Foreign Ministry said one Irish
citizen had been kidnapped. Some news agencies said as many as 41 hostages were
seized.

The attack on the gas field appeared to be the first retribution by the
Islamists for the French armed intervention in Mali last week, potentially
broadening the conflict beyond Mali.s borders and raising the possibility of
drawing an increasing number of foreign countries directly into the conflict.
Western officials had long warned that a Mali intervention, designed to halt an
Islamist militant advance in that country, could incite a backlash far beyond
Mali.s borders.

Algeria, which has its own long history of fighting Islamic militancy,
suggested it would show no tolerance for the gas-field attackers.

"The Algerian authorities will not respond to the demands of the terrorists and
will not negotiate," Algeria.s interior minister, Daho Ould Kablia, was quoted
as saying by the official news agency.

The attack occurred at the fourth largest gas development in Algeria, In
Amenas, and at its gas compression plant, which is operated by BP, the
Norwegian company Statoil and the Algerian national oil company Sonatrach.

Bard Glad Pedersen, a Statoil spokesman, said that of 17 Statoil employees
working in the field, only four were able to safely escape to a nearby Algerian
military camp. "There is a hostage situation," he said. "We do not provide
further information how we are dealing with the situation. Our main priority is
the safety of our colleagues."

The Sahara Media Agency of Mauritania, quoting what it described as a spokesman
for the militants, said they were holding five hostages in a production
facility on the site and 36 others in a housing area, and that there were as
many as 400 Algerian soldiers surrounding the operation. But that information
could not be confirmed, and the agency.s report on the specifics of where the
hostages were held raised questions about its credibility.

Fighters with links to Al Qaeda.s African affiliate, Al Qaeda in the Islamic
Maghreb, claimed responsibility for the attack, according to both Mauritanian
and Algerian news agencies. They quoted militants claiming that the kidnappings
were a response to the Algerian government.s decision to allow France to use
its airspace to conduct strikes against Islamists in Mali.

Islamist groups and bandits have long operated in the deserts of western
Africa, and a collection of Islamists have occupied the vast expanse of
northern Mali since last year. In retaliation for the French-led effort to
drive them out, those groups, including Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, have
pledged to strike against France.s interests on the continent and abroad, as
well as those of nations backing the French operations. In France, security has
been reinforced at airports, train stations and other public spaces.

 The militant groups are financed in large part through ransoms paid for the
freeing of Western hostages, and regular kidnappings have occurred in the West
African desert in recent years. Seven French nationals are presently being held
there.

The attack on Wednesday was carried out by a "heavily armed" group of
"terrorists" traveling aboard three vehicles, the Algeria Interior Ministry
statement said, and targeted a bus transporting foreign workers to a nearby
airport at 5 a.m.

Algeria, which shares a desert border of several hundred miles with Mali, has
resisted the possibility of organizing an armed intervention into the Malian
north, fearing that fighting could spill into Algeria or drive militants into
the country. Indeed, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, one of the militant
groups now holding northern Mali, began as an insurgent group fighting the
Algerian government in the 1990s. But Algeria has authorized French jets flying
missions in Mali to cross Algerian airspace.

Oil and gas are central to the Algerian economy, accounting for more than a
third of the country.s gross domestic product, over 95 percent of its export
earnings and 60 percent of government financial receipts. Large pipelines
connect the In Amenas fields with the Skikda liquefied natural gas export
terminal, one of two export port facilities that supply gas to France, Spain,
Turkey, Italy and Britain. Pipelines from the field also connect with Italy and
Spain. In recent years, Algeria was the third largest natural gas supplier to
Europe after Russia and Norway, according to the United States Energy
Department.

Algeria is also a major oil exporter to Europe and Asia, where its high quality
light sweet crude fits perfectly with local refineries. The United States is
traditionally a major importer of Algerian crude, although over the last few
years much of those imports have been replaced by new oil production in
American shale oil fields in North Dakota and Texas.

Algeria has traditionally been known as a secure place for foreign companies to
work and invest. Sonatrach and the security forces put tight security around
oil and gas facilities during the struggle with Islamic militants in the 1990s,
a period when energy infrastructure was never a major insurgent target.

Prime Minister David Cameron said tonight the country should be 'prepared for
the possibility of further bad news' in the hostage crisis in Algeria.

As many as 35 oil workers from Britain, America, Norway and Japan are feared
dead after Algerian forces launched a helicopter strike on a BP gas plant where
terrorists had taken the men hostage.

Mr Cameron cancelled his landmark speech on Britain's role in Europe tomorrow
to focus on the 'difficult and dangerous' situation.

Revealing that at least on Briton has been confirmed dead, he said: 'We should
be prepared for the possibility of further bad news, very difficult news, in
this extremely difficult situation.'

A backlash among Western governments was growing against Algeria after it took
the extraordinary decision to act alone - and kept Britain in the dark about
the dangerous rescue mission it was attempting.

The botched rescue took place as an unarmed American surveillance drone soared
overhead - yet the Algerian government had refused offers of help from America
and Britain as they tried to overcome one of the biggest kidnappings ever seen
in Africa.

Algerian forces strafed the Saharan gas plant with helicopter fire today hours
after rebels threatened to detonate explosives attached to the hostages if they
were attacked. The Algerian government says the army was forced to intervene.

Teen gunman kills 5 in New Mexico

http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/20/new-mexico-shooting/184938
3/

ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (AP) -- A teenage boy fatally shot two adults and three
children inside a New Mexico home, authorities said Sunday.

The teen was arrested and faces murder and other charges in connection with the
shootings Saturday night, Bernalillo County sheriff's spokesman Aaron
Williamson said.

The victims' identities haven't been released, and the boy's motive and
connection to the five victims weren't immediately known. Williamson said
investigators were trying to determine if the victims were related.

Investigators were trying to determine who owned several guns that were found
at the home. One was a semi-automatic military-style rifle.

Authorities weren't releasing the teen's name or age. He was booked on two
counts of murder and three counts of child abuse resulting in death.

The reason for it is becuase the FHA is a secured loan type and the only way
the gov't will secure is if it has completed certain requirements.

That sounds just like a condo association agreement. In that scenario,
the condio association owns the building, and the condo-owners have
partial ownership of the whole, as well as their own contents.

It doesn't matter who built the condo.  There is a "holding company"
and the owners of the units own that company.

  Did you and the neighbor both buy your halves from the construction
  company?  If so, my gut instinct is that the covenant runs with the
  land and is enforceable, you both have privity with the builder.

"aren't the covenants recorded at the county clerk's office?"

  County Recorder's office, and yes, they should be recorded somewhere.
  Recordation gives constructive notice, which is an element necessary

It means it's enforceable against later buyers who didn't necessarily agree to

The covenant burdens both estates, it can be enforced by whomever is the

SO we're watching Real Estate Intervention on Hulu, by the way, great show.
ANyways, there's a couple in one episode that are keeping the house and are
going to rent out "to a Section 8 renter." Mr Kyoti thought that the housing
unit itself had to be an approved Section 8 property, and based this on the
fact that you can look at areas and see the Section 8 properties as a
percentage of the housing. I thought that there were Section 8 "groups" of
housing, like an apartment community, but that the Section 8 applied to the
renter was portable and they could take it to any property and apply it there.
Anyone know how that works? Just curious based on this show...

I think both are correct, in a way.  A renter may have applied for the Section
8 voucher, but the govt. will not let them use it to rent just any property. 
It has to meet certain standards, and I think there's a separate section 8
inspection/paperwork/approval (other than normal rental permit).  Also, I think
in some cities you see groups of section 8 housing because the city decided to
purchase the properties and use them for low income housing.  In that regard,
they're not really different from any other owner who chooses to take section 8
vouchers/credits/whatever.

Kyoti> I have several clients that accept Sec8 funds for rent, all of them are
for 3-family dwellings or smaller. Some of the housing units are owner-occupied
multi=familys, too.

I'm in CT... The Sec8 does run a bit different here. Often after the Sec8
funding, the tenants still have to pay another couple hundred bucks out of
their pocket for rent. But at least the Sec8 secures the larger portion of the
rent for the landlord.

The high-rise and clustered housing units that take Sec8 in my area aren't
gov't owned. There might be some exceptions, but for the most part, they're
owned by REITs or even yet- some are still individually owned (looking at one
across the street from my office right now, Psycho Sy owns that building,
there's probably 20 units in the building, and I know its a Sec8 property from
some of my customers).

The way it works for a landlord... They apply to the Sec8 program, get
inspected and ordered to make certain improvements, etc. If they successfully
complete, they can then advertise they're accepting Sec8 tenants.

I think the Sec8's end up being clustered because low income folks are going to
live near public transit... So for CT, that means in the cities. If you own a
high-rise in a city and you want to guarantee receiving a portion of your
rental income, it'd behoove you to secure Sec8 approval for your building. Low
income folks can get away with skunking you on the rent, just so long as the
Sec8 income is enough to keep the building from failing inspection.

I had a similar escrow issue. My lender ultimately fixed it, paid late fees for
the past-due taxes, and I spent about an hour on the problem.

I do my due diligence, and I give my lender 2 phonecalls to fix the problem.
Generally, companies can't fix problems on the phone. If its not fixed by the
second call, chances are it won't be fixed by the 20th call. So I like sending
certified letters and opening formal complaints. I usually do this within 30
days of discovering a problem.

I deleted my personal stuff, but this is the last letter I used :



This is a "qualified written request" under Section 6 of the Real Estate
Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA).

(LENDER) informed us that we're $x past due for escrow balance. I was told
(LENDER) misapplied my monthly payments. Please review enclosed documentation
that states my $(monthly payment) is to be allocated as follows :
$a for pricipal
$b for interest
$c for taxes


I've requested a written explanation of the escrow balance shortfall. My lender
has refused to provide any explanation, nor have they fixed the problem of
misapplied payments.

I understand that under Section 6 of RESPA you are required to acknowledge my
request within 20 business days and must try to resolve the issue within 60
business days. I'd like to resolve this sooner as I believe this will benefit
all involved.


Respectfully Submitted,

It'd be nice if all lenders permitted that. Its my preference, but my lender
doesn't allow it, I suspect many lenders don't allow the direct-pays.

If the lender isn't paying the bill, they earn the hassle of auditing every
mortgage every year to see the insurance and tax is paid... Or the lender risks
losing their house to a casualty loss or losing thousands to the taxman. Right,
wrong, or indifferent, the lender can't afford those losses if they're only
getting a couple points of interest. If I didn't pay my tax for a year, that
would eat up more than half of the mortgage interest I paid in that year.
That's a lot of profit for a lender to lose (and granted, it is their risk to
take). I just wouldn't want to be in the position of the lender, and if I could
prevent that- or nip it in the bud, by forcing escrow, I would do it too.

Don't know about craigslist.  RTO options can be legit, but I'd think you'd
want the contract to very clearly specify who is responsible for what
maintenance and to spell out, in detail, how payments are to be applied as
"ownership credits" towards your eventual ownership, allocation towards real
estate taxes / levies, "interest"(?), etc etc etc.

RTO isn't a scam in general, but those listings you find on craiglists
probably fall somewhere between outright scams to awful deals.  RTO should not
be viewed as a mere convenience; the renter pays dearly for it. It's an
option, really. The renter buys the option with an up-front fee and by paying
premiums in addition to rent. The benefit of an RTO for you, the renter, is
that *if* you decide to buy, the premiums you'd been paying during the option
period are credited to the sale price of the house.  It's as if you had been
making payments against the principle all along. The drawbacks are that the
purchase price will be higher than current prices, and if you do *not*
exercise the option, then you lose the fees and premiums.  The terms are all
negotiable, of course.

RTOs have a purpose: Renters who can *almost*, but not quite, afford to buy
now, who are good at saving, and who have their hearts set on a specific
property, can buy the RTO option as a bet on their own success in saving
enough to qualify for the purchase during the option period.

IMHO, I don't see RTOs as being very useful. They kind of person they work for
doesn't exist: a very responsible, very lucky person, who will experience no
financial crisis or change of heart during the option period, who wishes to
buy today, and yet cannot afford to.

The only other kind of buyer I can think of is deployed in the armed forces or
professional/graduate school. They know exactly when and where they wish to
buy, (when their tour is over or they graduate). They wish to pay rent along
with their spouse... but want to keep cash on hand during the option period,
"just in case." Still, why not just rent...

Don't know about Craigslist, but read a report on RTO options recently. WHile
very few of the RTO renters end up purchasing, a lot of landlords really like
the option because they tend to get a better type of renter and the renters
tend to take better care of the property as they have that option of owning in
their minds. There was a great profile piece on a RTO renter and the landlord
that was renting to them a few months ago. The landlord was a small company who
specialized in RTO setups. They bought distressed and foreclosed properties,
put a bit into fixing them up and then found a good renter. The renter that was
profiled was a family who had hit hard times, had job losses, lost their house,
etc and ended up in this RTO situation. The house looked quite nice and the
family was obviously doing right by the landlord and their own interests.
But yes, the RTO of renters actually turning into owners of that property is
very low.

There has also been a problem of RTO renters losing all of their credits if the
property goes into default. Since the renters lein in the form of the credits
is inferior to the bank's lein in the form of the mortgage on the property, the
renter loses everything.

I know there isn't one right answer to this question. I'm just trying to get
some feedback.

We bought a house seven years ago for $280,000. The house would probably sell
now for between $250-275,000.

Good news is, we've been good about paying our mortgage and even throwing some
extra at the principle and refinancing twice, getting our original 6.75% note
down to 4.5%.

So we owe about $225,000 in it. IN GENERAL, if we are interested and can farily
comfortably afford getting a larger house in the $350,000 range right now, is
it "a good idea" to sell now for less than we paid for it? Or should we wait
til the market goes back up? Yes, I know we'd be able to afford less house if
the market goes back up but is the increase in equity going to make up for
that? Or will it to a certain point?

Assume we'd be able to put 20% down on a 30 year loan if we bought a new place.

You've got to think, the market is still down, especially for higher value
properties. If you can afford to "cut your losses" ie, sell for less than you
paid, you'll be able get some of that back by also buying more house than you
could have gotten at 7-years-ago values.

The real question then, if you can afford to take a loss on your current house
is are you "OK" with taking a loss on the old house. The crux is that if you
wait for the market to come back up on your house, it'll also come back up on
the house you end up buying.

RJ,



You could do a very complex analysis where you looked at values in your area
for houses similar to yours over the last 5-10 years (and tried to project that
forward) and did a similiar analysis for houses in the target area/size/type
you want to buy, and make a complex comparison that way.

It'd be a lot of work and include some guessing.

Or, you can consider that generally more expensive housing has generally
dropped a larger % in value, and that mortgage rates are MASSIVELY,
historically, low right now, and just go ahead and make the move... which
would be my suggestion, assuming you genuinely need/want/can afford the larger
more expensive home.


The other thing you might consider if you have some extra $, and don't really
_need_ a bigger place, would be to re-fi your current 4.5% note into a 15 year
mortgage, which would likely knock at least 1% off your rate, plus get it paid
off a good bit quicker of course.

RJ,  I think this is going to depend on what 250,000 is buying you in your
market.  If 250-300k is the going price for an average starter or second home
in your market it's going to be a big difference than if that's more like a
3000-4000 SF nicer house.  Quite honestly, I have a hard time imagining your
value decrease is that low unless you've made some improvements to your house
or put on an addition.

That said, I'd suggest you might want to take the time to find something
dramaticaly better, not just a standard upgrade.  I've found a number of people
in my area taking a loss on thier house because they found a bank owned
property that was listed at 50% of market value.

Two questions:

Background: We're looking at buying a moderately expensive piece of lakeshore
land, sitting on it for a while, and then building a house.

1) How exactly does a construction loan work? Do you make a down payment and
then get a line of credit equal to some preset amount of just what the bank
thinks you can afford? Do you have to know in advance how much you want to
borrow? And are interest rates on those comparable to a new mortgage?

2) This land already has on it a farmhouse and a barn. Neither are located
close to where we would build our house. The farmhouse is 2 stories, 1200 sq
ft., and charitably described as "salvageable," though there are no warranties
of habitability for the thing. We have no compunction about bulldozing the
thing, but I thought I'd ask you guys for any other long-term possibilities for
someplace like that once we had the money. Note: the farmhouse does NOT have
any kind of lake view or the like, at least not unless we took down half a
forest (it's a VERY wooded lot).

The barn, I imagine, we'd turn into a storage shed and shop, if we ever needed
a shop.

Anyone here familiar with termite damage?

I'm looking to buy a home and we found, in order:

1) That the place had been treated for termites previously. The broker said
"Oh, a friend of the family did that as a preventative measure."
2) 5 inches of termite damage, and there was evidence it'd been found before.
Hmmm. Couldn't see more because a bunch of storage stuff had to be cleared
away.
3) The seller's folks came in, cleaned out the storage area, found three feet
of termite damage, and fixed/treated it.

NOW, the problem I have is that this was all in a furnished 1st floor
(pseudo-basement) of a split-level, and the exterminator who did the inspection
said it was impossible to check the walls/ceiling for damage.

I hate bugs, AND I hate the idea of throwing my life savings into a house that
will be worthless in 20 years.

My questions:

1) Am I being unreasonable in asking the seller to give me permission to poke
some holes in the dry-wall, to look for further damage?
2) What are the changes that the home has severe (but secret) structural
damage?
3) Will I be okay if, regardless of what's behind the walls, I just get regular
termite treatments every year? The rest of the house seems for the most part to
be pretty well kept up. Also it's not an old house (built 1974, which is pretty
good for the Boston area).

Thanks much for any advice you can give me ...

I'm not much help with how to look for termite damage, but could you hire a
home inspector to look for damage and produce an objective report?

In some states a sale of a house can be contingent on what the home inspector
finds, meaning the buyer can back out without penalty if the inspector finds
something that had been undisclosed before the offer was submitted.

It's entirely possible that the house is ALREADY worthless based on your

Our house had terminate damage and ongoing treatment. The seller paid for an

up the down payment, then got locked into a year-long bureaucracy that the
brokers and banks didn't themselves understand. They didn't get the house, and

I don't think the lesson is AVOID short sales altogether. The lesson is don't

I dunno what happpened to the NPR story, but I've actually purchased a short
sale and it was fantastic... got an instant +$30,000 equity compared to buying
at market price.

Whole thing was about 3 months from offer to close.... and at no point was any
cash of mine "at risk" because in the contract you specify when the closing has
to happen or you get the earnest money (which is held in escrow) back.

I can't imagine a case where you'd ever have to give the -down payment-
upfront... most I've ever had to give up front is like 1-2 grand as earnest $,
and again that's in escrow and with specific terms about how/when you get it
back if you don't close through no fault of your own.

(basically it's only there so you lose something if YOU walk without cause in
the specified time period)

Apparently some states start with $1k and then require the entire down payment
be put up after 2 weeks without closing.
In Missouri, if the deal does not close within 365 days, the state gets the
earnest money.
Is the foreclosure market extremely satured in North Carolina? There is no way
a bank lets you close with extra equity on a short sell here., but the market
is not as saturated so they have a decent chance of eventually selling for the
full equity of the house. (Assuming the original owners walked with the house
upside down.)

Forclosures are actually pretty low here- the market never bubbled anywhere

It was more a question of the credit market had tightened up so badly, and the
house had been on the market for a while, that the bank was happy to take our
offer even if it was 20-30k below the appraised value (and 50 under wha they
originally listed the place for)

We got the place for $24,500 under what it originally sold for in 2006 brand
new (and the at-time-of-sale apprasal was pretty close to that original sale
price)

It's very uncommon that a rennovation odds more value to the home than the

... anyone here?

I'm putting an offer in on a house tonight. This would be my 3rd house purchase
in 15 years, so I've done it a couple times but I'm no expert.
Seeking any random thoughts.

 - List price=$258k. There is a full-price offer already on the table,
   contingent on the buyer's house sale. Not accepted. My offer has to be very
   aggressive, so we are thinking of doing full price, no continegencies on
   sale of our house. We can ride out two mortgage payments for a while if
   necessary. We did it last time.

   I want to offer a little less, like $252. My wife says no way, we can't let
   this one slip away for a few thousand. Oy. Women.

 - At this price, my buying realtor (friend of my parents) will take home
   > $7,000 for a couple weeks of work. Not bad for him. Which brings me to...

 - We need to sell our house ASAP, in a bad market. It's a 3BR/1Bath split
   foyer with an in-ground pool, to go on the market in October. Fuck me. This
   is not an in-demand house. I'm going to list it at the price we paid 9 years
   ago and hope for the best.

   BUT... our buying realtor is not really experienced. I don't know if he can
   move this house quickly. I'm considering saying sorry, but I need to find
   someone who knows all the tricks. Is that rude? He's already cashed in from
   our quick buy. How could he complain?

 - So, realtor fees suck. Has anyone ever heard of people selling it on their
   own, but agreeing to pay a buying realtor fee? What if it's like 4%? That
   would be some sweet, easy cash for a buying realtor, and be cheaper than
   a 6% fee I might normally pay.

 - Seems to me like there needs to be big incentive to realtors to show and
   pump up my property to buyers who might have lots of options. What else can
   I do to interest realtors in showing the house? It will be empty, so easily
   accessible with no notice. We'll stage it nice, etc.

 - On that note, is it rude to ask a realtor to lower his selling fees, and
   then offer the normal fee if there is an accepted offer in the first
   month? Sell it in 30 days and you get 3%. Longer than that and you get 1.5%.

I know everyone hates the house-selling process, and right now it really sucks.
We're taking on considerable financial risk, but we'll be fine. I just want to
maximize the equity I squeeze out of my house while moving it as fast as we
can.

In summary, I have the exact same plain vanilla concerns and questions as every
house buyer/seller out there today.

Blah. :)

I did the "sell on my own" thing once.  It was a lot of work but I did it
because I hate the realtor cartel and got some utility out of helping to
snap that.

I paid a nominal fee to a company to get on the MLS listings.  Then I
agreed to pay (I think) 3% to a buyer's agent who comes up.  If someone
had shown up without an agent I would have given half-to-most of that
fee to the buyer as a credit (something like several thousand).

I had trouble selling, partially because of what I was selling (I did not
do the whole granite-countertop hardwood-floor shiznit that was so popular
in the Boston area at the time), and I suspect partially because I didn't
have a seller's agent pushing my place.  But I'm skeptical of the seller's
agents incentives anyway; if they sell the place quick they make quick money,
if they sell the place slowly they make slow money, so if a place doesn't
sell quickly I suspect it moves to the bottom of their list.

My experience was that no agent would bother negotiating fees.  It's like
an old-time guild and any movement on prices is seen as very dangerous to
the members.  With things being rough for real estate agents they may be
more willing to negotiate on terms these days.  It may also be that anyone
willing to negotiate on terms isn't the "best of the best" like you are
hoping to find to sell the house quickly.

  Not sure it helps, but I see flyers here that say they will sell your
  house for 1%

  Yes, find a selling realtor, don't use your buying one. Ours worked ok,
  but I think we coudl have done better with a dedicated selling realtor.
  Our buywer REALLY helped us find the house we wanetd.

  To me, it seems like realtors have gone from demanding 6% to being
  able to negociate, so I'd say it can't hurt to ask.

  If you want the house, offer the full price. What's 6k? Worth a mad wife
  for the rest of your life? no!

  Price for your house, I don't know listing the price from 9 years ago

As for the place you're buying, it depends on how bad you/your wife really want

  You don't get an answer, you call their manager.

  You can see if they will eat a point and get you half way between 3.5 and
  3.75. Or ask them if they eat some closing costs.

Closed thursday, moved yesterday! Now we just need to sell our old house...

Trying to come up with a good, aggressive, sell-fast price. One realtor
suggested we listed it $2k less than we paid.

She said we bought at the height of the market (2003) and we're selling at the
bottom.

I'm curious... can I find stats specifically about houses that were sold in
2003, and again recently? I'd like to compare the relative sales prices, just
to see if it's generally true that prices have stayed stable or gone down? Or
is this just the realtor trying to get a quick sale? :)

How much did you put into it after you moved in? I paid $45,000 in 1986 for our
house then added $25,000 in improvements over the years. It's valued for tax
purposes at $110,000 for tax-year 2012. If you're eager to get out of the old
property it doesn't matter what you sell it for; but if you are trying to
recoup at least your original cost you should think a little more now that
housing markets are generally rebounding.

Finally have my house ready to sell. I've met with 3 realtors, gotten some
opinions, suggested listing range is $154,900-$174,900. Kind of big range :)

Now I'm really considering doing FSBO. I can price it a lot more aggressively
($10k below appraisal) and still come out way ahead. Total cost to me is about
$300, and if it doesn't work in 3 weeks, I can switch to a realtor.

I just can't stand the thought of paying $11,000 if the house is going to sell
itself. I don't see any 'magic' that any of the realtors is going to add, other
than an MLS listing and maybe some word-of-mouth to other agents.

Lots of friends I talked to have had success with FSBO. With it getting close
to the holiday season, it's a bit risky. It might sit if it doesn't sell soon.
But I think I'm willing to try it.

Q> I paid $164,900, 9 years ago. We've put about $30k into it - new septic,
furnace, air, wood fence, deck, paint, carpet, pool liner, and a couple other
things. Nothing that really increases the value much, but all of it together
make it a much nicer, less-maintenance home. I hope.

I'm thinking of listing FSBO at $159,900. I think it will move. I think.

  Stop and think how you went about buying your new home.
  Without MLS, I think your house won't see the light of day: i.e. buyers.

  You CAN still get MLS, without a relator. I don't remember how, but it is
  fairly common these days. I think you should do that, might add another
  $100 or so to your $300 FSBO estimate, but WELL worth it.

  After paying 2 mortgages for 9 months...and in this economy (we sold our
  house _RIGHT_ before the crash, i still remember our relator telling the
  buyers: "the price is great, not like it will loose value". I sure hope
  they aren't on the street).

JP> At $159,000, that's about $140/sq ft. But that's just for the main level of
a split foyer (1140 sq ft). If you count the finished basement and the
unattached finished pool house, it's $69/sq ft of finished space.

The house we just bought was about $110/sq ft, I believe.


That being said, I hate $/sq ft measures. It seems somewhat worthless.

Square footage itself is deceiving. Not counting finished basements, for
example, seems stupid. It should be total finished sq ft, not just the main
floor.

Real estate agents get paid the same whether your house sells easy in a few

Indeed, Egregious. I see a realtor's real value as being able to bring in a
flood of new potential buyers in the first few weeks, thereby increasing the
odds of finding one that wants the house.

I see the advantage of FSBO as weeding out the people who would have found it
anyway, either by seeing the sign in the yard or finding it themselves online.

I don't want to pay $10k to a realtor to find people that would have found me
anyway. So I'm leaning towards a 3-step sales process:

1. FSBO for 2-3 weeks. Find the "easy sells" if they exist, and avoid the
   realtor commission if a buyer is found. I am fairly connected. I can get the
   word out pretty well. I'm also a decently smart guy. I'm not all that
   impressed by the intelligence of realtors I've talked to.

2. If it doesn't sell, list with a realtor at the same price as FSBO, and just
   accept the financial hit if it sells.

3. If it still doesn't sell in a month or two, stand on street corner and beg,
   to be able to pay two mortgages thru the winter.

Ha. Actually, I can stay afloat paying both mortgages indefinitely. But that
SUCKS.

What concerns me most is going into the winter, having to pay gas/elec on both
houses, having to shovel snow, having the pool be closed and the nice yard not
be a huge selling point like it is now.

In short, I have to hurry my ass up if I want this to sell before December.

I fucking hate houses.

Well, I've now talked to 5 different realtors. They're all so different. It's
really hard to pick the 'right' one, though I'm not sure how much impact the
selling realtor really has anyway.

We decided not to go FSBO just because I don't think I have time to deal with
it. Showings, open houses, etc. I realize I'll be losing thousands of dollars,
but I just need to get this house sold.

What I find almost amusing is the variation in prices that they would list at:

(A) Mel Foster (7%) : 175,000-185,000

(B) Remax (6%) : 164,900

(C) Remax (7%) : 169,900 (or 164,900 to sell faster)

(D) Mel Foster (7%) : 159,900-164,900

(E) Mel Foster (7%) : 154,900

I'm not sure that any of them "clicked" with me, but perhaps I'm expecting a
little more intelligence and savviness than can be expected in this
profession. Not sure.

I have another guy coming tomorrow morning, which I might cancel. I should just
pick one and get started.

But I'm happy that 5 realtors already have exposure to the house and may
already be looking for buyers :)

From what I've read, good agents don't negotiate commission, because they don't
have to.

A 1% difference for me would be about $1,600, which would be great. That's the
new dining room table we want. But if I talked an agent down 1%, would they
hold a grudge and market it less?

In the case of Remax, they get 100% of the commission, rather than splitting it
with their company. (though they of course split with buyer's agent). But they
have to do all their own advertising, so they are investing their own money
which they are out if they don't sell it. I kind of like that. There's
incentive there.

Here's the fun variety of realtors I've talked to already:

(A) Our buying realtor on our new house. New, part-time, and naive. He priced
way too high. No way we're using him. I don't think he could sell much of
anything.

(B) A nice lady recommended by our neighbor. She's at 6%, lives just down the
road, and knows the area very well. But she doesn't seem aggressive and her
printouts about herself had grammatical errors. She might be a good person to
bring me a buyer, though.

(C) An older single lady, with "CLOZER 1" on her license plate. 32 years
experience, but she seemed a bit insane. She wanted to price at 154k, well
below everyone else. I think she's looking for an easy, quick sale. She kind of
annoys me.

(D) An indian woman used by many co-workers. Very nice, came with an assistant
who was smart. Seemed very reasonable, very intelligent, but not sure how
aggressive she is. I kind of liked her assistant more than her.

(E) A very talkative lady who wore too much perfume, but was very nice. Very
religious, talked a lot about being Christian. Seemed very into her clients
personally, likes to market a lot, seemed to be in sync with me about what the
selling points are and how to market the house. Seemed to get my sense of
urgency and overall loved the house.

I'm actually leaning towards (E) because she seemed like a nice, hard-working,
motivated person. She sells $5-$6 million a year, which is great, but she says
she stops herself from being a "Top Producer" because she can't provide the
right service if she has too many listings.

Though I don't like her religious slant, I'm leaning to her.

One more realtor tomorrow. Maybe he's the one.

3 realtors have said that to me. The one today even took a picture of the pool

house with a pool. I could hear him getting texts.

I don't know. I almost asked to see his texts. I kind of suspect that it's a

buyer.

Realtors usually won't show a buyer to a FSBO property, because they're not

Well, I had the best of luck. Accepted an offer tonight. Here's the executive
summary, in the unlikely event that anyone cares:

- One of the first realtors I saw claimed to have an interested buyer. This
  was two weeks ago.

- Two days ago, she emailed and asked if I would do a one-time showing for a
  3% commission. I said yes, if it's ASAP.

- I told her I was listing very soon, with another agent. Sorry about that.

- I called the other agent, and told her LET'S GO! She was actually a friend of
  the other one, from the same office. Oops.

- I told my selling agent of the other person, and that I would like an
  exception for that person only. She reluctantly said yes.

- I told her I would give her a 1% commission, just because I am a nice guy,
  and because I still wanted her to go forward with her listing work in case
  this other person didn't come through, which I assumed would be true.

- The buyer went through last night, loved it, went through again tonight,
  loved it, wrote an offer.

Asking Price: $164,900

Offer: $162,500
No contingencies, pre-approved, 20% down.
- I pay to close pool and have it inspected
- I pay for septic inspection
- I buy a home warranty
- I pay up to $600 for radon remediation, if necessary
- I pay 3% commission to their realtor, 1% to mine to be nice
- She keeps all the appliances and furniture that we didn't want anyway
- I come back in the spring and show her how to operate the pool

Not a bad deal at all. Similar to what a FSBO would have been, actually.

The only part that I don't really like is the "me coming back" part, but I
didn't want to cross out anything that would give her time to reconsider
anything. So I'll come back. Oh well.

So, the house is still listed, but will go "pending" soon.
( http://www.melfosterco.com/listing-detail.html?mls_number=4138600 )

My realtor is going to get a $1,600 paycheck for doing almost nothing, assuming
it goes through. But oh well. I believe in not ripping people off, and she
deserves to be paid for her time and effort. She's okay with it, even though I
think she resents the other realtor a little. They can work it out. I wouldn't
be surprised if they each just take 2%.

So anyway, it all worked out. Now I just hope nothing falls through. I hope...

  Whoa, 2.5% on a 15 yr fixed?
  3.0 on a 20 year fixed? (Didn't know that was an option)
  3.5 on a 30 year fixed.

  Our current rate is 4.75.
  Dropping more than a point seems worth it, just hate closing costs.

  I was looking at our "zillow cost" to see what our house might be worth..
  and that led me to some quotes, the 20 yr fixed i mentioned above for 3.00.
  $150 Loan origination, $390 appraisal, $595 Underwriting, $595 rebate so
  total would be $540..out of pocket? Some reason I remember it being 2-3k...

  The calculator put the 2.5% at 2k/month, which is a $300 bump above our
  current payment of $1677 (though we are "happily" paying $1800 to get our
  principal down faster). Clearly in the long run, 15 vs 30 is a no brainer,
  the question is, can we affording 323 extra per month? probably. (easily
  if my wife got a job that paid her instead of us spending money on a
  business that feels like its going no where).

  Wellsfargo (where I have my current loan) sais they require 1% origination
  fee. crap? feels like it.

We needed a new garage so I refinanced back in August with aimloan.com.
we had a 30 year@4.75 and we refinanced down to a 30 year @3.625 and took
advantage of some extra cash with no points.  It was great.  We took out
enough to cover a huge chunk of the garage (we have an expensive garage
since it's half underground) and still ended up with a montly payment
less than our previous loan.  The best part is, if I pay the previous
mortgage, we'd also still pay the new loan off in less time than it would have
to pay off the remainder of the previous loan.

aimloan.com was neat.  They have a loan chart that showed what the rates were
(with and without points) and.  They're rates slide down on a scale the better
your LTV ratio.  For example what I originally wanted to pull out had us at a
77% LTV ratio and to get the rate we wanted they wanted us to buy a point.
Instead I just said screw it dropped a couple grand out of the cash-out and
got us to 74.9% and got us the rate without points.

It was nice to get all the options they gave us.  Back when we refi'ed the
average was around 3.875.

It was a nice process.  I also plugged the numbers in and found that if we
paid the same mortgage as a 15 year with the lower rate (can't remember what
the 15 year rate was through aimloan.com) it would take 17.5 years to pay off
the 30@3.625.  Once our kid is out of day care I intend to pay at the 15 year
rate, so it was really nice to have the flexibility and really the extra 2.5
years is a fine trade-off for that.

  Locked in a 3.375% (down from 4.75%). Still 30 yr fixed (oh well).
  Over $300 less per month!
  All pending the appriasal of the house of course.

  I was getting quotes from moneysafe.com (recommended by people in our HOA)
  but he had 3.625% and I asked him about it, he said "go with someone else"
  so I did (Round Point mortgage). Jerk.

  Irony, Round point might end up servicing the mortgage with whom we have
  our current loan with so I might end up paying the same person i do now.

  One weird thing: subordination fee. That real?

  Yep.

  Last time i refi-ed, in 2010, i did it with the same lender (WF) and there
  was $0 out of pocket (though I likely either got a slightly higher % than
  the best rate to make up for it or they rolled the closing costs into the
  loan, I don't remember).
  Anyways, there was likely no subordination fee because it was with WF.
  $200-250 isn't too bad if that's all it ends up being.

  Houses are going for $108/sqft so ours will hopefully appriase for

JL> In 5 years it'll convert to rate dictated entirely by a major 3rd party
index, such as LIBOR, plus a margin on top of that, and clamped to a cut-off

when it resets, there is a cut-off ceiling to prevent complete
unpredictability. The ONLY unknown in an ARM (compared to an FRM) is the index
rate. Everything else is spelled out.

Should you take the 2% deal? You'll be $25K richer in 5 years (not sure what
you mean by this -- is the payment identical?). In 6 years, you'll be paying a
higher rate (no doubt) on a possibly larger principle. The question is really
how fast does the ARM overtake FRM, i.e., can you do better with your personal
investments at the 5 year discount than the ARM will cost you after it resets.

Well, wouldn't you re-fi into another ARM after the initial 5 years ends?

The things you've said are all the reasons why I've stayed far away from ARM's.
But this guy owns 9 properties and does a lot of real estate investing, and he
says "Peoples' fear costs them a lot of money." He's done ARMs for years and
has never faced any big problems.

I'm also not sure what the terms are to get this rate. It might require 20%
down, which I don't have anyway.

My thinking was that I could save on monthly payments and use the savings to
pay down more off the principle, get rid of PMI faster, and come out ahead in 5
years.

We're thinking of moving again in 5-10 years, so that's another reason it seems
tempting.

You could, but your new refi rate will be based on the current index rate,
which is exactly what your current ARM reset would be based on. So the cost of
the refi might outweigh any marginal gains in the rate you'd get on the fixed
rate period of the refi.

> "Peoples' fear costs them a lot of money."

True, but that doesn't mean the fear is unfounded. Probably best to change the
word "fear" to "risk-aversion" to take the bravado out of that statement.

I'm not sure which is worse for housing costs.  They are both very ugly.
At least realtor fees seem to be finally facing some pricing pressure.
Money Magazine had an article about how one agent got blackballed for
daring to lower the fee from 6% to 5.5%; they published it about a decade
ago.  It was entirely out of her own pocket but no one wanted anyone to
compete on price.

One major reason I did a FSBO was to do my part to break that guild.

here, escrow is the account that pays your property tax and homeowners

In our case once the short sale was approved by the bank and the seller is when
you get the appraisal done for your lender and get the home inspection done for
your own safety... and hope they don't find anything major, because they're
probably not going to fix it.

In our case it was fine as the house was only a couple years old...then another
week or two for the lawyers/title folks to get everything lined up to close,
then show up at closing and sign documents for 22 hours.

Two signers and they know what they're doing, figure exactly an hour, add 15-30

One signer who doesn't know what they're doing or two where at least one

Been in my house for almost 11 years now.  It appreciated quickly after I got
it; I was working multiple part-time jobs so I refi'ed in '04 (30-year fixed,
around 5.75%) and tacked on a HELOC in... '06, maybe.  My ex (who's also on
the deed) moved halfway around the world around that time, and we agreed that
I would either a) pay her some amount (maybe $20-$25K) to buy out her interest
in the property or b) split any profit with her if I sold it.

Anyway, rates are now in the basement, but the economic crash a few years back
hit the reset button on prices where I live, and although the market is now
starting to recover, most of what's actually selling near me is foreclosure
inventory, which is keeping prices low.  My credit score has dropped to maybe
720-730, too, since although I pay on time, I ran up my cards a couple years
back and now have a wife and kid, so I've only recently (last few months)
been able to get a good enough handle on everything that I should be able to
start seriously paying them off this year.

It'd be great if the house magically appreciated overnight to a bit more than
the sum of the mortgage, the HELOC, the credit cards, and $20-25K for the ex.
(And that would only be, say, $165K.  We're not talking a McMansion, here.)
Since I don't see _that_ happening this year, I figure my best strategy is to
wait for it, and in the interim first pay off the low-limit, high-rate credit
card (Amex and Delta will be just fine without me), then the high-limit,
low-rate credit card (yes, amazingly, I have such a beast), then the HELOC,
then the mortgage, thus improving my credit rating (and thus my rates) for
whenever the market recovers enough to make a re-fi possible.

In the meantime, I've noticed one local bank advertising "bring in your HELOC
statement and we'll show you how much you can save," so I'm thinking of seeing
if they're willing to replace my existing HELOC with something lower-rate.

Any thoughts on any of this, or additional suggestions?

Ok, so we're in contract to buy a house.

The seller/their bank (short sale) are giving us a $12,000 credit towards
closing costs without us even having to ask.

Today, the home inspector did his thing, and found several problems -- kitchen
floors need to be replaced (water leak at some time), leak from a bathroom has
caused some dry wall to need replacement, termites in the chimney and decks
(not in the actual house, no need for tenting), several windows that let in
condensation, some minor roof repair. Overall, the inspector says the house is
in good shape but he estimates getting all the stuff fixed will run, well,
close to $12,000.

Is it in poor form to ask for a price reduction and/or an additional credit on
the closing statement for repairs, since it seems like the seller/agent knew
there was some maintenance to be done and thus basically decided to pay the
closing costs?  Or is it one of those things where we ask, they probably say
no, and we move on with the sale if we choose to continue?

Our realtor seems to think that we won't be able to get anything else out of

An acquaintance (the buyer in this story) told me this today: A buyer's final
inspection uncovered a wet interior wall "hidden" behind a large appliance
(washer, freezer, I don't recall) probably due to a leak or condensation.
Seller said they didn't know about it. Seller (via lawyers) placed $2,000 in
escrow to fix the wall before closing.  Buyer hired friend-of-friend's-nephew
to fix wall for $900.  Nephew fixed the wall then conspired with the buyer to
write a receipt for $1,300, defrauding the seller out of at least $400.
Seller freaked out at price and demanded an itemization of the $1,300.
Fix-it-nephew doctored up an itemization. Seller smelled a rat and demanded
further itemization. Buyer is now panicky because this is jeopardizing the
whole deal.

Ok, so far this is hardly an uncommon story. Unscrupulous people ripping each
other off at every opportunity? What else is new. It's the whole reason we
have regulated middle-men, such as brokers, agents, inspectors and lawyers.
The seller should have demanded several quotes, and the option to review them.

But here's the crazy part: the buyer feels *entirely* justified in charging
$1,300 for the $900 fix-it job because (a) the buyer feels she should be
compensated for the hassle of dealing with the fix, (b) the buyer thinks she
was savvy in finding a cheaper price through her nephew so deserves to reap
the "discount", and (c) the buyer suspects the seller knew about the leak in
the first place.

This is very much your-mileage-may-vary kind of thing, but it helped with some
slow network response issues I had with Win7 machines a while back.
  http://www.tek-tips.com/viewthread.cfm?qid=1650560

Basically, it's two commands (a link from the thread explains what they do).
  netsh int tcp set heuristics disabled
  netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled

They recommend a reboot after these two commands.
In my case, it was for Windows SBS 2003 but I'm not sure the server OS matters.

We constantly fight printer problems.  And I hate, hate, hate H A T E printers.
We've got something on the order of 8,000 of the blasted things.

We've been in a huge rush to upgrade all of our print servers to Windows 2008
R2, consolodate drivers to the point where we have about 3 of them (thank god
for the HP universal drivers), and limit the number of printers on a given
print server to 500.

Make sure the SNMP agent is unchecked in the server driver's printer config box
for a given printer.  That helps too.

Also, having the latest drivers is always a good idea.  And firmware on the
printers being up to date is important as well.

i mean, i have limited use for printers, but an hp with a jetdirect card is a
decent piece of equipment. they're cheap, have user serviceable parts, and last
(generally longer than you'd like). in order to get that out of a switch, you
spend $20k on a chassis, you don't get that with a monitor, same for security

At my last job we had Xerox come in and do a printer review.  We had tons of
managers who "needed" to have a printer in their office, so of course they all
had completely different ink jet printers of some sort.

Xerox did a printer count and made a nice graph which broke down the cost
of supplies (read: ink) for all of these one-off inkjet printers.  They
then compared the costs to having a few Xerox multi-purpose printers in
various locations throughout the building.  Not too long after that, the
inkjet printers disappeared.

IT was happy because they had far fewer printers to manage.  Most of the
users ended up being happy because the Xerox machines were actually
really cool.

Xerox also had some software which would force your print jobs to the
cheapest machine; that is, if you tried to print 1,000 copies to one
of the local printers, the software would re-route that job to the
print shop.

Going back aways. I have many machines installed in many different locations
(400+) and many of them rely on dial-up networking and an old fashioned modem
to communicate. I standardize the equipment as much as I can, and use standard
images. I have one site that is trying to dial out several times during the
day. Now, these machines do have a connection configured in windows, and our
software calls on that connection whenever it needs to communicate (alert, send
data etc) I see in the log where it connects to send data, and all is fine.
Later in the log, it is trying to dial. Some show it trying two digits, which
at these sites will give a reorder tone if the correct prefix is not used. Then
it tries #,## and fails again. At some point it is able to ring an extension in
the hotel.
This is happening nightly, and I cannot find what is causing it to happen. This
particular system has never been plugged into the network once the image was
installed. It does have MS Security essentials on the image, and it is finding
nothing. Again, no other machines using this image are having this problem.
Looking at the log files shows just the expected connections.
Any thoughts?
 I have removed all fax components as well.

Trying to work this out in my head, and it's twisting my brain. Could use some
help.

I wired cat5 to wall jacks in various rooms in my house, with the central patch
panel in the basement. I have redundant runs in each room. My cable modem and
m0n0wall router are in my upstairs office.

I'm not getting the bandwidth from my ISP that I should be, and I want to test
if it's a hardware bottleneck on my router. I'd like to test it by running m0n0
from a VM on my VMware box, located in the basement.

Can I simply plug the network cable from the cable modem into the spare jack in
the office, and patch that port directly (bypassing the core switch) into the
NIC I'm using for the WAN interface on the VMware box? If so, does that need to
be a crossover cable or a straight-through?

Why not take a laptop and connect straight from the cable modem to the laptop?
Then run a speed test from there. That will be about as clean a speed test as
you are going to get. If you get the expected rate, then look at the router.

So it looks like this?
ISP <-> cable modem <-> m0n0wall <-> switch <-> office PC
                                        ^-> vmware box
And you are suggesting this?
ISP <-> cable modem <-> office PC <-> vmware box

I think if you want to test m0n0 on the vmware box you want
ISP <-> cable modem <-> vmware box <-> office PC

Or have I misunderstood? I think you'd want crossover between vmware NIC and
the office PC NIC. Some cards will autosense it anyway, so may not matter.

Essentially, I want to test the hardware issue by moving my m0n0 installation

shouldn't present any sort of measurable bottleneck. The reason I'm trying this
is that, if it fixes the issue, I then have the permanent solution in place.

What I'm trying to do is go from this is adjust the layer 1 connection from
this:

Print times> It varies anywhere from 4 seconds to 1+ mins just doing test

I think I might have figured it out though.  I think it's a driver issue after
all.  Specifically the 64 bit drivers on a Windows 7 box.  So, looks like I
have to test this further and then deploy it.

Is there a way to easily push new drivers from the server on a Windows 7 box
over the domain?  Normally, just updating them on the server takes care of it.
However, on the new Windows 7 machines, I had to give Admin access to add
printers.  I ended up adding every printer we had the machine to load every
driver, prior to making the image that I then deploy.

Obviously, I don't want to retouch 50-70 deployed machines.  I have since
turned off the UAC as it caused issues with one specific program updating
automatically.  I don't know if this makes a difference or not.  Anyone have
any experiene with this?

Okay, so, my google-fu must be failing.  On a domain, using a 2008 DC, I am
trying to make it so any Authenticated User can connect to any printer on the
network.  Thus, if they connect to a new printer and the driver isn't
installed, that it just loads the driver and adds the printer without any
issues.  In researching, I found:

http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753269.aspx

Which told me to use GPO to change "Computer Configuration\Policies
\Administrative Templates\Printers" and change it to Disable.  Per the article:

  To disable driver installation warning messages and elevation prompts on
  computers that are running Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, in the Point
  and Print Restrictions dialog box, click Disabled, and then click OK. This
  setting disables the enhanced printer driver installation security of Windows
  7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.

But I still cannot log onto my Windows 7 machine as a generic user and install
the new printer without a prompt.  What am I missing here???  I need to deploy
new print drivers to all my Windows 7 machines, so I'm trying to test this on a
single machine first so I don't pooch all our printers.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

  The GPO setting you changed seems to be more related to UAC or the simple

We have a remote facility, call it Building A.  It has 2 Metro-E circuits (1GB
plus a 900MB) back to our primary datacenter.

When doing large backups, we are okay.  However, a restore failes with CRC
errors.

When doing large file transfers, over SMB, we get CRC errors.  Which is sort of
expected.  But with TFTP or FTP we get the same problem when copying a file
from building a to the primary DC.

We've ruled in, then out the servers.  1 server is able to backup and restore
without issue.  It has been compared, by Microsoft to its peer which cannot
backup/restore without errors.

We're out of ideas.  All the obvious stuff has been tried.  We've done tuning
on a couple servers and have gotten the bandwidth charts to go from a saw tooth
looking diagram into a nice linear then smooth sailing charge.  TCP Chimney
adjustments have been made along with other TCP settings.

Still, we get failures.

Our webserver has been hacked, and we cannot get connected to it over RDP. It
is enabled, and users have permissions, and telnetting to the server on port
3389 is connecting, but type the name into MSTSC, and it instantly fails. The
system is functioning otherwise normally. Websites are being served, FTP and
SFTP services are running.
I did find that tscc.msc had been deleted. I have restored it. I did notice
that the service for terminal services is set to manual, but you cannot stop,
or restart it. Disabling it, then setting it back to manual automatically
launches it again. I have never looked at this service before, or paid
attention to this, so not sure if this is normal.
So, what could the hacker had done to the service to not allow connections, but
otherwise have it appear that it is working?

well, I know it was a hacker because of the new user accounts created. Plus,
there is the mass email software I removed, as well os other programs like 4th

constantly finding the guest account part of the admin group.
So, I am guessing it was someone accessing the server who should not have been,
and adding all of this stuff.
I would love to do a rebuild, but there are so many things that our software
people have done, and not fucking documented, that rebuilding it would be a
serious time sink. P)lus, they created things that do not allow us to run
windows updates due to breaking websites.
As typical, I asked for development time to fix all of these vulnerabilities
before we were hacked, and it was not considered, just discarded.

Verizon 4G device.

I use m0n0wall at home and have the mobile vpn stuff setup.  On my W7 laptop, I
use VPN Access Manager to get back to the house.

Using my 3G Verizon datacard, it works like a champ.  I can VPN in and with the
exception of seeing networks that also VPN into my house (parent's & sister's)
it works great.

Switch on the hotspot on my 4G phone, setup WiFi on my laptop and the VPN
tunnel will get built.  But no traffic will go across it.

Any thoughts to as why?  I'm thinking something in the IPv4->v6->v4 thing is
breaking it.

  looks like the hotspot is NATing, though that shouldn't itself cause an
  issue. However, there might be a setting needed (that might or might not
  be available) to allow the VPN traffic to leave the "local" (laptop<->phone)
  network.

We got a report that one of our apps wasn't working in a branch office.  Traced
it down to specific UDP packets being dropped on the network.  Upon
investigating, things don't seem logical.  The server is in Main Office,
packets are dropped somewhere between the Main Office server and the clinet
machines in Branch Office A.  Clients in Branch Office B and C have no such
issues.  Network guys say everything is working fine, but obviously it isn't
(tcpdump on server shows packets leaving, tcpdump on client shows they never
arrive).  So here is what does not make sense to me...If I take a laptop that
connects over VPN to the server, it drops packets in Office A but not Office B.
 Over the VPN, there shouldn't be any differences.  The (Cisco) vpn traffic is
all encrypted TCP so it's not like there is a matching UDP packet on the
physical device to get dropped.  This happens over both wired (VPN and non-
VPN)and WiFi (VPN only) in the branc office.  A traceroute for a VPN connection
in the branch offices shows no differences between any of the routes the data
takes.  How could the packet be dropped over the VPN only when physically
located in that office?  The VPN device doesn't know where I'm at.  It's
obviously being blocked, but how can that be?  What am I missing here?

some branch sites could have network devices configured with legacy ACLs that
superseded newer ACLs (i.e. SNMP traffic).  Maybe there's also a firewall rule
that's blocking the traffic?

Except how would it block when on the VPN?  That's why it doesn't make sense.
Sure if it were blocking only when not on the VPN, but we see it block/drop the
UDP data on the VPN while in that office, but no where else.  I too doubt it
would be the VPN dropping packets and as far as the devices in the main office
are, it don't see how they would know if the machine on the VPN were in a
specific branch office or not.  It doesn't make sense, but we can se it
happening.  What'a also odd, if we send 255 2 byte udp packets only specific
ones are dropped so something isn't simply dropping UDP data.
Thought just occured to me, would virus protection possibly block data so it
wouldn't show up on a tcpdump (windows box).  I wouldn't expect it to bahave
differently in different offices, but they run Trend and it does some weird
things.  If that were the case it would have to be blocking both inbound and
outbound traffic, with the blocked inbound not showing up in tcpdump while the
blocked outbound does show up.  Doesn't seem likely.  Ideas?

waiting on hold, everything came back online. I was talking to the "tech" and
he said it showed I was only getting 60-70% of my speed. I told him of my
issues, and he wants me to move the modem to another phone jack. I tried to
explain that the jack it is plugged into is right where the phone line comes
into the house. I checked the connections, and it is secure, clean, and I
cannot see any problems. Any other jack should experience the same issues.
I really wish I could build my house, and wire it with network connections
throughout so I could put a DSL modem about anyplace in the house. If I move it
closer to the jack to eliminate the cable run to my desk, then I have to run
multiple network cables.

Chances are the issue is outside, possibly at the NID.
So - here's the suggestion - go out to the NID box (the box where the phone
line comes into the house) when you open it up there will be what looks like a
standard phone jack on the inside (somtimes this is used to send the signal
into your house - sometimes its just a open o port for testing).  Plug your DSL
modem in there.  If the problem still occurs the issue is the phone company's
problem.  If the issue clears up - you need to re-run the wiring from the box
into your house (or have someone do it for you).

Basically anything on the from the NID box into the house is on you (unless you
have a maintenance plan with your phone company).  Anything from the NID box
(including the box) out - that's the phone company's issue.  All my DSL issues
were on their end - usually caused by older wiring that went flaky in cold
weather.

Cisco devices, especially the 1RU models will have a slight lean.  It gets
worse with some of the switches with longer chassis lengths.  It gets really
bad when you have a dozen of these all leaning on top of each in a rack.

There are some options to mitigate this, such as reversing the rack ears and
off-setting the mounting point slightly, or mid-mounting is available on some
of the bigger switches.  Cisco has never had a strong rail kit presence for
their smaller routers and switches, but third party options are available. 
Ditto what was said for the rack shelves.

for example, the switch that justin case referred to. will that actually be

are generally under the cisco branding.

Smoke Eater: about 10 years ago (yes it was a long time ago) belkin released a
few routers where the firmware would occasionally hijack your browser page and
redirect you to an advertisement for their parental lock features.
they were initially fairly unapologetic, but they ended up releasing a patch
which either removed the redirect completely or disabled it by default.
i'm not sure.

my life is made worse by IBM too. I kind of wonder if IBM did it as a publicity
stunt for Sun to pump them up a little bit.

This isn't the -old- IBM, they did get a new CEO who is more in favor of
opensource and some of IBM's staple products -really- need a serious overhaul
especially in the GUI department. Sun seems to have a nice blend of opensource
and commercial products.

But the bottomline is with SGI tanking, you really only have a couple of real
players in HPC and only a couple of hardware platforms left. and very little
help with competition against Microsoft. So doing a buy bid for Sun, kind of
hurts them in a way in the short term, but it does get their name talked about
again. People are at least looking at their product offerings, to see how well
the companies fit together and may find stuff they like at a price point that

products. He suffers when the product line gets too big, and this merger
would effectively double the number of products of the company.

Apple has done quite a bit with Objective C, such as adding garbage
collection and blocks, plus 64 bit, which OS X is moving fully to in
10.6 (Snow Leopard). I'm not much of a coder, so I can't really speak
to the difficulty of coding Obj-C. I'd say that using Xcode probably

I see Oracle seriously considering the following -
1. Turn MySQL into Oracle Lite, keeping it comparatively low cost, if not
'free'.
2. Offer 'black box' Oracle appliance servers/cabinets.
2a. Kill off support for the Oracle server product on all other OS platforms
and
2b. only offer a client on those other platforms, forcing those that want to
use updated Oracle into the hardware-based solution.

IF they do 2, they risk goign out of business, quickly.
1... could have a huge payoff, if they get the pricing right.

Never.  Instead, you'll see Oracle doing what Microsoft did with Office
and Windows core: make sure that Oracle runs on every OS platform under
the planet, but runs blazingly fast/well under Solaris.  Even if that means
that you have to break the other OS versions.

I sometimes forget that Chris Mason isn't just "the btrfs guy", but is actually
*the* Linux kernel guy at Oracle.  So, while he clearly has a vested interested
in btrfs, he'd probably keep his job even if btrfs got deep sixed.  So, when he

thinks that's the truth.  Of course, the proof of the pudding will be where

Any guesses at how long HP will support Tru64 on Alpha?  I've seen the
roadmap ( http://h30097.www3.hp.com/pdf/Tru64%20roadmap%20march09.pdf ) so
I know they EOLed the hardware in 2007-2008 and are promising support 5.1B-n
"at least through 2012."  But I'm wondering how far beyond that it's likely
to last.

Work's had Alpha boxen since at least 1999, and since they run unique
custom software (which cost $millions) to control similarly unique
equipment ($hundreds-of-millions), I figure the eventual migration won't
be pretty... or cheap.  Thankfully, I don't have to do that migration -
but I have to use the beasts before, during and after.

great, but, really, its days were numbered the moment HP bought Compaq.  HP's
already got HP/UX and Linux to keep it plenty busy; Tru64 is only alive on
legacy platforms.  Hell, Alpha, itself, was dead in '07 or so -- killed by the
insanely moribund Itanium.  64-bit's really been a cluster for a bunch of
vendors; that being said, I kinda wish Alpha had had broader acceptance; it
kicked some serious ass.

With the move to grid/utility/cloud/buzzword computing, the appeal of
having big boxes is clearly swinging the other direction for this
iteration of computing.  Looks like, according to Wikipedia, the
'smallest' machine on sale supports 1-8 processors. So big box

and the folks who wrote the custom stuff are really reluctant to port things to
Linux (they've been forced to do so in the past, at times) because they want to
be able to pay hardware and OS vendors some amoun (large, I suspect) for a
(high) level of support, and they feel it's easier to do that with Tru64 or
Solaris or whatever.  And he said that if/when HP _does_ EOS Tru64 on Alpha,
"we" (which thankfully doesn't mean me) and the custom software people are
going to have a problem, because any port will probably have to take endian
issues into account, plus they might have to re-write the whole GUI depending
on what UI toolkits are available, and so on and so forth.

Yeah, I wouldn't be eager to stick with Sun kit post-acquisition either...
neither Solaris nor SPARC seem to be gaining much market share.

I'd be even less eager to have anything to do with HP/UX on Itanium, which
seems to be about the least popular server CPU architecture going (doesn't
help to release chips in 2010 that were on the roadmap for 2007, folks!)

So as far as non-"commodity" options, that leaves AIX on IBM POWER, and
since these Alpha/Tru64 boxen are really mostly front-ends that aren't
doing lots of heavy lifting, I doubt it's worth it.

Throw in that my workplace is one of about a dozen places here doing
research in the same area, and that among the others I'm aware of, the
last 5 years have seen a lot of servers replaced by Linux boxen, and
the desk clutter of having a PC for the office network, a SPARC for
visualization, and a PowerBook for portability has yielded to a single
Mac(Book) Pro with Boot Camp and VMware, and big-ass flat panel(s) in
the space those other computers used to take up. :)

So my guess is that in a couple years, the people who worry about getting
proper support contracts for Linux systems will have it explained to them
that we can get X64-based ProLiant gear, running RHEL, with proper support
contracts, and be told to STFU and port their code already. ;)

I'd be even happier if the kit was even more commodity-grade, since we
don't need server-spec gear for front-ends.  Mil-spec SSDs with 35K'
operating ceilings might come in handy, though...

I've worked at a couple of businesses which needed various mainframe terminal
emulation software.  The most common reason for the additional expense is that
there's a team of data-entry or operations folk who learned how to do all of
their job functions by rote using particular functions keys or key combinations
on dumb terminals, and for one reason or another they company didn't want to
force them to retrain.  (It's probably not a coincidence that both businesses
had clerical unions)  An alternative, even if it displayed the screen
correctly, would change those mappings.

Occasionally an application will use a mainframe graphic
package for something like a (to use one example) a thermal control system, and
that package only works properly in emulation of a obscure terminal.

That said, your client is more than likely getting soaked; there are web
terminal gateways that can be licensed and open-source packages that can be
modded.  Anything off the shelf there's probably an easy solution; if the
product is customized, as is most often the case, companies often decide to pay
big bucks in the short term to not have to think about it, assuming they'll
migrate the apps before it makes sense to get a cheaper terminal emulation
software.  And after making that decision in 1996...

The smart ones have already figured out they made a mistake and figured out
a way around it that is inclusive of what you are already doing.
And they usually admit it right up front which relieves a TON of tension.
They have probably also designed a way out of the situation upfront in
case they did make a mistake.

The Smart people, or the not so smart people who have this need to prove
to the world they are the smartest are the worst to work with because they

I did my PhD in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
My apartment window looked out at the building Wolfram Research is in, and I
hung out with a group of grad students and local geeks on Tuesday nights at an
event we called "Beer Tuesday".  A few of these geeks worked for Wolfram
Research and had some good stories to tell.

Apparently it's a semi-frequent occurrence for Stephen Wolfram to get upset at
people and just "fire" them outright.  I guess this generally means that you go
home and wait a day or two and then come back into work like nothing happened.

One of my friends got yelled at or maybe "fired" one time when he was using a
copy of _A_New_Kind_Of_Science_ to prop a door open.

Mostly Stephen's brother Conrad runs the business.  Stephen only comes to
Champaign a few times a year.  I've seen him lecture a few times.  Although
he's a physicist by education, I believe he has some kind of appointment with
the CS department at UIUC.

Apparently Wolfram feels some kind of rivalry with Stephen Hawking, because if
Hawking wasn't around then Wolfram would be the undoubted top British
physicist.  I always used to tell my friends from Wolfram Research to bring
Wolfram's home phone number to Beer Tuesday and that I'd bring my old Speak And
Spell and we'd prank call him.

Well, yeah, stuff's been ported -- but the only reason the platform exists is
for support of old stuff.  I find it insanely doubtful that any new
applications are (say) being *written* on VMS, and ported to *nix.  But there
are still enough people who enjoyed VMS in its time (*raises hand*), and enough
extant locations, that it makes sense to port some stuff to VMS.  Hell: Firefox
was ported to the Amiga; I *LOVELOVELOVED* the Amiga in its time, but I'm not
sure there's enough of a userbase to bother porting ping to it, any more.

I just read a few days ago in the release notes for Python 3.3 that it is no
longer maintained on OS/2 and VMS due to nobody volunteering to do so.

My undergraduate education was all taught on VMS and eventually I became a VMS
systems programmer full-time for a few years at my university after graduating.
It indeed is/was a great operating system, although it definitely suffers
because it reflects the "monolithic" style of thinking from the period in which
it originated.  You tend to write more monolithic programs to do things, or at
the very least create a DCL script to create some workflow consisting of
several programs and a bunch of temporary files.  Contrast this with the "pipe"
style of hooking together applications in Unix.  I think that's fairly
valuable and something I'm not sure DEC ever really understood.

autism and gluten-free diets> I don't think that would necessarily create an

good idea to stay away from processed foods because we tend to react to the

        That depends upon whether the sensitivity is caused by gluten itself,
or a byproduct of gluten. Those who restrict gluten intake are, by default,
removing a big chunk of dietary carbohydrates- barley, rye, wheat, and spelt;
most would also include oats, as although they don't contain the offending
proteins specifically, they are often processed on machinery that may
cross-contaminate oats with wheat gluten.
        So the question becomes- is it removal of the wheat, or is it the
reduction in carbohydrates? One could argue that large quantities of dietary
starch have ill effects on the gut of the developing child- not all, certainly,
but if there is a genetic susceptibility, this could be the case. Note that a
number of individuals have found that intravenous vitamins have shown a
reduction in symptoms in *some* austistic children. So- purely hypothetically:
bacterial overgrowth in the gut, caused by consumption of long-chain
carbohydrates, leads to reduced absorbtion, or even "leaky gut" in which
nutrients are lost. Note also that wheat itself is an "anti-nutrient," and that
white bread is (by law) fortified in the UK and the United States as it is
depleted in nutrients.
        Now, it's been a while since I had Biochem I and II, but I seem to
recall that there are a number of strange neurological defects that occur when
the developing child is deprived of certain vitamins and nutrients at the wrong
time of development. From this perspective, it doesn't seem like a huge leap to
say that too much wheat could result in specific nutrient deficiencies which in
turn cause autism-like symptoms in a small segment of the population.

And of course, assuming that the child in question has a pre-existing
sensitivity to wheat. I'm all for allergy testing, and as soon as possible if
autism is suspected. It's the first thing I tell parents who come to me with
"My child's been diagnosed autistic, what do I do?" I've read research
published in New Scientist which posits that the difference between autistic
and neurotypical children is not really in their brains, but in their guts.
They simply can't digest certain proteins as well as other children and THAT
affects the brain. This explains why simple dietary changes are often enough to
see drastic improvement. The only reason why I'm not quick to jump onto the
gluten-free bandwagon is that the most frequent allergy that autistic children
have is milk, more specifically, the protein casein. This may or may not come
along with lactose intolerance, so just because the milk goes down with no
problem does not mean that an allergy couldn't be at work. I didn't develop
lactose intolerance until my late teens. And yet when people ask me what my
drug of choice is, I say cheese, because for me, it is. I can't keep it in the
house and the cheese craving gets particularly bad when I'm stressed out. It's
my Xanax. And of course, the peculiar thing about food allergies is that you
end up craving what you're allergic. I still eat cheese on occasion because
even though it causes behavioral changes, they are not disruptive ones. Anyway
milk allergy is so common among autistic children, and the often drastic
improvement that frequently happens once milk is removed from the diet, that it
has it's own name, "milk allergy autism". But this is not to speak for ALL
autistic people. Everyone has their own unique set of allergies and
sensitivities.

As for supplementation, it's been discovered, and there is a lot of anecdotal
evidence about improvement with supplementation, that autistic people
apparently need more vitamin B6, calcium and magnesium than other people. I
don't know quite why that is, but it's probably related to the digestive
difficulties we have. (And the ensuing gas, oy!) Anyway, supplements have
really helped me and the difference is obvious to my friends, so when I start
acting up or more scattered, having touch issues or just not picking up on
social cues, they ask whether or not I remembered to take my B vitamins, and if
they have to ask, then I forgot. That's how obvious the difference is. So thank
goodness for dietary modification and supplementation because it is what keeps
me employable.

        Note also that at least one of the wackos pointing to the gluten-autism
link also point to a potential link between lactose and autism. If the
individual lacks the ability to process lactose, then it, too, "feeds" bacteria
in the gut. This is nothing new, of course. But once again- is this enough to
feed enteroadherent bacteria that restrict nutrient absorption?

Not all of this is wacko stuff, though anything coming out of the mouth of
Jenny McCarthy is. I just want to smack that bitch. Her son is going to be a
total basket case because all she's doing is teaching him that everything about
him is bad and evil and wrong. Diet modification does work, though it has to be
individually tailored, but it's no cure. It doesn't cure autism; all it does is
make you more functional.

But as a functional autistic person, I strongly resent the notion that I need
to be cured of anything. The only way you can cure me is by killing me because
the stuff I can't do would literally require me to be born with a different
brain. I also can do stuff that most neurotypical people *can't* do. It makes
me a damn good proofreader, for instance, and I'm pretty sure my dad's autism
makes him damn good at his job. I don't know too many 69-year-olds who can
learn a new programming language in two days like he can.

I've suffered more from discrimination than I've ever suffered from autism.
What people with autism need is ACCEPTANCE. If you manage to rid the world of
autism, you can pretty much kiss much of the advanced sciences goodbye, since a
high number of people working in those fields are autistic, and autism gives
them the means to work on those things. EINSTEIN was autistic. If he were
"cured", would he have come up with the Theory of Relativity? Probably not.
He'd have been too busy going to parties rather than sitting at home working on
it. NEWTON, if he wasn't autistic, he was certainly profoundly weird and so was
his contemporary Liebniz. So anytime I see an ad pleading for money to "cure"
(read: exterminate) autism, I want to puke. I'm all for any therapy that helps
an autistic person become more functional in society, but it is grossly unfair
that the autistic person is expected to fit in at all costs with absolutely no
tolerance of their difference, even though it is that difference that is often
useful to society.

But then we live in a society that is becoming increasingly scientifically
illiterate, so what should we expect?

I feel for your situation Cadenza, but it is worth noting that a lot of

many have severe educational problems.  I used to work in a school that had a
large autistic support wing, and believe me those kids weren't little geniuses.
 Quite the opposite.  One of my colleagues had an autistic son and she was
dreadfully anxious about the future for him.  He was going to struggle to get
any qualifications and he found functioning in society extremely difficult.
Was he ever going to hold down a job?  How do you cope with that as a parent?

So I can understand why some people would leap at a 'cure' if they could find

By all means, we should help autistic children become more functional. On the
other hand, getting to the point where one can function in society is made
unnecessarily difficult by the prejudices and hostility of the neurotypical
people who are unable to accept anyone who is different.

The discrimination is real. I've lost jobs when people found out I was
autistic. And people tell me, "I wouldn't know you were autistic" like it's a
big compliment, when it really isn't. All it says is that I've gotten REALLY
GOOD at going underground in order to avoid being found out, because being
found it usually means, loss of a job, loss of housing, loss of friends,
violence against my person. This is what it's like to be autistic in today's
society. And yet, we make autistic behaviors the problem, and not society's
utter intolerance of them. Do you know that parents rarely get prosecuted if
they murder their autistic children? We aren't considered fit to live by the
rest of society.

I've suffered far more from other people's prejudice and discrimination than
I've ever suffered from autism. The worst bits, the bits that affect me
personally, I've been able to manage with a good diet and supplementation. The
rest, I have no control over, because of other people's unreasonable reactions
and expectations. Therapy was a non-starter, because the therapist would always
expect me to be at her level, and my communication skills, particularly when
talking about emotions, just isn't up there, and she would refuse, on
principle, to come down to my level. However, what she was asking me to do was
impossible. It was like expecting a quadriplegic to get up and walk. And every
therapist put me in that exact same predicament.

It IS easier to be physically disabled. When I had trouble walking, no one
expected me to get up and run a marathon. Yet, that is what people expect me to
do on a social level, and while I've gotten a hell of a lot better over the
years, it's extraordinarily difficult. And I can't just tell people I'm
autistic, because people have no idea what it is. And generally would cause me
to lose my job, lose a friendship or have violence against my person. Most
people think autistic=crazy, and they often react with extreme violence. When I
was a kid, other parents thought it perfectly ok to hit me and scream at me
because since I was an autistic kid, I had no feelings (according to them). Do
you have any fucking idea what an utter mindfuck it is to be told that you
aren't human and that you don't have any feelings while you are bawling your
eyes out?

Well, most ELISAs have an arbitrary endpoint:  you bind the primary, then the
secondary, then add the colorimetric or fluorescent substrate and let the
protein conjugated to the second antibody (alkaline phosphatase, for example)
chew away at the substrate and give your readout.  At timepoint X (5 min, or
whatever), you stop the reaction by washing away the substrate (sometimes in
conjunction with a quencher, such as phosphate buffer, in the case of alkaline
phosphatase), and then read on the plate.

But this is the same sort of thing as a Western, and if you have a
densitometer, you can get quantification of the darkness of the band or lane.

Actually, the densitometer-ish thing I've used in the past is a Bio-Rad model:
from looking at their website right now, I think it was the Molecular Imager
GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer.

If not, it was something similar.  The nice thing about it is that you didn't
have to use film:  just slap a wet gel down on the scanner, or a Western, and
it would digitally process the image for you.  The software would output (I
think) an Excel sheet of the band density values as one of the optional
settings.

The only issue I can see, really, is making sure that your primary antibody is
specific.  I'm not aware of what anti-bacterial-strain-X antibodies are on the
market:  I could see there being, say, an anti-peptidoglycan antibody, but that
would just test for bacteria in general.


Or, since you mentioned pure culture, are you planning on growing the bacteria
and making your own antibodies?  Or do you have a source for
Klebsiella-specific antibodies already?

Semen Quality Linked to Intelligence
Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News

Measuring Fitness
Measuring Fitness | Discovery News Video


Dec. 15, 2008 -- Past studies have linked an individual's intelligence to his
or her height, cardiovascular function and longevity, but now a new study
suggests semen quality may be added to that list, since it also appears to help
predict the level of a man's intelligence.

The findings as a whole suggest that both intelligence and semen quality are
fitness traits -- characteristics evolved to promote survival -- that are
influenced by genetics.

Other studies on twins of both sexes, and on adopted individuals, have
demonstrated that, by middle age, a person's smarts are highly influenced, and
at least partially predicted, by genetic makeup.

Brain activity and semen quality would seem to have little connection, but
that's one reason why lead author Rosalind Arden, a King's College London
researcher, and her team decided to study a possible link.

"Scientists know that intelligence is correlated with many other
characteristics, but the reason is a puzzle," Arden told Discovery News. "We
chose a trait -- sperm quality -- that seems to be quite unrelated to
intelligence to test our general idea."

She and her colleagues analyzed data gathered on thousands of U.S. Army
veterans enrolled in the Vietnam Experience Study conducted by the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control in 1985. Out of 4,462 study participants, 425 provided
semen samples that were scientifically evaluated at the time.

The men also took five I.Q.-measuring tests. Arden's team used computer
analysis to study that data, along with the semen determinations. The
researchers found that a man's intelligence positively correlated with three
key indicators of his semen quality: sperm concentration, sperm count and sperm
motility.

The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Intelligence.

"Most genes probably affect multiple traits -- this is strongly supported
experimentally," Arden explained, saying that we all carry genetic mutations at
varying levels.

"Aside from the number of mutations we carry, their harmfulness varies," she
added. "The specific mutations we carry are also on our lottery ticket."

This genetic "lottery ticket," as she calls it, may then lead to an overall
level of fitness that seems to affect all aspects of a person, including brain
and sexual organ function.

"Sometimes people are surprised that intelligence can be measured because it
seems to be such a diverse quality," she said. "But beauty is a diverse quality
too. The celebrated beauty of the actors Gong Li or Angelina Joli stand out,
but their loveliness is not just in the nose or the angle of the cheekbones."

Like beauty, Arden believes intelligence is both a fitness and a summary trait,
meaning that our perception of it is comprised of many different components.
Braininess is additionally influenced by a person's environment, quality of
education, health care, dedication to studies, accidents and illness that could
impair thinking and more.

"It's crucial to understand that nobody claims intelligence is all that
counts," she said. "Intelligence, like beauty, may be 'bundled' with avarice,
vanity and deceit. Lack of intelligence may be 'bundled' with compassion,
virtue and generosity. Neither biological fitness nor intelligence capture all
of what we value and esteem about others."

David Buss, a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin,
told Discovery News that the new study is "fascinating" and may be "the first
of its kind."

Look up information on antibiotic filter disc assays.

In most cases, culture is spread on an agar plate, filter paper discs
inoculated with a given concentration of an antibiotic are placed on the agar
plate.  If the concentration kills or strongly inhibits growth, there will be a
clear (or at least less dense) area around the given disc.


Alternatively, you can buy deep-well microtiter plates, in 24, 48, or 96 wells.
Many of them have clear bottoms, so you could do a standard OD600 reading
through the culture.

And they come with lids that can ensure the culture stays in place while on a
shaker overnight.  Alternatively, you can put clear tape across the top (though
there may be issues with oxygen depletion), or, I think, even a few kinds of
gas-permeable tape on the market.

with SLS. The second set of experiments is with some macrolide antibiotics for
which there are no disks available, or Etest strips, either, best as I can see.
So, for those, I will probably have to make some broth cultures with antibiotic

They probably covered this in biology class but I slept through it.

When is a person's DNA determined?

I was thinking that sperm meets egg and then one of each parents' genes
gets randomly given to the kid.

So if Dad's sperm has genes D1D2 and Mom's egg has genes M1M2, the kid
has a 1 in 4 chance of being each of D1M1 D1M2 D2M1 D2M2.

However, I remember hearing that one can influence sex selection by
interfering with sperm.  The sperm with the X-chromosome are
distinguishable from the sperm with the Y-chromosome by weight, and
you can mess with them in a lab to noticeably change the odds of getting
one sex or the other.

That implies that selection -- at least some of it -- happens long
before sperm meets egg.  Some sperm makes boys and some makes girls.
Is this true for other traits, like bloodtype?

Let's say Dad has one allele for bloodtype A and one allele for
bloodtype O.  Assuming you had good enough technology, could you find
each sperm that had the O and make sure only those got near the egg?

Or is X-versus-Y chromosome selection different from others?  If so, why?

Well, gametes (sperm and eggs) have half the number of chromosomes of normal
cells.  My limited understanding of this is that which half is random.  But
gender is complicated and is actually determined by lots and lots of genes on
two chromosomes (the XX or XY chromosomes).  Sperm has either X or Y; eggs have
only X.  It's a lot easier to pick out a change in a whole chromosome than to
look for a difference of one gene.  Selecting, say, Y chromosome sperm is going
to be orders of magnitude easier than finding say, blue eye gene sperm.  And
you'd need to consider the egg too in that case.

In a perfectly Mendelian situation, yeah, you have the standard Punnett square
situation on genes (D1M1, D2M1, D1M2, D2M2).

But recombination isn't perfect:  you don't get perfect scrambling of each and
every single gene between the two copies (one on each chromosome) before you
get the single-chromosome gamete.  So, if you have A1B1C1D1E1 genes on one
chromosome, and A2B2C2D2E2 on the other chromosome, you're more likely to get
something like A1B1C1D2E2 rather than something like A1B2C1D2E1.  The fact that
you tend to inherit chunks from chromosomes is one of the things that makes
gene hunting using the SNP map (single-nucleotide-polymorphism) possible:  if
persons A, B, and C have a disease and share SNP53, then the gene (or one of
the genes) responsible is likely to be near to SNP53 on whatever chromosome. 
If nothing else, it narrows down the possibilities.


For sex determination, yeah, XX and XY are the "standard" ones, but you can get
cases where an egg or sperm gets two copies rather than just one, or something
else where you can get a person where their secondary sex characteristics don't
match their genetic sex.

You can also "assist" the gender selection by the timing of intercourse.  Since

Huh, learn something every day.  The current way that pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis is done, from what I gather, is to fertilize eggs with sperm and then
examine the resulting embryos for whatever genetic profiles you want (usually
stuff like Tay-Sachs or Downs).

It's pretty invasive, and there are ethical considerations about creating
embryos.  If one could somehow isolate the sperm with the specific markers
that are needed and do artificial insemination, it's much less invasive,
and many (although of course not all) of the ethical issues are addressed.

I assumed we don't have anywhere near that level of technology as of yet
required to do this.  Glad I got that one right at least.

I just read somewhere that in bees, if the queen is gone, some of the workers
will begin to produce unfertilized eggs (since they've never taken a mating
flight like the queen).  Because of this, all their eggs will become drones (or
males).

How is this possible?  Shouldn't an unfertilized egg be an exact clone of its
mother?

        Yeah- some poikilotherms can do that. Turtles for certain. For some,
the genetic "decision" is presumably epigenetic, and can switch between the
two, particularly when one gender or the other gets scarce.
        We know it's epigenetic in some plants that have "genders." Some
orchids can have male and female flowers on the same inflorescence. Most (all?)
cycads are male or female, and one of my buddies did some work with chemically
"changing" that. Ditto with nepenthes, the tropical pitcher plants; this is of
importance with one species that is known from three male clonal lines, and
(possibly) one female clonal line. There's been some interest in getting one of
the male lines to throw female flowers so a little more genetic diversity can
be inspired; there's some doubt the one female line is actually the pure
species, and not a hybrid.

I don't know all of the cases, but one of the most common is where the
recessive version is functionally weaker in some way.  If you have a strong
signal that is sufficient for "normal" even at one copy level, then DD or Dd is
going to look the same.  It would only be with dd would you get some kind of
different phenotype.

This can also be the case with a dominant negative mutation, where the
wild-type version winds up being "recessive" due to the effects of the mutant.

I want to say that they're trying to use a dominant negative effect against...
anthrax toxin?  Some kind of toxin anyway, that oligomerizes to form a pore for
transport of something else.  The idea is that a dominant negative mutant
monomer could be injected and prevent pore formation, thereby preventing the
lethal effect of the toxin.

I was listening to the Naked Scientist podcast the other day  and someone asked
why the left hand side of the brain controls the right hand side of the body,
and vice versa (http://bit.ly/aPh8x3 OR
http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/latest-questions/question/2676/)

The neuroscientist that answered it made several interesting points, and one
was that scientists have been thinking theoretically about how can you wire up
a clever brain just on first principles, and decided that probably, its useful
to wire things crossed over because it reduces the liklihood of 'wiring
errors'.

Anyway, I thought of it because you might imagine there'd be a logic to having
both hands controlled by the same bit of the brain.  After all they both carry
out the same sorts of actions.  But they're not, your right hand is controlled
by the left-hand side of your brain and vice versa.

And it maybe just that in the majority of people one half of the brain is
better at managing the fine motor control, and so that hand becomes dominant.
So basically what I'm saying is it's just an artefact that arises from the way
our brains are put together.

There's a couple reasons.  One is their ears are mobile, so they can move them
in the direction of sound and that helps them gather sound better than humans
can, and it helps them locate things by sound easier.  The dog prototype has
ears that are shaped to gather sound better, too (it's only our selective
breeding that gives them floppy ears, left on their own dogs tend to revert to
a prick ear shape).

Dogs can hear both higher frequencies, and they hear softer sounds better than
humans.  Sounds humans are fine with can be too loud for dogs.  I would suspect
that as for them being able to hear high pitches better than humans, it has to
do with the hair cells.  When humans lose their hearing as they age, high
pitches are usually the first thing to go, and it's documented that damage to
the hair cells is a cause for the hearing loss.

I'm a chemist not a biologist, and I'm trying to get my head around simple
plant reproduction :-S

Is this right?

So... the pollen grain reaches the stigma, where it grows a pollen tube through
the style down to the ovary of the plant.  In the ovary there are ovules, and
in the ovules there are eggs.  Once the nucleus of the pollen cell reaches the
egg, fertilisation occurs and the ovule ultimately turns into a seed.

I'm mainly having trouble with the difference between ovule, ovary and ovum
(egg?), and I just want to check I'm not misusing the terms :-)

I assume you're talking flowering plants (angiosperms)?

http://www.prairiefrontier.com/pages/flwrfamlys.html   Scroll just a smidge for
a pretty picture!  It has a diagram of a flower.

The pollen from the anther
lands on the stigma (it has a sticky layer on the flat portion).  The pollen
tube germinates from the grain of pollen, and it grows through the stigma, the
style, and the ovary where it is guided to the opening at one end of the ovule.
There is an egg cell in the ovule, and two synergid cells to either side of the
egg cell.  The pollen tube grows into one of the
synergid cells, which is degenerating.  The tube stops growing, ruptures, and
releases two sperm cells.  One migrates to the egg cell and creates the embryo,
the other migrates to the remaining synergid cell and makes the endosperm.

You know, after writing that, I'm entirely unsure that I answered your
question.

Yes I think you have... my main problem was the difference between ovule and
egg.  Some places say (or imply) they're the same thing, but others suggest
they are different things.  I want to be clear in my own head.  But what you've
said is that there's a egg cell in the ovule, so that's quite clear.  It's just
that, unlike in animal reproduction, there are two sperm cells and one joins
with the egg while the other joins with another, different, cell.  It's also
useful to know that the pollen grain isn't exactly analogous with sperm; it
-contains- sperm cells.

If it helps, think of the ovule as the structure that creates and contains the
eggs.  Also, the basic explanation I gave was for flowering plants.  It's
different for  different types of plants, just like for animals it's different
for mammals and birds and reptiles.  Also, some things have been left out that
belong in the ovule of a flowering plant, but you have the basics.

Four years, 80 people, one million spiders and one cape

The main star of a project by Englishman Simon Peers were the female Golden Orb
spiders in the highlands of Madagascar. A cape made completely out of spider
silk took four years to make. On average it takes 23,000 spiders to gather 1
ounce of silk. The one of a kind cap is now on display at the Victoria and

spider is a naturally golden color.

"I have a fig (Ficus sp.) tree. It WAS doing horribly with lack of attention

construction dust choking its leaves, as well as cats tearing at its bark.
About 2-3 weeks ago, I gave it a shower (the thing stands about 12ft high)...
and have been watering it consistently. It's doing MUCH better, and growing new
branches and leaves. I have noticed some entirely NEW branches which I did not
expect.

My query is: Can I somehow encourage the growth of entirely new branches to get
the tree back to its former glory (again, we're well on the way, but I'd like
to direct it...)

For instance, can a nick the bark and out a branch will come (perhaps with the
assistance of a powdered hormone), can I attempt grafting (i.e., remove a
healthy young branch and insert it elsewhere to create desired shape? Fig trees
have many tiny 'pimples', and that seems where the branches grow from... How
can I trick it to putting one "there" as opposed to "there..." "

chocolates or such.  Anyway, we did CDs of our "theme" music -- classic vocal
jazz.  Frank Sinatra and the like.  THe first few songs were our first dance,
parent's dance, etc.  Then we filled out the rest with favorites.  The DJ used
it during the reception, so it was like our wedding soundtrack.  Plus, it's
such classic music that everyone loved it, and we get comments years later how
great it is, and requests for replacements for worn out copies.  We made them
ourselves, and printed the labels and inserts with nice photos (not of us, but
of the place in Greece where we had gotten engaged.)  All together they were
perhaps a couple of dollars each, plus a lot of labor.

They exist (under other names, from what I've seen) in alot of large cities. We
played lazer tag and batting cages and all that stuff, without a million kids
running around, it was alot of fun.
#2 which is more organized, we went on a dinner cruise with dancing and all
that. Granted I lived on Lake Superior at the time, so it worked out well. I
also had alot of fun at parties that were pretty casual but had alot of white

Balloons are good - passing the balloon from one person to another without

(takes some neve that).  In fact if you get a big pack of balloons you can
probably invent 101 games with a little imagination.

Twister is also fun, if you can get one from somewhere (someone usually owns a

Chlorine is a non-essential element except for a select few obligate
halophytes; even then, sufficiency for that element is typically met with the
quantity used in exchange from the EDTA chelate used to bind up iron.

As for sulfur- not much is required for sufficiency. The usual supply is with
magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts), rarely with other sources.

Peter's just isn't all that good. Look at what cannabis growers use- and not
just for the sake of using the most expensive stuff; even the cheapest growers
don't use Peter's. This may be changing, as Peter's is going to come out with a
formulation specifically for marijuana, or so rumor goes. You can bet it won't
rely upon urea.

Urea has two big drawbacks: the first is that it's not readily available. It
has to be metabolized by soil-dwelling bacteria before it can be freed up. More
importantly, it's phytotoxic in this state; I've run axenic tissue cultures
with filter-sterilizing urea, and it flat-out kills plants in sterile culture,
even at equimolar concentrations of nitrogen.

Three words: Awe. so. me.

Lost pretty much all my plants to hot, dry days after watering in the morning
and coming home 11 hrs later to wanting, drooping plants.

Hooks up to your hose spigot. Little UV-resistant poly-line connects to the
plants (you can still run your regular hose to your yard with a "Y"-tee thingy.
Each plant gets its own little dripper for small containers or bubbler spider
sprayer for larger.

Programmable. I have it set to come on three times a day for 20 min (6am, 2pm,
6pm or so).

Working wonderfully. Basil is back in action and setting new leaves very
bushily. Thyme, sage, catnip are perking right back up. Tomatoes are setting
new growth and flowers. Bell peppers the same.

I have seeded beets, carrots, turnip for a fall/winter harvest and will do the
same for lettuces/spinaches/asian greens and other cool season growers for a
fall/winter/spring harvest.

Cost about $150. Paid for itself in not buying produce.

Interesting you should ask.... *evil grin*

Firstly, the setup is on my deck and just off my kitchen, so it is elevated and
extremely convenient for cooking. "Honey, could you go grab me a handful of
basil and one of chives from the deck?"

Secondly, I have two indoor/outdoor cats. Chipmunks and small critters like to
root about and dig out seeds I've planted. This still happens, but much less so
and not to any appreciable degree any more. And my kitties like to leave their
'spoils' on my front patio that they have harvested from their own wild larder.
I just wish they were more frugal and use what they 'bought'.

Thirdly, squirrels are diurnal, as are rabbits... coming out in early mornings
and evenings when it's cool, bedding down in the heat of the day.  Shouldn't
really be an issue for you, no more than myself with the occasional chipmunk.
(see "Secondly" above...)

Fourthly, and this may raise a squirrel tail, I do harvest squirrel and bunny
from my own land.  My pellet gun is dead-on accurate, quick and clean. A
chicken costs $7 here for anything close to organic, bunnies are the cost of a
single pellet. (and just as delicious I might add...)

first grandchild's birthday.

* Your car has a bumper sticker that reads, "I brake for all greenhouses!"

* You may need to take out a small loan to pay your water bill during the
summer months

* The trunk of your car contains clumps of potting soil and a few dried leaves

* You only watch television for the local weather reports

I have a fig (Ficus sp.) tree. It WAS doing horribly with lack of attention and
construction dust choking its leaves, as well as cats tearing at its bark.
About 2-3 weeks ago, I gave it a shower (the thing stands about 12ft high)...
and have been watering it consistently. It's doing MUCH better, and growing new
branches and leaves. I have noticed some entirely NEW branches which I did not
expect.

My query is: Can I somehow encourage the growth of entirely new branches to get
the tree back to its former glory (again, we're well on the way, but I'd like
to direct it...)

For instance, can a nick the bark and out a branch will come (perhaps with the
assistance of a powdered hormone), can I attempt grafting (i.e., remove a
healthy young branch and insert it elsewhere to create desired shape? Fig trees
have many tiny 'pimples', and that seems where the branches grow from... How
can I trick it to putting one "there" as opposed to "there..."

Don't use hay.  Hay is more expensive than straw and I can't see a reason to
use hay over straw.  Hay is usually a grass (like timothy) or a legume
(alfalfa) or clover.  It's harvested green.   Straw is leftover plant material
from cereals after they've been harvested and threshed.  It's got little
nutritional value and it's what they use for barn animals to shit on.

You want straw or grass hay. You want the long fibers, that will be easier
to dig through in a 5 months with a pitchfork.

If you goto a farmer, ask them if they will give you a deal on wet/rotted
hay.. because it isnt going to matter one iota, and in fact it will be
better for the application.

You could actually use grass clippings, but use brown ones. the green ones
suck the nitrogen and water from the soil.

Post Oak over Flower Bed:  I have about 2 inches of acorns "mulching" the end
of a flower bed because no one has cleaned them out in forever.  As they break

need to be concerned about?

I thought I'd been told that oak leaves/acorns falling into a water garden
would be a Bad Thing (TM), but I may be confusing oaks and pecans right now.

Eventually, I intend to put gardenias, narcissus and lycoris bulbs, and
something else in this area.  If I need to rake them out, I can, but if they
are beneficial, I'd rather they stayed.

Composting>  I'd like to compost all my yard waste since I can no longer put it
in a yard waste dumpster and set it at the curb.  Where I live now does not
offer that service.

However, I know a composting bin is not cheap, I'm short of funds, and I have
more pressing expenses than composting.

So, if I just pick a spot in the back of the property and dump clippings and
such in a big pile, how long will it take to break down compared to a
composting bin?  I'm in Fort Worth, and we've had a rather damp spring so far,
but who knows what we'll have this summer.

It is also cheap. I think it is 50lbs for like 5 bucks, and you can

Sorry for the triple.....

Digging up a flower bed>  I discovered the flower bed on the front of the house
is patchy with potting soil, and mostly clay.  I have held off planting
anything except a few bulbs that had to go in the ground or die, and want to
dig it all out to replace with something better for bulbs and other perennials.
 Do I need to go to the expense of using Miracle Grow soil, or will generic
topsoil be just as good?  That's about 120 cubic feet of dirt to replace.

It's about 50 feet by 18 inches, and I figure I'll go about 18 inches deep.
Next year, though, I plan to double the front-to-back distance and expand, so
this is going to hit me twice in the pocket book.

Well if i do it that way.. I -start- with a pile, add lime.. then after
a month or two and the weeds start to pop up, i run over it with the
lawnmower and then add more lime. It is less work then using a pitchfork
or shovel to flip the piles.. :)


For the soil amendments.. I would just mix sand in with the clay for at
least the bottom 12".. You can add topsoil to it too, but really you
are just fighting soil compaction and drainage at the 6-18" range..
I would just add like 3" of sand to the 12 inches of clay and mix it
in with a rototiller.

The -easier- way to do it is to plant something like oilseed radish, or
tillage radish, which will send its taproot about 30" down through
compacted clay to poke holes in it... then mix up the top 4-6" of clay
with say 2-4" of a sand/topsoil mix. You are only growing periannuals.
you don't need a seedbed.

Composting > I make sureto add enough woody stuffs with the grass clippings.
Green grass clippings will eventually compost with turning and lime, but I"ll
often skip the lime and add straw and small branches and even newspaper.

Your cheapest option for growing soil is going to be to have a load of soil
delivered. You can get sifted topsoil for a premium price, but since this is a
garden and not a lawn, you're not worried about any lawnmower spitting a rock
into your windows, get the UNsifted topsoil. I had a 10'x20' area to take care
of, it was less than 120$ for the unsifted topsoil. The rocks left in the
unsifted topsoil are all smaller than my fist, you won't be left with boulders,
and you'll probably save yourself at least 100$ (cuz that's what I saved for my
space)

The woody stuff helps balance the pH. But in theory you should still be adding
lime. However it is more important for green manure..

Topsoil> You can have it delivered.. but if she does it how she first stated,
she is looking at around 4.1 yards of it. It is overkill for what she is
growing, and sand especially in the bottom 12-14" is going to help more
then topsoil. If it was grass, then 1" of topsoil would be dandy since
the roots don't go any deeper then that.. Periannuals, will go deeper but
they might not have enough strength to break through the compacted clay.
They end up just growing in the space of whatever you dug out.. I have
literally pulled out woody bushes and trees out that had roots that grew
in circles for 20 years because they couldnt break through the clay.

Which all brings me back to the suggestion of a radish or mustard that
can actually penetrate the claypan. It is cheap, easy, and effective.
No one -really- wants to dig an 18" deep trench when they can plant a
few seeds and then fill in the holes it leaves with a 50/50 sand/topsoil
mix :)

you have to flip it to break the top layer to let water in, mix it up, etc so
it breaks down faster. If you do that it is just as fast. However, the ease of

Ok, several questions here.... Sorry.

I have 4 long-haired dogs.  I also have those burrs that grow on what looks
like clover with tiny yellow flowers.  But, I also have wildflowers.  It's
taking an hour every evening to comb and pick out the burrs from the dogs.  I'm
working on getting a fence so that they cannot go in the front yard where most
of the stuff is, but in the meantime......

What can I do/use to kill the clover stuff without killing the wildflowers?
I've had it mowed, and now the whole front yard looks dead.  I know it will
recover as soon as it's raked, though.

I know what the wildflowers are, so if I kill them this year, will anything I
use to do it hang around after this season, making tossing out wildflower seed
next season a waste of time?  I have winecups, wild verbena, henbit,
spiderwort, rain lilies, something we always called "wild onions but not sure
if that's their real name, Indian paintbrush, and prairie phlox.

Alternatively, do they make a "yard vacuum" that I could rent?  I have a leaf
blower that will reverse the suction, but this it too much to use that on.

Will a controlled burn (legally allowed in my county) kill it?

And a follow-up composting question on the burrs>  Will they completely break
down if I compost them?  I've got (2) 60-gallon garbage cans full plus (2)
30-gallon bags of yard waste, and they are full of this stuff.  If I'm just
going to replant it elsewhere, I'll go ahead and burn the compost stuff I have
currently have.  It's too much to put in the garbage, and I don't think it's
allowed anyway.

I -think- it might be called "burr clover" I thought it was beggars tick
(sticktight) at first.

If you pull it up and don't kill it. I would use a selective spraying of
roundup on it to kill the existing plants, and put a pre-emergent down to get
them somewhat under control. Since you pulled them up, if you nail them with
roundup, or even 24d, when they are coming back up, you will have better
success. But You want to keep the other broadleaves, so you have to do it by
hand, everything else is going to kill what you want to keep.

selective spraying btw means like using plastic barriers to make sure you don't
overspray and hit what you want to keep.

Sledge, an excellent resource.

I have recently acquired an orchid (Kmart is orchid friendly all-of-a-sudden it
seems). Mine was kept in moderate light (a large room with 6 windows, some
south facing, but orchid was typically sheltered, as the 'directions' said to
keep it out of direct sun.) It maintained well for about a month, with blooms,
an now has dropped blooms and the leaves have gone a paler green (a sign of not
enough sun), so I have placed it close to an Easterly window. :) It has greened
up substantially, and very quickly. Additionally, I bought Orchid specific
fertilizer for it and have fed it once. Once each week, I water with a couple
ice cubes or water straight.

In your situation, I'm sure your not gonna have enough light to support your
plants. They will need to have dedicated light (HEY, great time to put in that
suntube skylight in the bathroom you've always never realized you needed!)

One option they will love are weeklong (or so) holidays in the bath with you.
If you can keep them 3/4 time in the daylight, and bring them into the shower
for brief periods, they love the humidity, and you can lightly shower them to
keep them hydrated and their pores open. I do this even with my 10 ft ficus
every month or two. It started growing new leaves and branches the week after.

Problem is, it's no longer 8ft. :)

When they clean up the mold, make sure it's a remediation company, not just a
some random people who do cleaning.  Also, once the mold has been cleaned up,
have the county health dept come in and do tests to make sure it's truly gone.

When they clean off mold on the inside of walls, I think they actually sand it
off the wood, then paint it with a mold killer/sealer, insulation is removed
and replaced, drywall is replaced.  Ask them what mold remediation company they
are using, and ask the company what they normally do to a house that was used
as a grow house.

Considering they remove as much mold as they can, and put mold retardant on
surfaces that had mold before, I don't think the chances of the mold coming

and it was all redone with marine materials that are mold resistant. With
pourous surfaces, I don't think cleaning is generally enough. I'd maybe look
into that a little bit. We get mold from high humidity (even with the
humidifier sometimes) in the laundry room, but it's all cement and after
talking to a few people found that with cement, and the small amount of mold,
we could scrub it with bleach and a hard bristle brush and it would be alright
as long as we didn't let it spread. It mostly ends up under our water meter
when it "sweats" in the summer.

Cross posting to Animals and Ask>

I bought my mother a tree rose for Mother's Day, and re-potted it with 4
impatiens at the base.  The first time the cats showed interest, I sprayed the
impatiens, the pot, the soil, and the trunk of the rose with Bitter Apple,
which took care of chewing.  All was good.

Until later in the week.....

When they decided to dig the impatiens out and start using the soil for a
litter pan, even though they have a pan and access to the outdoors......

So, we have 1 dead impatien and lots of dirt swept up off the floor and tossed
in the garbage.

I googled and found these options for scent repellents:
   citrus peelings - pricey for a constant supply
   coffee grounds
   blood meal
   ground ginger - Amount??
   cayenne pepper - Amount??
   lavender oil
   lemon grass oil
   citronella oil
   peppermint oil
   eucalyptus oil
   a spray bottle of equal parts vinegar, liquid soap and water

We don't drink enough coffee grounds at home, but we go through it like mad at
work though, and I could bring home what I dump out when I'm the one making
new.  Does anyone have any experience with how well they work?  Do I just toss
them on top of the soil?  Mix it in?

For the cayenne and ginger - I have both in the spice rack, but how much are we
talking?  None of the websites I found information on was discussing amounts.
Are we talking a sprinkle a week or half a can every other day?

Basically the same question for the oils - How much and how long will it last?
I can get any of them locally, but I don't want to spend tons of money on this.
 I'd like to keep the rose inside for as long as possible because she likes it
indoors, but I also do not want to have to sweep up potting soil every day.

As for the last option - a mix of water and vinegar with liquid soap to make it
stick to the leaves - what is that going to do to the plants, especially the
imaptiens, or the soil pH?  Since this is potted and not planted outdoors,
there's no rain to wash any of it away.

TIA!

Phalaenopsis> I got some for 10 bucks on sale from Kroger. They are easy
orchids to grow. The 2 biggest concerns are overwatering, and getting
the leaves wet. The care instructions i have read says to use ice cubes
which does a few things. You don't overwater, chlorine will evaporate,
and you don't get the leaves wet when watering. Only water when the
"roots" are all shriveled up. It is where they store water.

Susannah> just sprinkle the pepper on like you do with salt or pepper
on food. You don't typically measure that either. :) The cajun pepper
actually stings them, sorta of like your mouth from eating spiced food.
It is probably the best bet besides mothballs indoors. coffee grounds
can mold, but they are good for the soil. I occassionally sprinkle it
in my flower beds. I used to do it all the time, but it starts to mold
if you don't take it out every day.

Twice a day is fine. Straw holds water about as well as the scotts stuff.
Straw is harder for a novice to use, because it is bulkier and doesn't spread
as evenly, and doesn't break down as fast.

Just a note. MOST grass mixes contain up to 50% annual ryegrass, which
is a "dummy" grass, that grows fast, but isn't the grass you want.
IIRC The last time I seeded I bought 1 lb of bluegrass and 1 lb of red
fescue for less then i could have bought a 3lb premix bag.

Edging flowerbeds:  What are some easy but effecitve edging options for
flowerbeds?  I currently have that flexible metal around the outside edge, but
I plan to expand the bed over the next year, and at the very least, will have
to buy more.

Here's the rub - Whatever kind of grass I have up next to it is getting through
and over it if I go too long between mowings.  If I get it mowed, the guy who
mows weedeats first around the border and trees, etc.  The grass flies into the
flowerbed every time, and I cannot rake it all out, due to what I have planted.

So, I'm considering a grass-free trench done with an edger or poison or a foot
or so of bricks at dirt level that he can just run the mower along and not have
to weedeat that area.  Any of these cost money (I don't own an edger or enough
extra bricks), and I'm not all that excited about the poison idea.  They all
also have a maintenance factor.

Opinions, anyone?  Other options?

Depending upon the soil, they may not need any fertilizer; bagged soil often
contains fertilizer. Good soil that has mulch in it has plenty of nitrogen in
it. Give it another few weeks; Miracle Gro is pretty shitty stuff- it uses urea
for the nitrogen source. It works; it's just not all that good- but it's
everywhere, and tough to find anything else. Use it at label strength, or half
label strength- it's not going to die from being under-fertilized.

potting soil usually doesnt contain additional fertilizer unless it

the soil, and not guaranteed.

Miracle works, it is pH balanced and contains micronutrients as well as the
macro nutrients. I use it.

You probably aren't going to kill the daisies, they aren't typically that
sensitive.

Just make sure you acclimate them to the natural sunlight by putting them
outside for a few hours a day before permanently leaving them outside.

Not trying to be funny here, but I have a weird question.  A friend of mine
told me, quite seriously, that female dog urine will kill your grass, or at
least discolor it.  I got the impression that grass is not affected (or he
didn't think it was) by a male dog, or another kind of female animal's urine. 
True?

It's no more affected by female urine than it is by male urine.  Repeated
peeing in the same spot is what kills your yard.  And if your dog does that,
you hose the pee spot to water down the urine.

They might think that it's more affected by female urine because male dogs are
much more likely to lift their leg and pee on something rather than squat, so
their pee is much more spread out.  Also, this idea has been around for many
years, prior to the spay and neuter campaigns, so it was when more dogs had
their balls and did lift their legs on everything.

  Hrm. I'm not sure i agree. I feel like I'd pretty much have to hit the
  entire lawn edge to get good coverage. Its not like every inch is bad,
  but if I'm gonna edge, i might as well make it look good. So doing it
  every time and hitting nearly 100% of it, seems like waste.

With our dog, it's very obvious the spots she uses over and over again, pee or

and i have to mow it at least 3x as often as the rest of the yard. But over
time, if she uses the same area it kills the lawn completely. This is
especially obvious in spring. We do clean up in the winter, but we don't get
evverything between snowfalls, and she hates being outside in the winter, so,
when it melts, there is a lovely big section of dog waste that finally settles
onto the lawn, if it's not cleaned very shortly after, no grass at all grows in
that area.

a low-end commercial kombi powerhead from stihl with the weedwhacker and

You are better off with gas, and several attachments like the KM 90,
or better they have enough power are lightweight and nicely balanced.
A single powerhead with multiple attachments is much easier then multiple
tools.

The Battery/electric I don't think have enough power to be a good edger.
and save any time. The electric edger takes twice as long as the gas
edger.

If you are dead set on the battery one, ask if you can change the head on it
to use the polycut blades, or one of the metal blades. They will make
edging easier, as well as cutting brush or thick grass. But if you do
go that route, you have to get a new tool for every job, which is more
space and more maintnance.

  Ha.

  The eletric works 'fine' (which is relative as I don't remember ever using
  any other edger in my life, ever).

  I think you're saying that using the plastic wire crap that comes with it
  is one major issue (I don't believe the fact it is electric matters. at
  least the plugin version shoudl be fine. I can see a battery not lasting
  long enough, but I'm used to that as my lawn mower is a battery and can
  run out if the grass is too long/wet). It disintigrates WAY too fast.
  I assume that is by design so you don't destroy your fences/etc when
  using it normally. But while edging, i want something different. Right?

  I have a 15" WORX .. which doesn't seem to exist on their website....?
  The closet thing I can find is:

  https://www.worx.com/en-US/electric_trimmer_wg117.aspx

  Which appears to 'convert' to an edger, but mine doesn't do that.

  Maybe this is it:
  http://www.lowes.com/pd_383349-54602-WG117_0__?productId=3712882&Ntt=worx
  But my guard is orange, not black. Maybe I should find the manual. heh.

  I also dont' see any accessories that will replace the spool with something
  better for edging.

If you leave your mum in a pot on a porch in winter you'll kill it.  If you
plant them now, they probably won't make it as they work hard on flowering and
not so much root extension.  If you cut all the flowers off and continue to cut
them off they may have a better chance of making it through the winter in the
ground, but then you can't enjoy the flowers.

If you trim them short and cut off the leaves, and keep them in a pot where
they won't freeze, they have a better chance of surviving winter especially if
the temperature doesn't fluctuate much, like an insulated garage or a cool
basement, and keeping it barely moist.

Like about 2x as fast compared to the corded electric tools I have used
and your complaint is really that it is going fast enough to get the job done
in a reasonable amount of time. That being said, if you -keep- up with the
edging, you can get away with a lessor tool. IE go rent/borrow a gas edger
do it once right, then keep it up.

Or alternatively, just get a flat bladed shovel, and edge it by hand once.
do about 1-2" back and about 2" down, and your string trimmer should be able
to handle the rest.

If you want to redneck it a bit, you can just remove the string holder, and
attach a circular saw blade or a dado blade to make an edger. Just don't stand
directly behind the blade, just like a table saw.. :) I think there might
be an instructable on it.

You can also see if you can get a polycut or metal stihl head will fit your
the head of your trimmer, but I wouldn't put bets on it.

What is the best way to totally kill off an in-ground hornet nest? We have one
near our woodpile that is under a railroad tie (that is set into the ground, so
we can't just move it). We emptied one can of fogger today, a bunch came out
and died but there are still a whole lot more pissed off hornets in the hole.
It's an area we use frequently with our kids and we need to get rid of this
next. Thoughts? More fogger? Something else? And no, we can't just light it on
fire, we have extremely dry conditions and fire restrictions and don't really
want the yard, the wood pile and our house to go up in flames, lol. We cannot
see the actual nest, it's too far in the ground, we can only see the small
(quarter sized) hole the hornets come in and out of.

Use ant and spider spray, or ant and something, it doesn't fog as much but the
same stuff that is in Raid hornet spray, but IIRC it is stronger and usually
cheaper. :) Then wait until it is totally dark, and they are all in the
nest. Do not shine a flashlight directly on the hole. stick the nozzle right
in the hole, shut the flashlight off or put it off to the side away from you,
then dump the whole can in the hole, and plug it up.

You need to make sure they are all in the nest, and you are trying to
fumigate them and not get stung. :) They can't see you in no light, and
they aren't going to sting you if they can't get out..

NOW once you plugged the hole wait about 15 minutes, with the flashlight off
go back and listen to see if you can -hear- them, if you can't start shining
your flashlight around looking for them. They might have another hole. :)

You may -also- have gotten the ones that were alive in the nest, and the
new ones are hatching. :) hornet spray doesn't get the larvae in a capped
cell. But the ant and crawling bug spray should also stick around, and
they have to walk on it to get out. :)

Well, if it were a case of many thousands we'll just wait a week or so until we
have several below freezing mornings and they'll be done and then we'll destroy
the nest, lol. We'd just rather be able to use our firepit before it gets too
chilly in the evenings. If we had to call someone, they would have to come from
like 100 miles away, so we'd rather not do that. My understanding is that with
the hornets we have here, only the queen survives to hibernate in the winter.
Considering we use our fire pit regularly from April to October, I doubt it's a
huge nest. We would have noticed them beforehand if that was the case, I would
think. I do work by the firepit cutting wood, mowing, watering plants, all the
time and have never seen a hornet anywhere in our yard until this week.

editing and rewriting. I wouldn't think that you have to do a complete rewrite,
but start here:

1) Read your own story over, front to back. Just based on the experience you
have gained *since* writing this first novel, you will notice things you can do
better.

2) The previous step will give you opportunities to rewrite/edit sections. Take
copious notes or markups in the previous step and use these to focus your
editing.

3) If larger areas would benefit froma complete rewrite, consider it. Also
consider how this rewrite will affect the rest of the story. Is the style of
writing going to be different?

Between reading your own story several times and editing many more times, these

    Our days on the road, fugitives, passed by in a vague blur I didn't much
remember, except for the still-frames.  The highlight reel, back when the world
had televisions.  Like a long car ride on a highway with a compatriot.  You
know you had a good conversation but damned if you could recall the specific
content.  That was our flight down highway sixty-three, or what passed for it,
only the conversation was non-verbal, consisting of mute, shared observations
about things we always wished we hadn't seen.  The highlights are cliches.  I
used to have time to wonder whether years of editing bad writing conditioned me
to spot cliches.  Or to turn everything into one.

    There were the usual abandoned cars, some dark stains on the pavement that
we knew to be blood, arranged in patterns that would have resembled a Rorshach
test had they been more symmetric.  Disorder seems to necessitate aymmetry,
like being awoken at odd hour of the night.  Who is ever awoken at an even
hour?  A set of striped stains at the heels of a blackened frame.  Blood
leaking between rib changes?  Etched into the pavement by heat.

    Tyger, tyger.  Burning bright.  In the forests of the night.
    What immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?

    Allan insisted on checking every car for food.  I insisted on the safety of
ditches and thickets.  Allan counter-insisted that anybody else we ran into
would already be hiding there, and considering that every bullet anybody could
have found to fire was long ago spent, open space and distance were our
defenses, not ditches full of thatch.  He had a point.

    Filthy.  Weeds overgrown through the cracks, now brown and bent.  The
world's stillness was oppressive.  For most of four days, the wind couldn't
even be troubled to move.  A world holding its breath, but in anticipation of
what?  I wondered, stepping over what looked like part of an incinerated golf
bag but could have as easily been the inedible portion of a body, caught in the
fire like everybody else.  My ankles were raw from the leg irons.  My feet felt
wet in my shoes, though I knew that was impossible.

    Highlights.  Still frames captured from blurry film.  The down power lines,
with black cables snaking across the road.  We instinctively stepped over them
for no reason.  A superstition pounded into us as children which strangely
survived the cataclysm intact when so little else did.  I suppose when the sum
total of medical treatment available to you is a turnicate made from whatever
clothing you can spare in the chill, you avoid injuries.  Die fast if you must
die.  A spread of bullet casings, cars without windows, their skin pocked with
abuse.

    Did He Smile His work to see?  Did He who made the lamb make thee?

    Were they clouds or just shades of gray in an ashen sky?  A cloud could
rain, and the dry earth entertained no such overtures.  I would have welcomed
the sound of thunder.  Stillness, and silence.  The deep breath.  I recalled my
college jujitsu courses.  Breathing was integral to muscular tension which,
when properly focused and released, produced immense physical power.

    Was this a world tensing for its next, and last, exhalation?  A great
release of pressure to cast off the biting pests whose ambitious abuse forever
scarred its face?  Or a whisper, a final turn of the head to slip into death's
repose.  Would the world shrug us off or allow those of us who remained to
slaughter each other for the privilege of scratching out short lives bereft of
dignity on what remained of its carcass  I got the impression it hadn't made up
its mind.

   The still frame that haunts my haggard days, though, is the doll.  A child's
doll, striped naked, filthy and stained on one side, its plastic face molded
into an infant's expression of unconditional trust and love for a parent.
Somewhere in the history of this world, a child loved this doll and believed it
loved her back.  Somewhere in the history of this world, this doll was
extremely important to a little girl who had nothing to do with the end of
world.

   I stopped Allan, and picked up the doll, and looked at it.  Somewhere in the
past, in one of these blackened cars stripped bare, a little girl hugged this
doll under a bright sun in a blue sky and closed her eyes and was happy to be
alive, happy to do no more than draw another breath and be comforted by an
inanimate object that she irrationally loved.

   And now here it is, in my cut and calloused hand, discarded.  Thrown aside,
its clothing salvaged -- to staunch a wound or kindle a fire.  I wept.  It was
unavoidable.  I could think only of my own children, and that they were dead,
and that all I would ever hope for is that they died quickly and without
suffering.  I could only hope that their terror was brief, that their mother
was brave as she held them close, huddled in a corner, waiting to die within
the next minute, hearing or feeling the rumble of an approaching terminus.  I
could only hope that she mustered words that reassured them that they had been
cherished.

   I could only hope that, before they all died, my wife thought to tell them I
loved them.  I could only hope that I had made their brief journey through this
world joyous enough to offset those last few seconds of abject terror.  I could
only hope that my wife was able to comfort them with a distraction -- a memory
of a happy time.  I hoped that I was part of that memory, and that the last
thing they did before they were incinerated was to smile at the thought of
their Daddy, who was away on business and, like so many other important
moments of their lives, unavailable to be there in person.

   And I knew I would live my days out with this being all that passed for
hope.

   What dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp?

   "Bill?"  Allan was looking at me.  The doll was blurry through my tears.
   The world was blurry through the haze.

   I couldn't speak.  Allan shifted, impatiently, instinctively looking around
for threats.  We'd been standing still too long.

   I whispered a prayer I knew nobody heard.  Another superstition.

   "Your Daddy loved you," I said to the doll, and placed it carefully back
where I had found it.  Just in case the little girl came looking for it some
day.

   When the stars threw down their spears
   And water'd heaven with their tears
   Did He smile His work to see?
   Did He who made the lamb make thee?

   Tiger, tiger, burning bright
   In the forests of the night
   What immortal hand or eye

   Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

I have not done any writing since school 20+ years ago. I have a couple of
ideas, but I have never had any training at writing a novel. school did not
offer it. I know there is more to just putting it on paper.
What I would like to know, is there any place online that can act as a mentor?
It would have to be something that would help protect an idea from being
stolen.
I have no idea if there is such a place where you could submit something, and
you get fair input on structure. Not so much of "Your idea sucks" but things
like, you might want more detail on this, or what if you moved this part before
this? Things like that.

Long post here, sorry.  But I've got a lot on this one :)

To some extent, there's not really any such thing as an idea being stolen.
Ideas are pretty universal to a degree - just look at how many books there are
in B&N's fantasy section that are basically "person with fey connections
becomes a reluctant paranormal sleuth to solve crime/ track down killer preying
on the local faerie underground community," or some subset thereof.  Likewise
in mystery, or in literary fiction, etc., you'll find that same sort of thing.
About 90% of all teen books right now, it seems, are paranormal fantasy/
romance.  That said... that's only to some extent, but even to the degree ideas
are stolen, because of the natural overlap, it's hard to prove outside of
direct plagiarism, and in that case it's pretty easy to prove.  So I wouldn't
worry too much there.

As for the online mentors, etc - you can find online writing teachers, classes,
etc., as well as local workshops and classes, either privately or at a
community college, university extension, online course, or the like.  But the
best practice, really, is just to write.  Find a writing group in your area,
and take things in for critique - this can be tough to do, as there's a lot of
chaff among those and they tend to not last long for the most part (I've been
in three in my time, the longest-lived by far was a year, but shifted in
membership a lot; three of us were a core that lasted the whole time).  But if
it's a good group, it can be incredibly valuable, and get you the sort of
feedback you're after.  Again, local universities might have postings, or a
local writer's league.   Hit NaNoWriMo's pages (www.nanowrimo.org) and look for
the local group for your area - not necessarily to do nano, but because people
in your area that do will likely know about local writing groups, critique
sessions, and the like.  Some of them will be members of those groups, too...
and writers are always looking to help other writers, and bring them into the
community, in my experience.  It's a lonely thing, writing, so we work at
building a sense of community :)

But mostly... just write it, and you'll find yourself practising and building
everything you're looking for as you do.  You have the idea, know roughly where
you want to go... the rest needs to be on paper, and it's trial and error, and
you'll know.  And that's true for everyone.  One friend of mine, a very
successful fantasy and mythology writer, scrapped somewhere around 80-90K words
(mpst of the book) from his last one because he didn't like what he had, didn't
feel he had the pace and depth and structure he was looking for, given where
the series was and where it was headed.  It made the book late, and he was
rushed, but he did a near-complete rewrite for those reasons - and he's got
over 100 book credits to his name, spanning three decades.  So... just write
the thing; what you're looking for will come as you do.

Writer's League. That is something I have forgotten about. My school talked of
them, but I think it was basically because my teachers did not want to teach
about it, or could not etc.
I do remember being elected by my 7th grade class to attend a young writers
conference. It was an OK experience, but it did nothing to improve your
writing, but instead, it had workshops like writing a story from a picture, and
while it did have vocabulary workshops, there was nothing about research,
structure etc etc.

Well, I don't think there's a magic "Here's good structure" trick.

Writers get better by doing two things:
1) Reading
20 Writing

So workshops with prompts and things like that are really the best way _to_
learn.

So if you want to write a novel with good structure, read (or reread) a bunch
of novels you feel are well-structured and plotted.  Try to see what works.
Steal readily.

What the heck, I will post something I just wrote. Not a true story. Nothing I
want to happen. My mind is constantly going over scenarios of what if. What if
someone did this to me, how I might react. I do this because I would fly off
the handle, and now that I know it, I can control myself. I do have a rage
problem, and it came to a head when I pulled a kid from his car through the
window one time for wronging me.


I arrived home from work before my wife, so I would be the one letting our dog
out of his kennel, and taking him outside. He is a smaller dog, about 20
pounds. He is part terrier, and part chihuahua, from what we were told at the
animal shelter.
Dexter is the most trying dog I have ever had, but no other dog has made me
laugh like him. He will go into biting fits, but those are diminishing as he
gets older. The silly things are still there.
I walk in the house, and there he is lying in his kennel. He looks so
complacent, like a calm little guy. As I walk to let him out, he stands up, and
begins his stretching routine. I open his kennel door, and as normal, his front
legs come out, and he stretches, then his back legs come out, and he stretches
some more. All the while, I am rubbing his sides and back. This moment is what
I call .Stretches and Scratches.. Now that he is loosened up, the mayhem can
begin.
He starts by jumping at me, and I start asking him if he needs to go outside.
He jumps down, and starts running around the main level of the house. I decide
that instead of just letting him out to our back yard, I would take him for a
short walk. I grab his harness and leash, and he knows exactly what is going
on. He really likes it when it is time to put the harness on, but he never
makes it easy. It seems as if he hates wearing it, but loves the reason to have
it on.
I finally get it on him, and with the final click, he is on the floor, rubbing
his sides on the carpet. I pick up the leash, and walk to the door. He gets the
hint, and is right beside me. I fasten him up, and out the door we go.
He typically stops at the car, wanting to go for a ride, but I nudge him to the
sidewalk. It takes a couple of houses of him sniffing at every thing he sees
before we can walk in earnest. Our normal short walk is a figure eight in our
neighborhood. Down our street, up the next, down the next, then work our way
back.
Our neighborhood used to be very nice, but with the housing boom, it has gone
downhill. A lot of our neighbors sold their houses for a nice profit to move
up, and other people got loans for more than their means, and moved in. Crime
went up, yards were not taken care of, houses started becoming empty as people
left because they could no longer afford it. This is not some exclusive upper
crust community, but very middle class. We were starting to see things come
back to normal, most of the crime element was gone, but there were still some
unruly types. I have had run ins with them in the past. Working in the yard,
coming around the side of the house to some kids (mid teens) in my garage. I
ran them off. Another time, I was coming home from work early, and found a kid
trying to punch in the code for my garage.
Enough history. Dex and I were walking. Normally, the temp would be in the
90.s, but today it was a breezy 80 degrees. We stopped to say hello to other
dog walkers and neighbors. Stopped at a couple fenced yards so Dex could say
hello to the neighborhood dogs. We started crossing the street when I saw a car
coming, and it did not look to be slowing down to stop at the stop sign. I
stopped, and started to pull Dex back to me so that we would not be anywhere
but off the curb, and he could get around us. He was coming from the right, so
there would be plenty of room.
He did manage to stop without locking up the brakes, and I gave him a
disapproving glare. He was just old enough to drive, and had a car load of his
buddies with him.
..Fuck you, old man!. he screamed at me. Old man? I am not even 40.
..You need to slow down a little bit around here. You know there are a lot of
kids that play. I like to drive as fast as anyone I know, but be smart about
it.. I said.
He said something to the person beside him, and replies, .Yeah, your right. Go
ahead. Sorry about that.. and he motions me by.
I start walking Dexter to the other side, but as soon as I was near the car,
and Dexter was in front, he gunned it. His bumper caught the leash, pulling me
with the car. I was mortified to hear the yelp from the front of the car, and
the thump. The force pulled me into the driver.s side of the car, and my arm
whipped out, breaking the glass in the back door. Once it was over, I did not
have to look far to see the result of what he had done. Dexter was now on the
back side of the front wheels, and not moving. I could see a puddle of blood
forming around him. The driver, who was previously laughing at his antics, was
now cursing at a broking window. He looked very angry, and when he opened up
his door, that is when my mind picked which emotion it wanted. I had several to
choose from. There was anguish, heartbreak, horror, anger, fear, sadness... I
saw his door begin to open, I selected rage.
He tried to push his door against me to get out of the car. I shoulder blocked
it shut again, and let drop the leash. I momentarily considered checking on
Dexter, but I knew there was nothing I could do. He was already gone.
..What the fuck!. the kid screamed. Seriously, he just killed my dog for fun,
and nearly ran me down, and he wants to know .What the fuck..
The back door starts to open, and I kick it shut. At that, the driver start
rolling up his window. I let him get it most of the way, and with a punch, I
sent glass flying all over the inside of the car. I glancing punch to the jaw
leaves the kid stunned enough for me to reach in, put the car in park, and pull
out the keys. No point in letting him leave. I wrap my fist around those keys,
and with my other hand, I grab the driver by the hair, and start to pull him
from the car.
I punch him in the center of the back a few times, and slam his face into the
door. The back door starts to open again, and I kick it closed once more. The
driver pulled himself back into the car, and tries to scurry to the other side.
I reach in, and grab him again by the hair. This time, I pull him through the
window face up. Once his face and chest are exposed, I start punching again.
First the nose. He is bleeding profusely when I move to the chest and ribs. The
first punch drives the wind from him, and he sprays me with blood.
I see a door on the other side opening, and in a voice I did not know I had, I
said .Don.t you fucking move!. The command was understood, and they stayed put.
I went back to work, pulling the kid from the car onto the street. I took a
quick look around, and noticed a few people standing around, watching in
horror. My rage had begun to subside, but I still had it in me. I moved my gaze
to the kid on the ground, and my eyes passed the tail of Dexter. That deflated
me. I had enough left to pick the kid up, and throw him over the hood, out of
my way.
I sat down near the car, dropping the keys beside me. As gently as I could, I
pulled Dexter from under the car. The leash was tangled, so I unhooked it. The
tire had hit him right in the middle. I sat with Dexter near me, and I stroked
his back leg. The rage was gone.


This is a just typed version. I just put it down, and spell checked it. I did
not want it to be arty, and the final sentence could sound that way. I just
wanted to write about my rage, not about the sadness I would feel, or the
regret I know I would feel, just the rage. I know I could do more to get that
point across, but when I start getting worked up, my mind starts going faster
than my fingers can keep up with.

There are a couple things that jump out at me, that are likely at least partly
the product of it being quickly typed out, first draft, etc.  Most notably,
verb tense, shifting between present and past; also the passive vs active voice
Those are both classic, and things I look for first off when editing my own
stuff... and also the sort of things a writing group would be great for.

But those are all editing - which is part of writing, yes; it's the 99%
perspiration that goes with the 1% inspiration.  More significant though is
what you said at the end: when you get going, your fingers aren't fast enough
for your thinking.  That's what you need - it's how a story grows (and often
takes us by surprise as writers).  The editing, etc are what makes it better
writing, and us better writers as we learn and those things become second
nature.  But without the writing to work with, there's nothing to make better
and learn from.

So again... go write :)

I revised this.  Comments welcome.


   We spent four days on the road as fugitives of a sort, four days that passed
in a blur I don't remember except for things like the doll.  There were other
images.  We fled down highway sixty-three, remained of it.  Our conversation
was non-verbal, shared experiences.  Mute observations we later wished we
hadn't made.  Dark stains on the pavement that we knew were blood, oddly
symmetric, like a Rorshach pattern burned into the road.

    What immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?

    Allan insisted on checking every car for food.  I insisted on the safety of
ditches and thickets.  But every bullet that could be fired had been fired, and
distance was our defenses, not ditches of thatch.  The world was filthy, weeds
overgrown through cracks, now dead, brown and bent.

    The world's was still and tense.  The wind didn't blow.  No planes flew, no
birds sang, no crickets chirped.  It was a world holding its breath in
anticipation, but of what?

    I stepped over what looked like part of an incinerated golf bag but could
have as easily been a torso.  My ankles were raw from the leg irons.  I
couldn't feel my feet.  We stepped over downed power lines, black cables
snaking across the road.  Our instinct to avoid contact surivived the
cataclysm, now merey a superstition.

   But you avoid potential injury when there's no more hospitals or doctors.
Die fast if you must die.  We walk past a spread of bullet casings and cars wth
pocked skin and empty windowframes like the eye sockets of a skull.

   Did He who made the lamb make thee?

   Clouds were shades of gray in a gray sky.  I would have welcomed the sound
of thunder.  Stillness and silence.  The deep breath.  Was the world tensing
for a final exhalation?  A great release of pressure that would cast off the
unwelcome interlopers whose ambitions had scarred its face?  Or would the world
slip into eternal motionless, death's repose?  And those who remained could
slaughter each other for the privilege of scratching out short lives bereft of
humanity on its carcass?

   The still frame that haunts my haggard days, though, is the doll.  A child's
doll, striped naked, filthy and stained on one side, its plastic face molded
into an infant's unconditional trust and love for a parent.  Somewhere in the
history of this world, a child loved this doll and believed it loved her back.
Somewhere in the history of this world, this doll was extremely important to a
little girl who had nothing to do with the end of world.

   I stopped Allan, and picked up the doll, and looked at it.  Somewhere in the
past, in one of these blackened cars stripped bare, a little girl hugged this
doll under a bright sun in a blue sky and closed her eyes and was happy to be
alive, happy to do no more than draw another breath and be comforted by an
inanimate object that she irrationally loved.

   And now here it is, in my cut and calloused hand, discarded.  Thrown aside,
its clothing salvaged -- to staunch a wound or kindle a fire.  I wept.  I could
think only of my own children, and that they were dead, and that all I would
ever hope for is that they died quickly and without suffering.  I could only
hope that their terror was brief, that their mother was brave as she held them
close, huddled in a corner, waiting to die, hearing or feeling the approaching
fire.

   I could only hope that she mustered words that reassured them that they had
been loved.

   I could only hope that, my told them I loved them.  I could only hope that I
had made their brief journey through this world joyous enough to offset those
last few seconds of abject terror.  I could only hope that my wife was able to
comfort them with a distraction -- a memory of a happy time.  I hoped that I
was part of that memory, and that the last thing they did before they were
incinerated was to smile at the thought of their father, then away on business
and, like so many other important moments of their lives, unavailable when it
mattered.

   This was what passed for hope.

   "Bill?"  Allan looked at me.
   The world was a blurry haze.

   Allan shifted, impatiently, instinctively looking around for threats.  We'd
been standing still too long.  I whispered a prayer nobody heard.

   "Your Daddy loved you," I said to the doll, and placed it carefully back
where I had found it.  Just in case the little girl came looking for it some
day, and followed Allan.

   When the stars threw down their spears
   And water'd heaven with their tears
   Did He smile His work to see?
   Did He who made the lamb make thee?

   Tiger, tiger, burning bright
   In the forests of the night
   What immortal hand or eye

   Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

That's how it'd be if the headline were written by the quote-happy folks

always find myself wondering whether the quotes mean it didn't really

"Man Killed When Car Runs Over Him" is, to me, tortuous but not
incomprehensible.  Do you use the phrase 'run over' in American English?  As
in, "he was run over" to describe a car accident?  It's common usage in the UK.

Granted the journalist needs a lesson in not -always- writing the way you'd
speak ("Man killed in car accident" would have been far better phrasing) but
the meaning isn't in doubt.

Shag: I really don't think I've ever seen a headline QUITE like the one you
describe on the BBC although I do know what you mean... 'killed' is pretty
absolute.  You can't be a bit killed.  Slightly killed.  Mostly killed.  You
are either dead or not.  They tend to report that in a pretty black and white
manner.

Quotes are usually used (I accept, overused) when they are actually quoting a
person and there is the tiniest doubt that they might be expressing opinion
rather than absolute fact.  As in, to pick a half a dozen random examples from
the site right now...

Cattle 'cloned from dead animals'
Haiti quake caused by 'new fault'
A million 'take out payday loans'
Childhood stress 'causes illness'
Pupil A-level advice 'inadequate'
Obese 'see GP more than smokers'

You're right, it's in 'almost every headline' ;-)

is struggling with psychological issues that are slowly consuming him to the
point where  he is breaking down and slowing the other guy down.  The other guy
is obsessed with survival and has become totally amoral.  The narrator
decides surviving is pointless if it means shedding your humanity.  The poem is
supposed to be about the lamb vs the tiger and the narrator's struggle with
abandoning his humanity to survive.  "Did he who made the lamb make thee?"  God
gave us these animal instincts to survive and yet the cognition to develop
morality.  If you can't have both, do you need either?  That's sort of where
I'm going with it and this is just the first piece I wrote, it's basically the
moral/thematic climax of the story.  The guy remembers his family and children
and is torn to psychological shambles and thats when he realizes he cant just
live for the sake of living, thats what animals do.  Obviously some kind of
confrontation with the other guy is inevitable and thats probably the narrative
climax.  I'm still playing around with it.

The sentence has another problem, actually.  You generally want to keep the
subject as close to the verb as possible.  When you nominalize too much into
the subject, you sacrifice clarity.  In this sentence, there's several phrases
and a whole *clause* separating the subject from the verb.

Without the full context, I couldn't offer specific revision advice.  But it
might need to be broken up, if clarity is your goal.

OK, here's a country song I penned this morning... figured I'd get some
feedback.

<verse 1>
Growin up
So long ago
Had a stand of pines
Where grass won't grow
And an old toy truck

Brothers, friends,
And neighbors came
To our little world
Just to stake a claim
To a patch of dirt

<chorus>
Somehow we managed
To get by
We solved disputes
Without much fight
We were more mature
Than we ever knew

There were common goals
We all worked for
Helped each other out
No keepin' score
Didn't seem so hard
In our back yard
In that old dirt pile

<verse 2>
Made some roads
And packed them down
Built farms and homes
Like a little town
But run by kids

Everybody
Played a part
We all took
Our work to heart
For the common good

<chorus>
Somehow we managed
To get by
We solved disputes
Without much fight
We were more mature
Than we ever knew

There were common goals
We all worked toward
Helped each other out
No keepin' score
Didn't seem so hard
In our back yard
In that old dirt pile

<verse 3>
Don't know when
It got so hard
To open up
Let down our guard
Find a compromise

Seems this world
Of grown up men
Doesn't have the sense
We had back then
To just get along

<chorus>
Somehow we managed
To get by
We solved disputes
Without much fight
We were more mature
Than we ever knew

There were common goals
We all worked toward
Helped each other out
No keepin' score
Didn't seem so hard
In our back yard
In that old dirt pile

Introductory sentence to a classmate's paper.  I can't quite put my finger on
what's so horribly wrong with it, but it just needs to be taken out and shot.

"Similar to the process of natural selection whereby certain ecological species
genetically adapt to environmental changes and survive those species that
remain stagnant, the law must also adapt to keep up with societal changes."

The subject is so far away from the beginning of the sentence that it's two and
a half lines of confusion and frustration before we even know what he's talking
about.  It would be easy to fix: you'd have to move the first clause to the
end.

Of course, that doesn't address the apparent urge to sound smart at the cost of
saying something.  What the hell is an "ecological species?"  Are there lots of
species that aren't ecological?  And "survive" here as a transitive is an
unusual and marked usage that misleads the reader.  Moreover, this writer has
no idea how evolution works.

That opening sentence's first problem is grammar.  Drop the explanation of
natural selection and it still sounds weird because the comparison is between a
noun phrase, "the process of natural selection", and an imperative verb phrase,
"the law must adapt".  Perhaps:

"Just as nature evolves through the process of natural selection, the law must
evolve to reflect societal changes.  Similar to the way genetic traits are lost
because they do not aid in survival, some statutes should fall off the books as
they fail to aid the judicial process."

Unless of course, the subject of the paper is that law should reflect the
popular culture and not be a constant, in which case the entire comparison is
off-base.

I am starting a long-term writing project and was wondering what programs
people currently use to help them organize and write.

My writing always revolve around some kind of enduring character, plot, or
theme that goes well with rather well-fleshed out character histories. So, a
character in a book would have sufficient backstory that would lend to a book
or series of short stories in its own right.

If you don't currently use anything other than a text editor, don't bother
googling one for me. I just wanted to see what features/apps are important to
current writers.

Also, if you use any program to assist in writing poems, this would be of
interest. I always wanted a verse analyzer to tell me of my poem was truly
pentameter... etc. Also, some poetry creation devices are so useful for
providing the kernel/shell of a poem it would be nice to have these enumerated
as a wizard or template of sort.

Anyways, so any application used to assist in writing poems, stories, or even
any other kind of writing.. tia

I use yWriter for my fiction. At its heart, it's a basic text editor, but Simon
has given it some features that are really useful for me as a writer (and a few
features I don't use much right now but may use at some point).

If you outline before you write, yWriter can help you do that. It's got
drag-and-drop for reorganizing scenes within chapters. (It also works for
moving a scene from one chapter to another.) There are character, location, and
item databases. You can set time and duration for scenes and include notes
separately from the text of the story itself. You can set some deadlines, and
generate a report that will show which scenes you need to write or edit each
day in order to meet your deadlines. You can put in a goal word count and a
deadline, and the program will tell you how many words you need to write each
day. When you're finished your draft (whichever one you're on), you can export
to .rtf so you can format the document in OO or Word or whatever program you
prefer for word processing, and then share it with people for C&C. You can
print scene cards (summaries of each scene) if you prefer doing your
reorganization in 3D. It will generate a timeline. You can have a report that
shows which characters/locations/items are in which scenes.

Those are the things that I use the most. I don't use the items database very
much, because I don't write mysteries or high fantasy (the two genres that
mostly need you to keep track of items). Some people use the items database to
keep track of things like multiple subplots - it's up to you what you use and
don't use, and how. (Also, you can export to other file formats than .rtf, I
just don't use those ones.)

Also, there's a Google Group for it, and Simon is on it. People make
suggestions for improvements, and sometimes Simon agrees that they've had a
good idea, and he adds it. Sometimes poeple ask for things that yWriter isn't
meant for. If you're having trouble getting the program to do something the way
you want it to, or if you find a bug, you can post it to the list and someone
will help you figure it out.

And it's completely free. (Simon's written a couple of other neat programs for
writers, including one called Sonar, which is for tracking submissions. They're
all free.)

awaiting the release of the Windows version (due later this year); from what
I've seen, it's similar to the more recent versions of yWriter, with more to
offer than yWriter had to begin with - though I'm getting the idea the two are
closer now.
Anyway, Scrivener is at www.literatureandlatte.com

I am a counselor and am beginning a writing group for some high school girls.
In my mind I've titled it "Healing through Writing." It's based on a spiritual
writing course I took in seminary. I have some good ideas for activities, and
I'm wondering if others know of good activities that involve writing that could
be used with teenagers. We'll be meeting once a week for an hour. I'm planning
on giving them optional writing assignments outside of class. They won't be
required to complete these because I'm not grading anything. If you have any
ideas, I'd love to hear them.

Question:

I find myself writing in a strange way these days. I'm sure I'm not the first
person to write this way, I'm just curious if anyone else writes this way or if
anyone knows of a novelist or other writer who writes this way.

I have, in my mind, a lengthy novel length story, but its only a sketch. A
framework. As I go through my day, my mind will latch onto a random point and
I'll think my way through it, then I'll commit that to writing. What this means
is its like I'm writing part of chapter 27 one day, part of chapter 15 the
next, never have I written chapter 1. I'm writing in fragments of a greater
story and, i'm supposing, eventually these fragments will fit together.

Generally, I've been a linear writer. Start at the beginning and work my way
through. Occasionally, I would sketch a part of the story out of order, to get
a random thought on paper before it faded, but I've never written completely
out of order. Its like putting together a jigsaw puzzle.

So, does anyone else write this way? Any comments? Is this strange or is it
common? Any hints on how to fit it together at the end?

It's not at all uncommon.  Sometimes, we see parts of things despite not seeing
the bits between.  In fact, at a workshop I attended once, one of the
presenters (a YA writer) cited C. S. Lewis about writing, saying that writing a
novel was like standing on one edge of a valley, and seeing the other side, but
in between was shrouded in mist.  Here and there, he could see a boulder or a
tree popping up, but most of what was between was hidden.  So what he would do
was head for the first tree.  In this case, you're just somewhere in the mist
and being transported back and forth.  Is it a fantasy novel? :)

As for putting it together, there are a number of software programs that might
help.  Look for something that lets you shuffle and organize scenes, something
with a corkboard or bulletin board perhaps.  One I hear talked about a lot is
ywriter; another, which I like the look of a lot, is Scrivener.  Scriv is
mac-only at this point, but there's a Windows version in development, with a
beta, and the full version is tentatively due in July.  Look around; there'll
be others as well.
ywriter is here: http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter.html
and I think on cnet as well.  For Scrivener:
www.literatureandlatte.com
and for the ScrivWin beta:
http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivenerforwindows/

There's a free trial of the Mac Scrivener, and ywriter is completely free, as
is the Win beta.  Scrivener's site also (somewhere) has a listing of other
programs and links to them, so you might be able to start research there if
you're interested.

This is for any amateur writers or aspiring writers, especially.

NaNoWriMo might seem like pushing quantity over quality, but the truth of the
matter is that most writers just need more practice writing. Just being able to
get used to putting your thoughts down on paper (to the tune of 50k words) is
great practice. If you could imagine writing even a have cohesive story with
all the elements that entails, that is likely to push your writing skills
beyond what you could have imagined.

Here is another link for people who might think NaNoWriMo wouldn't help them or
is a waste.

Having taken writing classes at the U of Iowa, where O'Connor got her writing
education, she's spot on.  This is how our classes went:

  Assignment:  Write a non-genre short story.

  Results:

    The girl wearing the flower dress with long straight hair she hasn't
    washed in six weeks wrote a story about being a hippie in college.

    The fat kid who wanted to be a comic book writer wrote a story about
    a chubby kid who wanted to be a comic book writer and everybody made
    fun of him for it, then at the end, Superman showed up.

    The flannel-wearing skateboarder wrote a story about a kid who was
    into grunge and skateboarding and got made fun of for not being into
    mainstream music.

    The horn-rimmed eyeglasses wearing frumpy feminist wrote a story about
    a man treating a strong, intelligent woman poorly and cheating on her
    with a pretty, but stupid, friend of hers.

    The middle-aged Russian immigrant wrote a story about a Russian
    immigrant who brought a girl with a German last name home to meet
    his mother, and she freaked out even though the girl wasn't German.

    The chubby lesbian with the crew cut and no bra wrote a story about
    a girl who discovered she was a lesbian.

    And on and on.

    To his infinite credit, the token homosexual wrote a story about a
    an imprisoned drug dealer who got out of jail, fell in with a
    Mexican drug cartel, started fucking the boss's wife, and went on the
    run.

    So when I wrote a story about a guy who (probably) raped a woman, I was
    pretty sure the class would conclude I was some kind of rapist or
    something, but during the round table, the professor said:

    "Did anybody actually like the main character in this story?"

    The lesbian raised her hand and said, "I did.  He was funny.  I'd hang
    out with him socially."

    The horn-rimmed glasses girl, in her slow, self-important drawl, said,
    "I'm fatigued of all the men in this class writing stories about violence
     against women, but I guess we all just write what we know the most about."

    My story didn't actually have a single line describing or admitting to
    the rape, until the very last line, which was:

    "I welcomed her in the overgrown parking lot of an abandoned gas station."

    The rest of it was building up the main character as a sociopath
    who was obsessed with sex, both conditions stemming from an abusive
    father who took delight in embarassing his kids, for the purpose of
    suggesting a sexual assault as the meaning of this sentence.

I ought to dig it up and poot it actually, I got an "A" on it.  I bet
it'd seem embarassingly shadllow to me now, 15 years later.

I'm not sure I see the problem with "writing what you know" when given an
assignment to write a non-genre shortstory. Many authors (and teachers) would
tell you that you SHOULD write what you know, that you'll be able to write with
a texture and depth you can't write with if you write "what you don't know"

That being said, I never write "what I know" because it doesn't interest me.
Which is kind of a sad self-statement I suppose. And I consider myself a genre
writer.

Maybe "shallow college short stories" should be its own genre? hee.

Curiously, the last non-genre story I wrote... well, the last one I
completed... was also about sexual assault in a way, though more realistically
it was about the notion of personal space and how it's flexible in different
contexts.

A friend of mine (about as good a writer as I am, no worse and no better)
called me out on it, noting that my protagonist had to have such a precise set
of attributes to make the plot work out that she seemed too unrealistic to
identify with.

Back to the drawing board.

Steppenwolf: I read the 'personal space' one, and I not only found it
intriguing, it reminded me of something Id read in college, but I never did
fully place it. I took a short story class in princeton at the community
college for the heck of it, and Im sure it was in that anthology we used.
(Which I no longer own, darnit.) I wish I did, as I love short stories.

Write what you know: I look at this the other way, too. I can learn something
until I know it well enough to write about it.

I'm learning from many writers right now, devices and methods of storytelling,
but also thrusting myself into crime, crime-scene investigation, autopsies...
the whole shebang. It started in my real life, when I was a medical
transcriptionist and found that I found autopsies fascinating. They tell you so
much. And, I like reading obituaries as ways to find the shortest way to
describe a character, for descriptions and illustrations of life.

And then I stumbled into cable tv, and found "Criminal Minds" and have watched
all but 6 episodes of the first 5 seasons. (Who knew you could map dump sites
and come up with a geographic profile?) I found the FBI evidence manual online
for free. I did watch some CSI shows, but couldnt maintain my interest beyond
learning about various crime-related databases. Sometimes the CSI tv shows'
characterizations seemed too shallow. Usually sweeps week sucked, realism gone.

Then, Lo and behold, a serial killer was found here in Cleveland. The local
journalism was instructive -- some of it was insightful, some of it boring.
The victims pictures paraded in the media often, the killer had a type, and it
turns out, a few would be victims had escaped. The trial was anticlimactic.
That initial shock of -- a serial killer -- a few corners away from my old
address -- wore off, but the clarity of the feeling stays with me.

Turns out, I am beginning to know enough to write what I know!

Write what you know: I think that you have to take that with a grain of salt,
really. The main thing I focus on in my writing is that I know what it is to be
a human being. Everything else can be learned.

So I have a series of YA novels in progress. Each book has a different main
character, and each main character has a different disability. So far, I have
an autistic 14yo girl; an undiagnosed 16yo girl; a 17yo boy who has ADHD; a
13yo boy who has cerebral palsy; a 16yo girl who has Down syndrome; and a 17yo
boy who has some kind of cognitive disability. My qualifications? Well, I used
to be a teenage girl. And I have ADHD. Oh, and I worked with autistic kids for
10 years. The rest I can learn from friends who have the disorders and from
books about the disorders.

Other things I have to deal with in these books include: the 14yo autistic girl
is a gymnast, and I haven't taken gymnastics since I was 11yo; the 16yo girl
who has no diagnosis is a ballet dancer, and I haven't taken ballet since I was
14yo (and I was never as good as she is); the 17yo ADHDer is an artist, and
while I dabble, I don't have the experience he does; the 13yo boy who has
cerebral palsy is gay; the 16yo girl who has Down syndrome is a tad obsessive
and stalker-y; and the 17yo with the cognitive disability is transitioning into
adult services, which is a field I've never even worked in.

But that's all stuff I can learn about.

What's weird is that none of them are musicians. And I used to be.

Jubilee: I agree with you! In classical literature, Terence says: "Nothing
human is foreign to me" And then we have Montaigne, Oscar Wilde and so many
more who agree. Add that to Alfred Lord Tennyson's poem Ulysees: "I am a part
of all that I have met"

Being human, being open to human experience, qualifies us for a lot. We can, as
humans, learn from others' mistakes, and imagine others' experiences-- even if
they only happen in books, or if they happen online, on the news, or next door.

(UNRELATED)

Perhaps I should apologize for putting this next!
This last 2 weeks I've been on vacation, and I have jumped headlong into "chick
lit," with loads of beachy novels, mostly by the authors Claire Cook (Movie:
Must Love Dogs) and Jennifer Weiner (Movie: In Her Shoes)

My college profs all wanted me to write the Next Great American Novel (TM)
and it strikes me that if I aim for fun instead, I might just be able to do it.
I can always go for the "N.G.A.N." Later. :)

In college I had seemingly inifinite horrid episodes of writers block, and then
right before the deadline, I'd choke back tears and a sense that I had nothing
to say, to write the paper anyway, however unworthy it was, because anything
was better than a zero in the gradebook! But I am NOT one who does her best
work under pressure.

So, rather than force myself to write by anxiety, I'm trying to motivate myself
with fun. I don't want to lower my expectations, but I want to make them a bit
more accessible to begin with.

And, Jennifer Weiner is a Princeton graduate. She even wrote a pretty decent
mystery in one of her books-- that appealed to me a lot! So, hey, Im willing to
consider writing in a different genre. I know where I want to go, but I can
stop along the way in any number of other places!

I think this is why Im reading all over the spectrum now -- finding devices,
character elements, all kinds of observations while I read.

One thing I've found helpful in writing is to spend more time talking to
editors.  A good editor really understands the rhetorical framing of a scene,
the center action, the falling action, etc.  I find that the old movie cliche,
"Get in late, get out early" often applies to writing, particularly if you want
to create a sense of urgency and tension in your writing.

When I sit down to write, I have in my head the pieces of dialog I want on the
page, and I start writing and I keep backing up and backing up to get to an
earlier point to present the reader with all of this information.  But reading
an entire conversation is tedious, and boring.  Conversations are like dreams;
if you're having a good one, you suddenly find yourself an hour into it with no
memory of how you got there.

Doing editing work, and talking to editors, I find is helpful to focus on what
it takes to make a chapter work, and to foster character development and to
advance the action of the story.  There's one basic question I try to ask
before I write a scene: what is this scene about?  And I try to step away from
what I want the characters to do, and think more about what I want the READER
to want the characters to do and say, and then craft the narrative so that they
are set up to do and say those things, but they don't do it yet, you have to
keep reading.

Always leave them wanting more.

Thoughts?

I found that exposition has to be ladled out very carefully.  Some of
it you can just do with an adjective, but others you need to have one
character fill another character in about something, or someone think
back to just how they got there.  And break it up!

A writing question for y'all.

I have published several of my own books; I get them professionally edited, buy
a block of ISBNs, have the covers professionally made, and then print them.
Recently, I decided to take on a project for a friend; never met the guy, but
he's in the same area of work that I am, and he says he has renal cancer. Don't
know if it's true or not. He's published a book that was printed in German and
French; no American published would take it up, and he wanted to see it printed
in English before he dies. Again- no idea if he's dying or not.

So, being stupid, I offered to do it. I get this book, and it's pretty bad.
It's on a subject that has been done to pieces, and it's not terribly
well-written (English from a guy who is Belgian). Nothing that's going to be a
real page-turner.

None of these issues is a problem; most of that can be fixed. The real problem
is the plagiarism. The first hint was in a chapter near the beginning; one of
the footnotes had hyperlinks in it. I google it up- copied verbatim from
Wikipedia. No attribution. Fuck. I notice the font is different (Web font), and
when I search for that, it's in several footnotes. In fact, I think every
chapter (out of 30-some chapters) has at least one footnote that is copied
at least in part from Wikipedia.

The problem is: he doesn't see anything wrong with this.

I'm ready to kite the whole project, but I was looking for opinions. The guy's
a Belgian professor; he really should know better than to just steal stuff like
this, and I'm kind of split; it *is* minor- just footnotes (as best as I know-
I've tried Googling suspect phrases, and every now and again, it's clear a part
of a paragraph or two is simply mis-worded stuff from a web page). Should I
just toss the whole project in the trash?

I'd say yes.  He's a professor, right?  He ought to know better than to
plagiarize.  If you help him get it published, you might open yourself up to
the same liability if the copyright holders find out and decide to go after
him.

Not to mention if he is really dying, and he dies sooner rather than later, you
might be on the hook by yourself.

Followup on Dr. Dumbass. He nagged me for progress, and I asked him why the
hell he copied so many footnotes. He informed me that information from Wikipedi
was free, etc., and when I didn't reply to that within 24 hours, he went
ballistic and emailed everyone on the project (cover designer, etc.) some
snarky thing that I deleted after skimming.

I think I now know why 3-4 other publishers in the US passed on this book. I

I'm in; in fact, I just logged off the nanowrimo boards :)
I've got three ideas percolating - one is something I tried before, but fell
flat after 5K words. I think I trust myself better now to do it right (a YA
coming of age story, pure lit-fic), but I tend to use nano more to see if an
idea has something, and I know that one does.
So instead, I'm starting with a Steampunk idea.  This spring/ summer, I
answered to a call for submissions for a Steampunk Shakespeare, but I didn;t
use my original idea, because the word count limit was 10K, and I didn't think
that gave me enough room to do what I had in mind.  As it was, what I did came
in at over 14K in first draft, and I had to edit down to 10,100, which was as
slashed as I could get it.  So I'll approach the original idea here, and see
what I get :)  If that doesn;t work out, I have another Steampunk idea (this
one more of an old-style adventure) and the YA litfic.

I've got a great story I want to tell that I think is better suited for film
but I have a better shot at getting a novel version published.

It's based on an incident during the Vietnam war where a major defense
contractor was up for renewal and wanted to convince the DOD that one of their
planes are highly versatile, and they tried to do this by airlifting Vietnamese
orphans out of Vietnam, but something went wrong and the plane crashed, killing
half of them and the rest suffered oxygen deprivation.

I'd re-set that in the context of the Iraq war, but the story I want to tell is
about the legal fight that followed, a government cover-up, and one attorney
who believed in the case and kept chasing and chasing it until he found damning
evidence that was covered up by the government, and he got a new trial based on
that.

And it's a true story, this what happened in the actual case.

This is all I've got for my manowrimo so far.    This is my lawyer book I'm

Anyway,...




  He crossed the small office, frowning, his wrinkled suit looking dingy in the
yellow light reflecting off the wood finish of the shelves and battered chair
rail.  Reaching the small wine cooler, he opened it and pulled out a pint glass
and a bottle of beer.  Standing up, he nudged the cooler with his knee, turned
around, and set the pint glass on the desk.

"Catalina island cherry," he said, gesturing vaguely toward the desk.
The wood finish was well-worn, and it was badly in need of refinishing.  He
opened the top drawer, pulled a bottle opener from it, and popped the top off
the bottle with a practiced motion.  Placing the bottle opener on the desk, he
finally sat down and began to pour the beer.  A black lager, by the look of it.

"Is it really?" asked Louis.

"Yes, indeed," said the old man.  Louis gave the man an appraising
look, and decided that he wasn't nearly as old as he appeared.  "I couldn't
tell you how I know that, it's been so long.  But the wood is Catalina island
cherry."  The old man took a law pull from the pint glass, savored the beer for
a moment, and then swallowed audibly.  "So!" he said, suddenly sitting forward
and looking Louis in the eye.  "Let's start."

"Yes, sir," said Louis.  "To be honest, this is my first one of these,
so I'm not really sure how this works."

"It works like this," said the old man with an envious smile.  He
wishes he was being interviewed, Louis realized.  "When you talk out of here,
another guy who is just as qualified will walk in.  And when that guy leaves,
another guy just as qualified as the both of you will walk in.  I'll talk to
two hundred guys over the next six weeks like that, for less than ten minutes
each, and then I'll decide which of you to hire.  You've got ten minutes to
make me remember who you are when I sit down in two months to pick an
assistant.  Any questions?

"Yes, one," Louis said.  "If this position is hotly sought after and
the qualifications are so high, how do you make a decision on the basis of a
ten minute interview?  Why do I want to work for somebody who only needs ten
minutes to make an important decision?  I spend more time than that choosing
between Cap'n Crunch and Frankenberry in the morning."

  The old man snorted, took another draw from his beer, and then leaned
back and laced his fingers behind his head.  "Well," he said. "The truth is
that you're all interchangeable.  You went to Yale.  The next guy went to
Cornell.  The guy after that went to Chicago.  I guess in the end, I'll hire
the son of a bitch I think will piss me off the least."

"I'm probably off to a bad start then," said Louis, "but I'm afraid I
have to make it worse.  You've got my qualifications wrong, I'm not Ivy
League."

"No?" said the man, expressing what Louis perceived as his first
unreheared emotion of the morning - mild surprise.  He quickly recovered,
however, and put back in place a mask of tedium and disinterest.  "Well, I'll
have to have a chat with my secretary, she seems to have loosened the interview
requirements without asking.  That's one thing I'll remember about you."

"Well, that's sort of my story, Mr. Kent.  I have a knack for being
remembered for the wrong reasons.  When we wrap the case, remind me to tell you
about the fried chicken sandwich incident."

"You're getting ahead of yourself, son.  Fried chicken?"  Louis took
some internal satisfaction in eliciting Kent's second genuine emotion of the
day: confusion.  Again, Kent quickly recovered and took command of the
conversation.  "Got a resume?"

"Of course."  Louis pulled open his briefcase, removed a crisp copy on
white bond paper, and sent it skidding across the desk with a casual flick of
the wrist.  Kent stopped it with his thumb, and picked it up.  Reaching into
his breast pocket, he pulled out a pair of thick abused eyeglasses that, Louis
guessed, were manufactured in the mid-1980s.  Perching the bifocuals on his
nose, Kent looked down through them at the paper, his mouth forming a slight
"O" as he read.

"Pen?" Kent asked, his open hand held out before Louis without looking
up.  Louis silently reached into his own breast pocket and slapped the pen into
Kent's palm."

"Israeli olive wood," Louis said, "harvested from naturally felled
trees near Calvary Hill."  Kent looked up from the resume at the wooden pen
Louis had placed in his palm, and then at Louis with a curious lift of the
eyebrow.  "Hand-turned," Louis clarified.  "The blood of Jesus Christ could be
within your hand."  Kent opened the pen and returned his gaze the paper, making
notes on the resume.

"If you think," Kent said without looking up, "that you'll get a job
here by simply being obnoxious, you're mistaken."

"With all due respect, Mr. Kent, I went to law school with your last
associate and the only two things he had a talent for were impregnating
secretaries and being obnoxious.  It's my understanding he put both skills to
good use while in your employ.  That's probably why your secretary is
unfamiliar with your interview requirements: she's a temp for your usual
secretary, who should be out on maternity leave about now."

Kent looked up with his third unrehearsed emotion of the day, but Louis
couldn't read it.  Not anger, surprise, or annoyance.  Nor interest.  Just
casual regard.  "You are strangely well-informed for a boy with a public school
education, Mr. Durrant."

"Right place, right time," Louis replied easily.  "I think my ten
minutes is nearly up."

"I do have one question for you before you go."

"Yes, sir, I'll take a crack at it."

"What is your greatest personal strength?"

"Easy," said Louis.  "Lack of confidence."

"I said, 'strength,' Mr. Durrant."

"I heard you," said Louis.  "The answer is my lack of confidence."

I've got a playlist of songs I listen to when I'm writing intense drama, for

I think the problem there is that the author wanted to use the cliche, realized

Premise:

  Person A says:  "I broke into the garage because it was storming and I
                   needed shelter."

  Person B says:  "Person A admits that he broke into the garage."

I want to write something like this:

  "Person B's assertion flatly ignores Person A's unambiguous statement that
the reason he broke into the garage was to seek shelter."

  The word I don't like is "flatly."  I see it used all the time, but I don't
like it.  The connotation I want to convey is that the person is deliberately
and intentionally ignoring that statement because if they have to or their
point doesn't work.

  Imagine a person deliberately turning a blind eye to a patently obvious
observation.... I need a short, crisp adverb to convey that and I'm not coming
up with anything.

This is a revision of a short story I was working on last year.  Very short.
It's inspired by Cormac McCarthys' "The Road" and the poem Tiger Tiger by
William Blake.

The purpose is to evoke the guilt and hopelessness of an absentee parent in
stark fashion.  I'm not settled on a title.






We spent four days on the road together, fugitives of a sort.  Those four days
passed in a blur I don't remember, except for images of things like the doll.
We fled down highway sixty-three, or what remained of it, and our conversation
was non-verbal, mostly exchanged looks which shared all there was to share when
we came upon another dark stain on the pavement, a Rorshach pattern burned into
the road, and another entry in a growing catalog of observations wed have
rather not made.

    What immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?

    Allan insisted on checking every car for food and I insisted on the safety
of ditches and thickets.  But I knew my fears were born of paranoia and not
pragmatism.  Every bullet that could be fired had already been fired.  Our best
defense was vision and distance, not cover.  The world was filthy, with weeds
overgrown through cracks, now dead, brown, bent, and still.  The wind didnt
blow, no planes flew, no birds sang, and no crickets chirped at dusk, there
were not even any mosquitoes to swat.  We walked in a world holding its breath,
but in anticipation of what?  Perhaps only to savor what remained, as the next
exhalation would be its last.

    I stepped over what looked like an incinerated golf bag but could have as
easily been a torso.  My ankles were raw from the leg irons, which grew hot in
the afternoons and burned the tops of my feet.  But, I couldn't feel my feet,
so it didnt matter.  Nothing got infected.  We stepped over downed power lines
laying like dead snakes across the road.  Our instinct to avoid contact with
them survived the cataclysm, transformed in the ashen dusk from caution to
superstition.  You avoid even minor injury when there's no hospitals or
doctors, and no antibiotics or pain killers.

If you must die, die fast.

    We walk past a spread of casings next to windowless and torched cars wth
pockmarked doors, the empty headlights like the eye sockets of a charred skull.

   Did He who made the lamb make thee?

The clouds were shadows of gray upon a gray sky.  I would have welcomed the
sound of thunder, but the world was a study in stillness and silence.  The deep
breath, tensing for a final great release of pressure that would at last shed
the remaining few unwelcome interlopers whose ambitions had left these scars
before the world slipped into perpetual motionlessness.  And we who remained
could slaughter each other upon the carcass, for the privilege of bearing
witness to that final twitch before the world froze in the last repose of a
thing dying.

These images give no comfort, but my nights are haunted by the doll.  A child's
doll, striped naked, with dead bits of leaf stuck in the yarned head, filthy
and stained on one side, its plastic face molded into an infant's expression
unconditional love, that the person to whom God entrusted this most helpless
creature would always be there, would always provide food, shelter, warmth, and
comfort.  Somewhere in the history of this world, a child loved this doll and
believed it loved her back, and projected the childs own affection and love
for a parent unto this doll.  Somewhere in the history of this world, this doll
was extremely important to a little girl who had nothing to do with the end of
world.

   I stopped Allan, and picked up the doll, and looked at it.  Somewhere in the
past, in one of these blackened cars stripped bare, a little girl hugged this
doll under a bright sun in a blue sky and closed her eyes and was happy to be
alive, happy to do no more than draw another breath and be comforted by an
inanimate object.

   When the stars threw down their spears

   And now here it is, in my cut and calloused hand, discarded.  Thrown aside,
its clothing salvaged -- to staunch a wound or kindle a fire.  I wept.  I could
think only of my own children, and that they were dead, and that all I would
ever hope for is that they died quickly and without suffering.  I could only
hope that their terror was brief, that their mother was brave as she held them
close, huddled in a corner, hearing the approaching fire, and waiting for them
all to die.

   I could only hope that she was able, in those final moments, to assure them
that they had been loved.

   And water'd heaven with their tears

   I could only hope that my wife remembered to tell them I loved them.  I
could only hope that I had filled their short lives with enough joyous moments
that my wife deflected the horror of the moment with a story about the time
Daddy did something funny.  Anything to cut through those last few seconds of
abject terror.  I could only hope that my wife was able to comfort them with a
distraction -- a memory of a happy time.  I hoped that I was part of that
memory, and that the last thing they did before they were incinerated was to
smile at the thought of a father, even though he was once again be absent from
their lives when they needed him.

   This was what passed for hope.

   Did He smile His work to see?

   "Bill?"  Allan looked at me. The world was blurry. Allan shifted,
impatiently, scanning constantly for threats.  We'd been standing still too
long. I whispered a prayer nobody heard.

   Did He who made the lamb make thee?

   "Your Daddy loved you," I said to the doll, and placed it carefully back
where I had found it, just in case the little girl came looking for it some
day.  We moved on.

   Tiger, tiger, burning bright
   In the forests of the night
   What immortal hand or eye
   Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?

Sewing Machines>  I have five.  Yes, you read that correctly.  I had 8 and I
freecycled three of them.  I took all the attachments and gave away the
machines.  It's amazing what people will take for free.  Anyway...

My very first machine was a Husqvarna Viking.  A very nice machine that was a
gift from my ex.  It does a lot of wonderful stitches, has great attachments
and is a free arm.  I use that one the most.

The one I use second most is my 1938 Pre-War Singer Featherweight.  Lil B, I
call her.  She was 100% complete when I bought her.  She works like a champ. 
She only does straight stitches but they are perfect.  It was a complete mess
when I got her thought.  Her tension was off and she was flithy, the belt
slipped.  But, I bought her for a song and love her fantastically.  I bought
another 1950 Singer featherweight off Craigslist for an embarassingly LOW LOW
price.  All I got was the machine though.  I have pieced together an original
case, manual, bobbin case and power supply.  I have finished cleaning her up
and will give her a through tuning.  I want to use her for about a month, as
well, so I can make sure it works as well as Lil B and then I will put her up
on Ebay.  I have no attachements for her but, I am still trying to find some. 
It does have the original multi-purpose presser foot but that's it.

The other two machines I have are also both Singers.  One is a Golden (I think
limited) Edition Touch and sew that came in a GORGEOUS cabinet.  It was filthy,
wasn't working and I almost freecyled it.  But, Bryan and I cleaned the hell
out of her and got her working.  I adjusted the tension and found all the
original cams for her and it's a BEAUTY.  This model goes on ebay for at least
a couple hundred bucks.  It's the good OLD all metal geared machine.  WOW!  I
basically stole that from an estate sale, as well.

Last but not least, I have a 1950-something Singer 500A.  It's very atomic age
looking and was aptly nicknamed "The Rocketeer"  This is an all metal geared
AND bodied machine that I have seen go for several hundred dollars on ebay. 
Mine is in mint condition with all necessary cams and attachments.  I ran
wonderfully the day we got it because it was serviced and just left in a
closet.  It was also an estate sale find and you would laugh yourself silly
when you found out how little I paid for him.  LORD.

While I love my Husqvarna Viking, I adore all the old Singer machines I have a
little bit more.  There is something about making things on a machine that
someone else loved before me.

Two topic: first with a long explanation

I've been wanting a sewing machine for a while. I was set on a Singer - because
"everyone knows" you don't buy anything but a singer. Now I discover that isn't
the case- today's singer isn't my mother's singer (my mom has a Zig Zag 750).
They're plasticised crap, at least on the lower end. Friends tell me they've
gone through three to five infant mortalities before FINALLY getting a good
machine - both of which exhibited timing issues. One eventually sold the new
one and found a good used 1970s Zig Zag.

So, I've been reading reviews, researching the Vikings, Brothers, and so forth.
I've been directed to Viking by friends (if I plan to buy new), or to find a
used Zig Zag 750 like my mom's.

I came across the CE-150 and CE-250. A few months ago, I was at a client site
and their PC-controlled embroidery machine was down - actually, it had been
sort of sabotaged by a disgruntled employee. The service tech was unable to
bring it into adjustment and had no idea how to work the software, so they
asked me if I could check it out. I hadn't worked with one before but I've used
sewing machines, so I figured, why not? The worst I could do is not get it
working. Well, I got it working and adjusted over a couple of hours, and got to
play around with it. I remember thinking "I wish they had a home version of
this." The CE-250 comes close to what I wished for. :) I have access to the
embroidery machine at my client's however if I do what I would want to use it
for, I'd be abusing my welcome.

Anyway, now to my point: Has anyone used the CE-250? Is the quality as bad as
their other consumer models, or at that price level ($700 to $900) is it at the
quality levels of their commercial models, which I understand are still solid?
Failing that, does Viking or Brother have an equivalent model where I can
create my own design on the PC in an illustration or image editing program
(Illustrator/Inkscape/Photoshop/gimp) and import it into their suite and
control the machine from the PC, like you can with the CE-250?

Second topic: Jeans patterns

This is the main reason for wanting the embroidery machine rather than a
standard sewing machine is I like embellished jeans. Unfortunately my favorite
manufacturer seems to have gone under. So, if I want the designs I like, I'll
have to make them myself. Where are some good pattern sites for jeans? I
generally like slim-fit jeans. I found a couple of patterns online but I'm
finding mostly dress pants.

and I'll practice a good bit on scrap fabric to get a feel for lining up the

hoop kit (not a continuous hoop though) to make the process a little easier.

the Gigahoop alone is about $59 bucks from what I can tell online.  If you need
software it's gonna be more expensive.  I've talked to people who use Embird to
split their designs.  I think Amazing Designs also does it with their Edit N
Stitch software.  I figure most of us who use machine embroidery have a
software package of some kind that we use that is most likely capable of
splitting the design.

Just cancelled my CE-250 order, I found a CE-150 package with all of the
software included for the same price. I called Singer and they said the only
thing I would be missing is the extra stitches. The 250 I had ordered did
not include the "autopunch" software so I'd have to had to spend an
additional $300 to convert my own graphics to the embroidery formats. I'm
better off since it's really my first machine of my own. If I need the
additional features later I'll upgrade or if I find I use it enough I'll
look at the viking. I didn't want an embroidery-only unit though and being
able to control it directly from the PC is a huge plus for me so I needed
the USB connectivity.

But it was $30, and there were about 6 patent #s stamped on it dating from
about 1817 to 1881. I thought about buying it to sell, but after some more
searches I think it wouldn't be worth more than $100.
But it is just so neat I may buy it anyway.
I'm not even sure what you'd call the type of it. It's not electric, it has a
big pump pedal. And if I bought for my own use, it would be nice to be able to
work it or fix it up a bit if need be. So luckily White seems to still have
that info available.

and maybe I'm just looking for people to tell me it's worth buying? LOL

I learned how to crochet from watching this video

Crochet from Start to Finishing with Bev Dillon - it's available in VHS and DVD

I checked it out from my library. I watched the whole video a few times and
then bought the DVD later. I think you can watch most of it through youtube if
you can't find it otherwise.

It was perfect - had over the hands views of what she was doing, she explained
things really well, taught you how to read patterns, etc.

All you need to start is a crochet hook (i recommend size G) and some yarn (Red
Heart Super Saver is good for learning since it is cheap, it doesn't snag on
hooks, lots o colors etc)

I'm allergic to wool so I only use cotton and synthetic yarns but bamboo yarns
are really nice for crocheting.

Are you wanting to make clothes or dish cloths or ??

I frequent estate sales and garage sales A LOT and... it's just come to my

About 90% of the lot are vintage and I have one complete set of 12 different

Hobby Lobby and using one until I got confused, then moving to a different one
to see if it taught the same step in a different way or with a different
picture.  It took me probably 8 weeks to teach myself to the point at which I
coulc actually MAKE something.  I got very frustrated a couple of times and had
to put it down for a week at a time or so.  You can also use this method and go
on the web when you come to a step that you can't understand--if you are stuck
on a stitch that you can't do, just type it into Google.  "Double stitch
crochet video" and you'll find at least 10 videos of somebody's hands doing the
stitch.

to get their hands on a copy and are willing to lend it out, make me a copy or
something, let me know!  I am willing to pay something for it but, it's on
amazon for $24.95 and that is JUST under their free shipping and I really don't
want to pay that much for it.

If you are at a garage sale and see a copy of it and it's NOT expensive, grab
it and I will pay you for it and shipping.  I would rather not pay more than
$10 for it used.  Thanks so much!

I need some help.  I need to make a Max costume by next thursday.  I am talking

piece suit.  The hood could be separate.  I would like to make it out of fleece
rather than fur because I have to wear it in a classroom and it would be WAY
TOO HOT in this heat for fun fur.

Any thoughts?  I can make artistic additions but, I need to find something
online for an easy one piece costume for adults.  I can adjust for size.

Max Costume>  How does this sound?  I take my biggest long sleeve shirt and my
biggest pair of jeans.  I lay it out on the material and trace it out as just
one piece.  I cut and then sew.  I am thinking of doing it this way because:
1>  it's EASY
2>  this is a jumper that doesn't have to fit well, just look cute
Could this method work?  It sounds too easy so it must be like way off.  I plan
on making the hood separate anyway so, that should be okay.

I AM SO EXCITED!

Oh, man, I would try almost any other cleaning product before using even
diluted bleach.  I would try something ammonia-based, and probably white
vinegar....but almost everything that would make the mold "go away" would
probably not kill it permanently.  Mold is tough to kill.  One more thing that
is sometimes recommended is a very diluted solution of tea tree oil with water.
 Like 1 teaspoon tea tree to 1 cup water.

Hydrogen peroxide works very well for mold. So does 90% isopropyl alcohol.

Before trying peroxide, try it in a corner if your carpet is made of natural
fibers.

Another thing you can try is oxy-clean or similar products.

Or, you could search for enzyme-based rug cleaners. DON'T shampoo a carpet.
All you do with shampoo is make the carpet sticky. If you want to clean it
properly, steam clean it.

They look at counterfeits as counterfeits. You can have something that doesn;t
even remotely resemble currency but if you try to pass it off as such (say, a
$3 bill featuring Bill Clinton) as real currency you can be prosecuted for
passing counterfeit currency. You can make a replica as long as you make it
clear you are not attempting to pass it off as the real thing.  For an iron-on
applique I would not worry about it at ALL.

butterfly theme going on with some of the other decorations.
i did a google search for purple crystal butterflies, but am just coming up
with jewelery.  i'm looking for more like a pack of them i could hot glue to
the basket or something.  i kind of looked at Michaels and Hobby Lobby while we
were there this weekend, but couldn't find what i wanted there either.

I need help with the following fleece hat pattern.

In step 2, I'm supposed to sew the long ends, forming a tube. This doesn't make
sense, if there is only one panel for this hat, and I'm supposed to fold right
sides in, wouldn't I sew the two short ends? I'm thinking by folding the panel,
it looks like a rectangle. One long side would be the fold line, the other long
side would be open. (I have to say this is why I prefer pictures along with the
written instructions)

Reading through the directions and never having made this hat, it looks like
you're sewing the long ends as the sides, the open ends are the top and bottom,
then you fold up part of the bottom for a cuff, sew it, then sew up the top.
Here's another version of the directions on a different site:

Giraffe, I didnt look at the husqvarna that closely, although I think they OEM
it, from another company. It has sensors to detect objects to avoid, and it has
sensors to turn off if it may have flipped over, and it has a gps tracker on it
to help locate it if it has been stolen. :)

It -may- require something like a wire in the ground to keep it form going out
of bounds like the dog "invisible fence".

If it could merely go back and forth and do the zero-turn thing, i would think
it would 2-3x its range.

Read this online about coffee grounds:

Not only do coffee grounds make an excellent fertilizer for acid-loving plants,
they can be used to combat any pesky ant problem you may have in your home or
yard. Sprinkle used coffee grounds around the outside perimeter of your house
to keep ants from sneaking in through unseen cracks and crevices. Spread some
coffee grounds around the mounds you find in your yard to discourage ants from
colonizing new territory. You can also use coffee grounds inside your house,
because (unlike chemical pesticides) coffee is safe for both children and pets.
Did you discover ants in your pantry? Think coffee grounds. Did someone break
the ant farm? Think coffee grounds!

Coffee is only safe for pets if they don't eat it.  They can easily get a
caffeine overdose from eating the grounds, and many dogs will do that.  Just
keep it in mind if you have one (and avoid the cocoa mulch for your garden as
well)

I also hear that coffee grounds are a slug deterrent. Never tried it myself.
Putting hazelnut shells around the slug attracting plants seems to do the trick
& the birds/squirrels/possums/nature creatures like that some of the shells
still have hazelnuts in them. Unlike peanut shells, my dogs have shown no
interest in the hazelnut shells

grounds are usually dried so they spread easier. You get more coverage, but

No, but if they are attracted enough to the scent of the grounds they won't

We were lucky, as we accidently left a whole cannister of coffee (with lid on)
on our countertop about two years ago. We don't drink coffee, but had someone
visiting who did and didn't think about the potential problem. Our very smart
and able dog apparently jumped onto the counter, peeled the lid of the coffee
can back, took one whiff and decided it wasn't for him. I kid you not, he
didn't spill a single ground and just barely disturbed the the surface of the
grounds. I suspect that if he could have, he would have put the lid back on.
Thankfully, coffee, unlike chocolate, held no interest for him.

So, a friend of mine makes biodiesel.  A "waste" product of that reaction is
glycerine.  So, he gives the stuff away by the bucketful as soap.  He says he
uses it in the shower, on cars, laundry, dishwasher, etc. and has even washed
his kids with it.  It's a dark orange/rusty color and pretty thick.  No scent,
other than...I don't know...earthy?  It doesn't mix well with water (I tried
thinning it out for a foaming soap dispenser).  Any really good ideas for what
I could use this stuff for?  I don't particularly like it for bathing (I'm
addicted to my good-smelling stuff, yes I'll probably die of cancer, but I'll
leave a nice-smelling corpse) and my hands don't really feel clean after
washing with it (probably because it's not stripping all the oils off).  Other

If he makes that much of it (or you get that much from him!), you might be able
to sell it to commercial users for a variety of products, or donate it to
universities or other research institutions.  A lot of places are looking at
ways to use it.  A lot depends on the purity, of course; most commercial
applications require it to be pure glycerine, so they'd have to purify
anything... so it might not be worth that much, but in bulk?

Another, more intriguing (to me) use: mix it with sawdust or wood chips, fill
used milk cartons with the mixture, and use it instead of timber/ firewood, be
it for heating your house in winter, or water in a bath (this assumes having a
cauldron-style bathtub) or cooking (assuming a wood-burning stove), etc. One
experimenter using this method (I read it online) heated a Japanese
iron-cauldron bath with three one-liter milk cartons, which burned for about 45
minutes and heated 100 liters of water from room temp to about 140 degrees F.
He said in sub-zero (Celsius, so sub-freezing) winter weather, the same took
five cartons instead of three.  He heated water for baths this way for about a
year.

I don't think it is worth much commercially. IIRC it was around 44 cents a
pound for medical grade, and like 20 cents a pound for industrial grade.
Probably any maker of biodiesal will just give it to you, they can't get rid of
it either.

Here is a soap making recipe:
http://www.millersoap.com/glycerinsoap.html
you need a high purity alcohol, they say ethanol, or isopropyl in a pure form
will work. Then you can add your own smelly stuff to it, and give it away as
christmas presents.. If you get really good, you can make soap on a rope. lol
Actually I used to know some people that really liked making the molds for it
and sold quite a bit of it.

 "You ask, who are these guys. We are the living experiment. This is the epic
story of a band of pioneers. Several families who have uprooted  from
comfortable suburbia and made their homes for good in one of the most blighted
zip codes in the US. 64127, Lykins Neighborhood, inner city, Kansas City."
 "In the following episodes, you will see our journey as we dive into
everything from urban fish farming to reducing crime rates in the neighborhood.
From job creation to getting healthy food in the hands of everyday people...
 "We are searching the ends of the earth to find the most reproduceable,

 Why might you say that? Making much better progress than I am to get "off the
grid" and lower my "carbon footprint" and draw in the community for concerted
effort. And, as an individual, I have made great improvements in the past 5
years. Well, I think.

 I've no doubt that there are improvements that could be made. But these people
are bringing something cheap and real to the 'general' public. You don't have
to be a hippy or a yuppie to make use of these new and old enlightments.

 It seems to me that their message is not so much to do with saving the
environment (a side benefit), but so much as bringing a community together. The
simple fact that their mission statement involves the reduction of community
crime... (not associated with any traditional Green movement).

 This movement that they propone... is an effort for the impoverished to
improve their situations in every way, not just with an influence based on
Green. (Though, saving a life by eco-friendly farming and not getting Gangsta
shot not only saves the environment but keeps us from $100,000 in hospital
bills). Go them.

K. How can they improve what they are doing?  They are open-source, give
and ask for input. Tell us (cause I wanna know, too!), and then tell them!

Speaking of recycling.
The paper bins here now have a new sticker on them stating that they don't take
phone books.
I know (from a HS paper or presentation, I forget which) that the US used to
pay to ship those to Korea where the paper was recycled and then the US bought
it back. The reason given for doing this? The paper was deemed too cheap a
grade to be recycled in the U.S.
It Arbiti isn't taking them I have no idea how they'll be recycled in the KC
Metro Area as they are the only paper recycling bins.

And in metal recycling, the scrap yard I sell to used to take aerosol cans if
you put a gash in the side (to release any pressure inside so they won't
explode when they melt them down). Now you have to cut them in half (this
applies to steel and aluminum aerosol cans).
I'll do it as I strongly believe in recycling but I believe this will deter
many people from recycling them.

Now if only you could recycle AAA, AA, C, D and 9 Volt batteries (Button cell
batters must be taken by jewelry stores). 6 Volt batteries are a crap shoot.
Some scrap yards will accept them and some will now (so I have experienced over
the years). The one I sell to currently won't take those you can buy at places
like Walmart for use in flashlights.
NiCad, Lithium, Nickle Metal Hydride and some special sizes you use in cameras
are also off-limits. To recycle those you have to make calls to find special
places to take them.

Too bad there aren't easier ways to recycle them.

The aerosol requirement reminds me of a couple of girls who talked to us about
recycling back in 2000. They yold us that the recycling company would force us
to give them all our recyclable trash washed. O RLY? You expect the Average Joe

for phone books, it is the binding. The glue causes a lot of issues with the
shredder and with the reprocessing process. If you cut the binding off, then it
is like a regular low-grade paper, which is worth about 30 bucks a ton.

We recycle them now.. But im sure they are shipped somewhere, probably
overseas, where the paper is worth a lot more money because of cheaper labor
and the lack of raw materials in the native country.

So we bought a Toyota Prius about 3 months ago and have been loving it thus
far.  We find we need to fill it up about 1/2 as often as we did our last car
(A Toyota Corolla) because we do mostly in city driving which is lots of stop
and go which runs the electric battery a lot.

I've got to admit we didn't even know about the fact that the car is
dramatically better about pollution emissions than the average car - we just
evaluated the current crop of cars based on our needs, and decided it was a
good fit.

Feoh-- that's good to know. My husband and I may be looking soon. I absolutely
do not like our current car. I want an automatic transmission this time for
sure-- I can't get comfortable enough to drive his stick (which also has no AIR
CONDITIONING) He bought it on his own while we were dating, so I hadnt yet
graduated to getting a say in the features, but man. When I complain about no
A/C people always say -- "Wait, they make cars without it?" ANd of course, the
answer is yes, but no one buys them, so when my then-BF was buying the last
models on the lot to save money, lo, there was no A/C. pfft.

(The stick shift also means I have no arm room in the passenger side of our
Honda Civic. This annoys me greatly, as well as having to watch my knees when
he shifts gear or I get whacked in the knee. )

What is funny to me is that in a few years, teenagers will think -- what, they
made cars without GPS?

Actually, the biggest reason I'd like us to wait on a new car is that right now
there is an explosion of options like never before.  You can get a hybrid, you
can get GPS, OnStar, Automatic parking, a video screen when you back up, all
kinds of things. Even arm room and safe knee areas!

I do want to get a car that is environmentally friendly, and bonus if it has
some comfort factors.

Feoh, Trillian>   assuming you're in the US, are the economic diesels kicking
in there as well, or not really?  Over here (Netherlands) they're immensely
popular, mostly due to favourable tax regulations and very economic use.  We
pay a lot less for diesel than for gasoline (20-30%).

Apart from the price, the prius made me wonder about the environmental impact
of all those batteries.  I haven't heard or read any objective comparisons yet.
Do you know of any?

Just for reference, our fiat punto (I'd guess 1 size smaller than a prius) runs
about 21:1 (km/l) on average, which would be about 49 miles to the gallon.  On
paper it should be able to do 27:1 (63 miles per gallon), but I've never done
better than 24:1 for more than half a tank (55 mpg).

now, if you're willing to pay more to feel better about your car, that's not

they remain a generally bad deal.

definitely go with the built in nav.  People on the web complain because you
can't change the destination once the car is started, but we went from a
stand-alone Garmin Nuvi with the COrolla to the Prius's built in nav and it's a
big upgrade in many little ways.

As to the batteries, they're guaranteed for like 7 years and some crazy
thousands of miles - pretty much the lifetime of the car - so I'm no expert but
that seems pretty environmentally sound right there.

Depends on your definition of "lifetime of the car" though, too.  I'm currently
in a 1999 Toyota with 124K miles on it.  That's twice the time of the battery
guarantee on a Prius, and I don't think my car is remotely close to its life
expectancy yet.  If I did, it wouldn;t be slated to go to my daughter in a year
and a half when she heads to university.
And then there's the question of environmental impact of the abtteries when the
time comes that they _do_ go, and need to be recycled.  We'll see how that goes
in just a few years when the first generation of hybrid batteries come to time.
Now, do I think hybrids are better environmentally?  In the long run, probably.
But likely only marginally, all things considered.

A great way to get improved gas mileage in a normal non-hybrid, non-diesel car
is to drive a manual transmission. Manuals tend to get significantly better gas
mileage than automatics. The only thing comparable right now are the new CVTs.
I bought a Nissan Versa with a CVT last fall for $15k and it averages 34 mpg
with lots of city driving. On longer trips, 40 mpg isn't uncommmon. My older
Dodge Neon with a manual gets pretty good gas mileage, too.

A great way to get improved gas mileage in a normal non-hybrid, non-diesel car
is to drive a manual transmission. Manuals tend to get significantly better gas
mileage than automatics.



Well... in 1953 they did.


Modern autos get better mileage than manuals do though.

(note some cheaper cars still used old auto tech where that's not the case, but
that's becoming the exception rather than the norm anymore)



we went over this a while back in 171>... I listed like 20 or 30 current models
where the auto got better mileage than the manual.  (and a lot of cars don't
even bother offering a manual anymore, they're antiques really)

I know that if you get a car with great mileage per gallon you might just beat
the MPG of a hybrid.  We've got a lot of test drives ahead of us, I am sure.

I actually like the Automatic version of our Civic... didnt feel any of the
disadvantages like I do in the stick shift.

And sure, the Prius has a whole different, slightly wierd seating and
viewing... I might need a booster seat to drive it :) hehe.

I think we have to look at things carefully. I hope we can wait another year,
when the next Cleveland Auto Show comes out, to buy with the discounts and have
plenty of test drives and looking at features.

*heh* According to the car seat laws in some states, if I weren't an adult I'd
need a car seat to drive, period!  But that's a (recurring) debate for another
forum.

As to manual vs auto: what Knightshade said.  That really isn't true any more.
There are a number of reasons to prefer manuals (some people simply like them,
for one; they generally have quicker pickup from zero for two; they're cheaper
for three...), but as many reasons not to (higher maintenance costs; harder to
drive, especially as we get older (think knees)) to name a couple.  And most
models, especially in the US, sinply aren't even available in manuals any more.
But either way, the gas mileage savings isn;t going to be that much, really. 
Especially not with the greater efficiency of modern automatics.  All told, I
think there are probably a lot more effective ways to "go green" than auto vs
manual vs hybrid.  Doesn't mean I wouldn't get a hybrid... I do think they're
somewhat better, if marginally, and I like the idea.  And cost-wise, I don;t
think gas is going down any time soon or ever (overall).  It won't be
$20/gallon next week or next year... but it's not going to be $2.09 again,
either, probably ever.  So in that respect, hybrids only become a better deal
as time goes on.

Hm... I'd debate the higher maintenance costs. If my manual transmission shits
itself, it's going to be far far cheaper to replace it than if an auto

On the gas savings account, the better efficiency on autos is something I've
only seen in the expen$ive cars.

actually checked-

Yeah, in the under 15k category it seems of the cars that come in both auto and
stick it's about like this:


10% the auto gets significantly worse mileage (>1 mpg difference)
50% the auto gets 1 mpg worse
30% the auto gets the same as the manual
10% the auto gets 1 mpg better than the manual

So the "better" autos are already showing up in the cheapest category, but
they're just starting to.

The few that are still "bad" (that bottom 10%) are leftovers still using
ancient 4 speed autos versus 5-6 speed manuals.

The ones where the autos tie or beat the manuals are more modern 6 speed autos

Knightshade>  diesel is definitely cheaper here, especially if you were to
ignore the road tax difference (but that's not fair).  What are the rates for
road tax and gallon prices in the US, for diesel vs gas cars?

Here (taking a fiat punto as an example) it's about 250 EUR per year (gas) or
1000 EUR per year (diesel) road tax, and the current liter prices are about
1.40 EUR (diesel) and 1.75 (gas).

The difference in tax is compensated after about 20k kilometers, taking into
account the rough difference in fuel economy.  Add a no-sales tax (one-time
3-5k savings) and 2 years of no road tax, and it's well worth it.

How does that compare to the US situation?  I assume not nearly as good for
diesel, given the lack of popularity?

There's actually a bunch more examples (Ford alone has several) but hopefully
you've gotten the point by now...

the manual transmission is a relic...an antique... and in anything but outdated
or truely bottom-end cars you're generally going to get better mileage (and
performance by the way) out of a modern automatic.

In another 5 years the clutch pedal will likely vanish even out of most
bottom-end models... in the same dustbin of history as the hand-cranked engine.

It was "last reviewed" in 2011.

Not really sure what 'reviewed' means in this case, but it's not when the
original story was written.




But yeah, the ability to "push start" is the only practical advantage left to a
manual, versus the numerous disadvantages when compared to an automatic.

The CR 0-60 testing is somewhat deceptive as well, as modern autos are almost
always quicker than their manual counterparts too, since computers shift far
quicker and more reliably than humans do... and even in "manual" mode it's far
quicker to shift with a paddle than a clutch pedal (again a lesson F1 learned
many years ago... and one of the many reasons a PDK porsche for example crushes
the track times of one with a 3rd pedal in it)

I currently use a weeding fork.  I want to prevent them from growing in the
first place so I don't have to use weeder, spray, water, vinegar.  I'm lazy and
want to stop them.  crack filler may be a good idea, but I wonder about filling
the cracks that are supposed to be there (I asusme for expanding due to temp).
If I fill them, will that cause issues.

  Typically, the crack fillers are rubberish so they can allow the cement
  to expand/contract.

Try corn gluten meal.  You use it twice a year (generally), and it supresses
weeds for 4-6 weeks.  It inhibits seed generation as soon as it cracks open to
sprout.

The twice a year thing I think is more for lawns.  I would presume you can use
it more often in your situation, it's not like you want to save the grass
there.

crack filler does indeed expand and contract. It also helps prevent water from
getting inbetween the cement that causes breakage.  It is the best and nicest
looking solution. However, I would do the preen, corn gluten, hot water,
or whatever thing first to make sure you dont have any seeds left to germinate
to break through it.

I am also misunderstanding why you even care if it is All Natural.. Given
most driveways have toxic oil spillage, rubber, etc on them anyway.

My husband shops for a dozen or so priests twice a week, and ends up with tons
of platic bags. (One local store we joke likes 1 item per bag)

There are recycling bins for them at the grocery we use, but the most useful
way I reuse them is to give them to the library-- especially on rainy days or
books sale days. They are thrilled. They keep a bin for the bags, so I just
drop them in the bin. Then I know the bag gets another use. Also, many times
the stores make their bags blue, which some 'burbs require your recyclables to
be in.

At home, we ask for paper bags, to hold recycled paper and drop the whole
shebang into the paper recycling bin the city has. The city makes money on it
and I figure that keeps my taxes down a few pennies. Maybe a few more pennies
at new phonebook occassions.

For our garbage around the house, I use Target bags. Nice and thick plastic,
holds on to the lips of the bins, and most of the time I can just dump out
whats in it into a big garbage bag and reuse the Target bag again, a good half
dozen or more times because of the strength.

Which is why the night before garbage night, I run around dumping all the trash
into one bag, getting all the recycling together, and then know I have done my
best. I recycle more than I landfill! :)

Oxyclean pails we use to soak small objects, or else to organize markers or
other objects. One has all my gym earbuds and locks and such.

I have a project I want to do eventually: take red plastic flodgers coffee cans
and put some adhesive between them to make a "hive" shaped cluster, where small
objects can live in a nook in my office.

Eventually I will even figure out what I want to do with my dozens of jars that
all match (from Indian Sauces) Maybe hold office supplies on a shelf, each with
a colored band around them?

I have too many ideas and not enough time!
Especially when I want to read all the time, too.
This is why my office is cluttered:
Yarns, photos, cards, crafts, sewing, painting, drawing, writing. I have
baskets for each one!!!

I totally get why people want to ban the plastic grocery bags.  Hell, I sort of
like them but when I buy 15 items at the store and the bagger uses 11 bags to
package them up I feel like that's pretty stupid.

I'm gradually weaning myself from them.  I use them to carry my lunch out to
the car and from the car to work and I use them to throw scraps of chicken fat
or shrimp shells in so I can dispose of them right away instead of having them
sit in the tregular kitchen trash can smelling the place up.

I do find them convenient for some things but I'll learn to live without (my
town is banning them later this year).

Yorick> it's unfortunate she chose plastic. Paper bags offer better insulation
for your product.

The upside of plastic bag bans is that it helps to reduce litter on the street
and out of our sewers and rivers. The downside is that since the mid-1980s,
plastic bags have been manufactured so that they break down faster than paper
bags when buried in landfills. So you'll reduce the amount of work the
sanitation department has to perform, but you'll end up increasing the amount
of landfills we need to store them if they're not recycled.

It does, if you don't reuse/ recycle the paper bags.  And paper is a lot easier
to recycle, as well as decomposes much faster and less harmfully.  So there is
that.
That said, the point about paper bags and rain is a good one... and of course,
the making of paper bags requires trees as well, thus deforestation, and the
ills associated there.  So... reuseable cloth/ canvas/ etc (so-called "green")
bags?  Well... except that they reportedly use more resources and cause more
pollution in making than they prevent.
So what to do? *heh*  I use "green" and other reuseable bags, but I also us
eplastic grocery ones for food scraps, trash can liners, dirty laundry when
travelling, storing things, etc.  All I can do, really.
I also wonder about bag bans, how effective they can be, unless most of an area
gets on board.  For instance: two of Texas' biggest cities have passed bans on
single use bags from grocery and other retailers, those being Brownsville and
Austin.  But none of the Austin suburbs have, and that's a considerable amount
of stores and population.  And none of the other cities and towns near
Brownsville have (Harlingen, McAllen, Edinburg, etc).  That area is very fluid;
all of those cities are within an hour of one another, and people shop and
travel all across the region.  So no way will Austin or Brownsville get rid of
plastic bags via their bans.

Yeah, I have close to that myself, between the cotton, nylon, and plastic (made

though is that between the energy used, etc in making them, the net gain isn't
much in terms of their "green-ness" if not even a loss, at least according to a
couple studies I've seen.  They wear out after a time; much depends on the
length of time, and the studies seemed to find in most cases they didn't last
long enough to make it worthwhile.

As far as the -litter- argument. I don't see a lot of them. But we have
a bottle recycling law, so people aren't as inclined to throw stuff out
the window while driving. It doesn't -stop- it. But it does significantly

people don't like to pay fees to dispose of stuff at the landfill and they dumb
things like tvs, monitors, appliances, hot water heaters, on the side of the
road, usually down an incline right next to the river, because it's accessible
by old rail road tracks and no one can see. It's disgusting what people do to
avoid a $5 or less fee. Or, you know, wait until one of the several days a year

I think the imposition of a fee charged to people to do something they don't
want to do in the first place is why that happens.  If it were free (the cost
being hidden in local taxes or somesuch) people would be more likely to dispose

federal wilderness area we live by, so their way of showing that is dumping
trash all over that someone else has to clean up. The landfill is 8 miles from
town, it's a lot easier (because they are that lazy) to drive a mile down the
road and dump it next to the river. Those same people are the ones who raise

Strange how that bag thing developed so differently in the states compared to
here (netherlands/europe).  We hardly get these flimsy plastic bags you get in

polyethylene bags.  The kind you get in shopping-stores to put new clothes in.

Then they started to make people pay for those, and they sort-of went away, but
not quite.  Now grocery stores all offer much more durable, large,
plastic/nylon bags which last for years.  I love them, 3 of them fill the boot
of my car.

At the moment I only receive bags (the somewhat more durable kind) when doing

Easter eggs of Google has became a bit more famous these days after the release
of some easter eggs like tilt, do a barrel roll etc.. than it was before.


Here is a small list of Easter eggs of google given below and with time passing
the list would be updated with the help of both ourselves and our readers
suggestions.

The Easter eggs of Google work in browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox 7+
versions and some of the easter eggs can be used from clicking on the "I'm
feeling Lucky" button with the corresponding codes for their corresponding
effects. For people who have instant search on it must be disabled to activate
"I'm feeling Lucky" button and it can be done by Options b
Also calculation of any numbers like 5*7896 or 98756*(765425/576943) etc.. in
equation form when typed in search bar provides the exact answer for it.

"the answer to life, the universe, and everything" gets 42 in result.
"the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything"
also gets 42.
"the lonliest number" gets 1.
"the number of horns on a unicorn" gets 1.
"a bakers dozen" gets 13.
"once in a blue moon" gets 1.16699016  10-8 hertz

2) Google Search Easter eggs(7) ---->

Searching for "tilt" or "askew" makes the page to tilt to its right a bit.
"recursion" shows did u mean: recursion and allows the searcher to recursively
search for recursion.
"do a barrel roll" or "z or r twice" results in 360 degree rotation of the
page. The same barrel rolling for this page of the site can also be done by
clicking the link TipsNTweaks Barrel roll.
"anagram" shows did u mean: nag a ram.
"ascii art" and then check out the google logo in top left to the search bar.

3) I'm feeling Lucky easter eggs(32) --->

There are many easter eggs in this category and it will be more fun for the
user to try it unknowingly of what is the output of the search so the search
results for these things aren't explained here.

"google sphere"
"google loco"

a renewable energy page rest has same effect with corresponding color
difference as typed)
"google pond" (also google painter gives the same effect of that an google pond
instead of the painter one's which can also be seen in next easter egg's
category with direct links given below)

the one Firefox was "supposed" to show me til I pulled up the other page.

Incidentally, for yet more:  Southwestern University, in Georgetown Tx, had
umwelt as the topic of their annual Brown Symposium in 2008.  See:

Short version: the actress (Anna Gurji) was hired for a role in a farcical film
called "Desert Warriors" - which later was overdubbed to become the now
infamous "Innocence of Muslims."  She's now terrified.

I was trying to drink a glass of milk in the dream (I've been drinking a lot of
milk in real life because of a sore throat) and blood began to appear in the
glass.  I thought at first that I must have a nosebleed, and that blood had
fallen into the milk (though I didn't actually see that happen).  I remember
the striking contrast of the red against the white.  I took up a gallon milk
jug, but blood began to appear in that too, more and more of it.  I decided
that I needed to pour out the jug in the sink, and I remember there being less
fluid in the jug than I thought (less than a quart), and being thankful that I
wasn't wasting more milk.  Then I went to turn on the water to clean up the
blood, which I thought must be on my hands and face as well as in the sink.

Then the faucets *disappeared*.  Right in front of my eyes, just vanished as if
they had never been there, with a solid wall where they had been.

At that point I became convinced that I was dreaming, and not being too keen on
being in a dreamworld with magically appearing blood and disappearing faucets,
I began to make a concerted effort to awaken.  (I slapped my own face,
repeatedly, and shouted "wake up!" at myself. :) )  This worked, though not
until after a minute or so of panic that I wasn't going to be able to get out
of the dream...

I'm afraid that's not very enlightening: it's just milk, and blood, in a very
prosaic context (a kitchen, similar to but slightly different from the one I
actually have).  And no water :).

I think your dream is telling you not to drink milk when you have a sore
throat. For one thing, it increases mucous.

Gargle with salt water instead. And eat stuff flavored with cayenne pepper.
That'll soothe your throat better than anything.

What strikes me about the dream is the white and red.  The white reminds me of
something pure.  Drinking or eating something pure, not in a literal way but
what in your life are you taking in or digesting mentally that started out as
pure.  The blood strikes me in two different ways.  Blood is a part of life,
but also could have a somewhat negative vibe too.  I tend to go more towards
the life than the dracula.  What you are taking in cannot remain pure, very few
things can but has to have some life or reality infused in it.  You may have
liked the pureness of it and that is why you gave dumped it after it is
tainted, but the disappearance of the faucet seems to me to say this is
something you can't wash away.  I'm not sure if I'm making sense and of course
this is just one possible interpretation.

Call me Legs>
My first time posting here. I suppose I'm not looking for a solution, although
any interpretation ideas would be interesting. I'm just looking to share, and
hopefully get this dream out of my mind. I so rarely have nightmares. Even my
"scary" dreams are more action or adventure. But a disturbing, disgusting dream
is extremely rare for me - maybe a handful in my whole life.
32 year old married female.
In my dream last night I'm laying there, and I suppose I'm naked. At the top of
my legs, in that dip between leg, mound, and belly, I look down. On the right
side, I notice two holes. As I look at them, perplexed, I notice it looks more
like there's one hole, but the skin has reconnected at a point across the top.
I try to look in and see what may be inside. Should I try to close the skin
completely, or should it be open and laying flat open? As I'm looking at this,
I notice at the pint where the skin is attached there's a spot. A mole? I look
at the left side to try to compare. Maybe that will give me a clue.
I look to the left and I see some scrapes, scabs? It looks a bit more puffy. I
poke at one mark, but it turns out to be a large mole. I poke at another, but
it's just a bit of a scrape. I start to pick at a third sopt and it's a bit of
an infected scab. As I pull it off, it releases some gas that's been trapped
inside underneath. I can now peek in through this hole and I see some small
objects. They are almost like snail shells, and as I shift they roll around
slightly bouncing off each other making a crisp sound. But they aren't snails,
they are spores or something. One rattles out and I can look at it. It's smooh,
again, like a snail shell. I'm disgusted, but glad I can see it. It appears
inert, but I know it's only hibernating, or something. I set that one aside and
now am concerned about all the rest still inside that hole in my thigh-ish
area. I try to roll over so they could tip and fall out the hole. I consider
squirting something in to flush them out. They seem a bit bigger than the hole,
so I consider maybe I could reach in and grab them with chopsticks. (I'm very
good at problem solving and logic in my dreams) As I'm considering what to
squirt in, I'm also concsidering that perhaps it would wake them up and they'd
try to bury into me. I'm stumped.
This is when I wake up. I'm absolutely disgusted, but it's so visceral that I
have to look and feel and ensure myself that the skin is still perfect and
smooth. No holes, no scabs, no shells or husks. It took a while to go back to
sleep, but even on waking this morning I had to examine myself, and look int he
mirror just to triple check. The images kept coming back to me this morning
and just making me slightly nauseaus. I don't want to tell DH as it'll gross
him out and that will accomplish nothing. So thank you for being there. Maybe
this can help it dissolve.

This is Legs here> Thanks for the note, and the dream was fading. However I'm
traveling on business for the tail end of this week. I'm in another state. As I
was walking to an office today, I noticed a snail was attached to the wall - it
was the exact size, shape, color, texture - everything from my dream! I've
never seen these things before, and as I looked down the wall, there were a
bunch around. The blue hues and slightly swirled colors, the smooth ripples ont
he shell - all precisely like my dream. I was immediately nauseaus.
Then as I was walking towards the parking lot near a trail, there were these
long thick blades of grass and tiny tiny snails had crawled up some of them.
Not like the ones in my dream, but still echoed it.
I hate traveling for business, and really dislike this location. Perhaps this
was a precognition, a foresight. I know, that sounds crazy, but I don't dream
about snails, have nightmares, and the snails here are all just very odd.

What might it mean to have a dream of someone (female, I am male) who meant a
lot to me some years ago, but have not thought about for some time. In the
dream, she is with an old childhood friend of mine who in RL did nothing with
his life. He worked at a junkyard for $100 a week, and this was what I recalled
in the dream. The female in RL was nearing her masters in psychology when we
split up.In the dream, the friend introduces me to her, I do not recall
anything spoken, what words used etc. The female and I pretended not to know
each other, but it was more awkward than just not wanting to acknowledge each
other. at some point while the friend was not looking, she held something up
which showed something of significance to the two of us from out time together.
In the dream, I have no idea what it was, just that it meant something.

Ok, kind of a strange dream last night. First of all, I have never been in the
military. In the dream, there were 4 people in a military humvee, and we were
sitting on an overpass bridge in a large city. Not a war torn area at all, but
a normal looking American city. we took up our position. It seemed like were
were acting more as a security detail than anything. Attitude was calm. There
was me, another guy and a woman of similar rank, and a Sgt who was in charge.
I saw a vehicle moving on the streets below, and let the Sgt know. He grabbed a
Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle from the back, and said he would try to get a
shot at it. It was as if we were looking for that vehicle, and what he was
doing was normal, and we were not to follow him, but remain at the humvee.
Time passes, and it is warm out. The other two are sitting in the humvee, all
the doors closed. It is as if they were trying to relax, were down to t-shirts
because of the heat.
I cannot remember what went on between that and the next part, but we were in
the desert, just the 3 of us, and it was dark. I cannot remember why the other
2 had left at some point, but it became just me. I felt like we should expect
some danger, so I checked my handgun, and found that someone had swapped it for
a squirt gun. I was pissed off, and immediately checked my rifle, and found
that it would not load a round. The humvee felt more like a van at that point,
with a large open cargo type area, with doors in the rear. At that moment,
someone came lunging in at me with a gun. (not sure why they just did not
shoot) I managed to get my knife out and slash him. I saw others coming in the
darkness, and still could not get the rifle to chamber a round. At that point,
I jumped up on the turret mounted machine gun and opened fire into the darkness
where I had seen them.
Then I woke up.

I dream a lot. All kinds of thing, often highly detailed. Mr Kyoti now knows
just to roll his eyes and listen, or pretend to. :) Usually the story line
makes some sense, often good fun adventures! There was a great one the other
night involving a spooky kind of house, this long lane leading up to it lined
with these lights hanging over it. The lights were actually held by people who
were hanging upside down, like big vampire bats. They were entangled in a cord
or vine or something, but that was their purpose. They weren't in pain or
upset. Anyways, one spoke to be. Can't remember what he said.
Anyways, had this dream the other night. It had the usual story line,
interesting  characters from people I know, etc. Then, like switching the
channel, there was a compelte interruption to another visualization. All the
noise and chatter of the ongoing story line broke and I'm standing on a dirt
road. There's two bears, brown bears, in the road. One slightly to the left is
kind of sitting on his bum lounging, the one slightly to my right is sitting
more forward. They're happy, lounging bears. Not threatening, except I'm aware
they are bears. There's a tortoise crawling from the one to my left across his
belly to the one to my right. The bears are touching each other they are
sitting so close. I remember saying "What are those two bears doing with a
tortoise?" And it wasn't a snapping turtle or something, I suppose a painted
turtle or box turtle or something.
Anyways, that fades and we're back into the story.
I don't have them often, I suppose those kind of dreams would be almost like
totemic dreams, if that's a term. I recall a significant one I had years ago
about a lioness. No idea if they mean anything, but they're curious to
consider.

Call me car ride
I have never had this happen in a dream before. Normally when I dream, it is
3rd person, or more like I am reliving a memory. Sometimes I do go to 1st
person, but I will drift back to 3rd. On occasion, I am just watching, not
knowing where it is going. Sometimes I am lucid enough to take the dream where
I want.
Always, I am in the now, even if the dream is of the past. I am living it in
the dream as I am now. The other night that changed. I regressed to a time I
was about 8 or 9. I remember this event well, and I relived it moment for
moment in the dream. Not repressing anything here. I was outside playing with
my puppy. I remember my brother nearby doing something. I lived close to other
family, so I recall cousins around as well as aunts etc etc. My mom told me to
bring the dog and get in the car. I had no idea what we were doing. I got in
back so I could play with the dog while we drove. I thought it was a trip to
the store, or anything else. It was not uncommon for her to yell at one of us
to come along.
Anyhow, we lived kind of in the country, but on a main highway. I noticed that
we were on some gravel road when my mom stopped. She opened the back door, took
my pup from my arms, put him in the road, hurried back to the car and drove
off. I looked on in horror as he tried to keep up with us, but soon he was
gone. Not a word was said from her as I cried. This is where I woke up to a
soaking wet pillow.
I have never regressed like that in a dream before. I recall this memory often,
as I think about my pup now. even past pets, I still think of him, and it makes
me love my pets more. In that dream, I was that little kid again. Normally, if
I dreamt that, I would be me now, just reliving it, and going along with the
memory.

In my dream, as in reality, I couldn't recall having done anything that would

Lately, I've had some odd dreams. The first concerned members of a well known
rock band, of which I am a fan. I dreamt that one of their members broke up
with his girlfriend and she broadcast it on the internet, which naturally
caused quite a stir. Given that this band likes to keep their private lives
private, that would be an unusual occurence. That same dream found another
member (who is known for being very outgoing, slightly hyper, etc.) getting
yelled at for being himself, basically, but not considering other people's
feelings when being himself. Even though he didn't really physically appear in
the dream, you could tell that being yelled at upset him greatly.

Last night, I dreamt that I owned a custom guitar of theirs. The two guitarists
do have custom models available to everyone, but I don't play guitar and
couldn't afford them if I did. I'm unemployed, so buying a guitar just isn't in
the cards right now.

Now, I am under some stress. I've been unemployed for several months and have
had no luck finding a job. I am starting to considering having a talk with my
SO about a "plan B" in case I reach the one year mark without a job, and do
stress over that talk. I have generally found such talks with my SO highly
stressful. Any idea if there is any meaning to these strange dreams?

I've been married for going on 4 years now, and have been surprised at how
infrequently my wife appears in my dreams.  Not that I expected my
subciouscious to suddenly morph when I said I do, but she's such a big part of
my life I would expect her to be a part of that space as well.  Then again most
of my dreams are set in and around the house I grew up in (and haven't lived in
for 20+ years) so I guess this should be less surprising to me :)

Strange dreams last night and not sure what the might mean, if anything.

In the first one, my face was covered in spikey hairs. They were black and
similar to the little wire hairs that some of us get on our faces. But there so
many of them, and I wasn't plucking them, just staring at them.

In the second, I dreamt that I was in a graveyard and there was a burial going
on. There was a small boy there who resembeled my current male partner. He was
walking around an open casket, and the officiate was shaking his fists in
frustation over something. The frame the casket was sitting on had come up a
bit and everything was tileted. A passerby fixed the frame which seemed to calm
the officiate. I also noticed that another open casket was behind the one about
to be buried, but the lid to the casket was partially off it's hinge (?) and
partially lying in the casket. In one of the caskets, a pair of glasses was
visible and the frame was quiet old. There was a third casket off in the
distance, but I didn't pay it much ind.

I'm not prone to dreaming about things like this and the second was a bit
disturbling. No one in the family is currenly ill enough to be near death, so
what in the world is going on in my brain?

Well, in the vernacular, death = renewal/rebirth, so the funeral could
indicate, conversely, a celebration of some kind (it is, in fact, a
"celebration" of someone's life, of their time on earth).  I don't think I'd
worry about it being a portent of someone's upcoming death, unless it because a
recurring dream/theme, or the people in the caskets become recognizable.

For example, before his mom died (before they even knew she was sick), my dad
had a recurring dream of a funeral, and as he approached the casket, his mother
sat straight up.  He's always been prone to precognitive dreams, so when he had
it several times, it started to unnerve him.  When he found out his mother was
ill, it *really* unnerved him.  Come to find out, right before she died, his
mom was comatose, but sat straight up in bed, then laid back down and died.
The funeral home where the service was was identical to the one in his dream.
Creeped him the hell out.

As a result of this type of thing, I spent my entire life not going to a
certain county lake because he had a recurring dream that we were going to
drive off a bridge and one of us would die.  He never told us who, but I have
my suspicions, and I think it was more symbolic than literal that time.

Anyway, ignore my negativity.  :)  I'd think it was a one-time morbid dream,
and unless it happens again, try not to think too hard about it when you go to
sleep tonight.

When I dream I usually have some action/adventure dream, although I've had
totemic type dreams as an adult, too.
Well a few days ago I had this dream of fighting a battle. It was significant
at the time, but has faded now. I just remember being with Mr Kyoti and
preparing for the battle, getting guns and ammo, etc.
Last night started with me not able to see very far, like when you're walking
through the evergreens and the boughs are in front of your face. I sweep some
aside and find myself outside somewhere. Green meadows, trees, lovely area. I
realize that I'm the spirit of autumn. I don't know what makes me realize that,
but it's early autumn. A deer approaches me and I smile, that kind of knowing,
all encompassing smile and I say something to the deer, whisper really, and it
goes off to do what I say. I smile to myself realizing that as the spirit of
autumn they must obey. I see a man and whisper to him. And I'm going along, no
details here, but time is passing. Then I say something to a deer who almost
takes it under advisement and I realize that it's late autumn, almost like my
time has passed and the deer is now going to listen to winter. And I realize
I'm pregnant - see, autumn gives birth to winter, so I'll give birth to the
spirit of winter. And then I realize that I, too, will become winter - that
i'll almost give birth to myself and realize that this will be the way it will
be for season after season, I'll rise up, embody the season, then wane and give
birth to the next season before passing.
And so I am comfortable with this knowledge and walk through the field to a
mansion. I'm at th emansion, then we move to act II
In the mansion I must pass through to the yard, or a courtyard or something,
and again there's fighting. Except this battle the opponents have prepared for
a significant amount of time. We're losing and we're being rounded up.
Apparently I'm helping with the organization and energy behind the rebel
forces, but we're losing, losing ground. The opposition is starting to
celebrate and they have us contained in this courtyard now. I'm a bit frantic,
but thinking my way through - what do we do? They will go off an celebrate, and
there will be fewer guards. How long will that last? etc. The celebrants are
being awarded things, cars, I think. Suddenly this fellow approaches me. He's
Asian and tells me that he was really hoping he'd win, but since we hadn't he
was wondering if we would still be recognized. I blink and look at him and dead
pan to him, "I think this is your recognition" motioning around at us locked
into this area. He doesn't get it and pushes on saying "No, see, my family will
be shamed if I don't come back with honor. Didn't you plan for this? Why
weren't you thinking ahead?" He asks if there's osmething simple, like a
certificate that he can get. And now a couple of other people are staring at
him, trying to figure out how he can be worried about honor or a certificate
when we're herded up like animals and genuinely uncertain what will be our
fate. He's going on about how they planned to give cars as awards, but we get
nothing.
Then I woke up.
Funny thing about dreams, they almost feel less real when you try to explain
them :)

Ever since the advent of Dungeons and Dragons I have always carried the
adventure in my dreams, especially when I became the main storyteller. After
the session is over it is not. In the night I am the leader who cares for his

succeed and take pride in their success.

My dreamed adventures are more detailed, richly textured, more expansive, and

So...I had an odd dream this morning and I'm still puzzling over it. I'll list
the cast of characters first (since that's when it started getting weird) and
then explain the dream.

My dad (70s, healthy, with heart disease but no cause for worry right now)
My uncle (healthy, has severe down syndrome)
Two random elderly gentlemen in wheelchairs (?)
The father of a drummer from my favorite rock band (said drummer is deceased)

Okay, so the story:

It appears that my dad, myself, and Joe (the father of the drummer) were in a
nursing home. The rooms were very large (gathering rooms, basically) with all
white walls. Joe was talking about his son (who passed in December 2009) and
talking about things he liked doing, etc. I imagine this was a program for the
residents of the facility, though from my POV, all I could see was Joe and my
dad.

After Joe's speech, the scene shifted: we were leaving to head for hom. As we
entered another large gathering room, I saw my uncle sitting by a window. He
was in his wheelchair (he's in a nursing home in real life and in a
wheelchair). I went to him and started crying, asking "why did you have to go?
I miss you." Now, he's not sick, no cause for worry that he's going to die
soon, so this puzzled me greatly. In fact, I just saw him on Wednesday and
outside of being grumpy, he was perfectly fine.

As I sat with him at a round table in a white room, I caught a glimpse of
myself in a mirror: I was wearing two hats; a black/grey stretchy knitted
beanie and a purple fedora. I was also digging around in my wallet for change
(presumably to get a can of pop or something) and pulled out a gold dollar
coin. In the dream, this surprised me greatly and made me quite happy.

After sitting with my uncle for a while and taking off the purple fedora, I got
up to leave. I walked through the large room and spotted two random elderly
gentlemen in wheelchairs sitting by an old elevator. This was also white (the
entire hallway was white) and they opened an old steel door to reveal an open
elevator. My dad was on the platform and it moved up quickly, such that he
didn't see me. The men were talking about the elevator, but I don't remember
what they said. Once dad was gone, I turned to leave and that's where things
ended.

So...thoughts? Maybe I shouldn't have potato salad before bed... =)

Hmm. White light and white tunnel? Old guys on the downhill side of life closer
to the end than the beginning? Two hats representing what is and what might be
after they're gone? Elevator going up might be a problem. "C'mon, Dad! Let's
get the show on the road!" ;-{)}

Gold coin at just the right time? As the fortune cookie says, "Good things come

Yeah, I thought about the first part you mentioned there...and hopefully it's
not a sign of things to come. I mean, I do have a very elderly grandmother, but
her health is good and no one else in the family is near to death. I know
people can go without warning, but it didn't feel like that kind of dream.

I do hope the last part is right. I'm trying to get a book published and maybe
that was just a sign that, eventually, it will happen. It might take years, but
it will happen.

Last night I dreamed that my wife and I were somehow responsible for a HS class
trip to Africa.  We were staying at this incredibly wealthy guy's estate.  He
had a pool, not cemented in like ours but more like a swimming hole, and I kept
pulling fossils out of the mud in the bottom.

Later, we were inside trying to watch a DVD, and this guy who I worked with 25+
years ago in a hospital kitchen was there with us, in full chef's whites, being
as annoying as ever, pushing buttons on remotes and then getting angry when we
told him to stop touching things and messing with it.  My wife was with us too,
and she was trying to do damage control and get everything working.

Wacky dream.

Just to contribute something after my 2-month absence...I recently moved in
with a new roommate who has four cats.  I'm very allergic to cats.  I keep my
bedroom and bathroom doors shut all the time so they don't invade my space with
their hair and dander and evilness.  I've been having dreams that I get up to
go to the bathroom, and when I come back to bed, two of them are sleeping on my
pillows and the other two are on the window sill above them, staring at me with
absolute distaste for the human who won't pet them.

I know it's the general anxiety of living with animals that make me break out
in hives, but I always find the dream slightly amusing, because I imagine them
trying to figure out how to get in when I'm not here so they can roll around on
my bed and bedding with wild cat abandon.

I have a recurring dream that I'm in an airport and get hassled by airline
staff about my passport.  The plane loses power and has to make an emergency

The outcome is not good I guess because I wake up before it crashes.  I've had

I also have lucid dreams a few times a month but they don't involve the plane
crash scenario.

I dreamed I was in a hotel and had fallen asleep in a chair.  I "woke up" in
the dream and realized I was dreaming and had all 5 senses, clarity and control
over everything.

I decided to look at myself in the mirror and saw my face gradually change into
someone elses.

In another lucid dream I was in a desert or sandy parking lot in bright
sunlight.  I took a deep breath and looked at my wristwatch..the watch was
ticking exactly like a normal watch would.

What scares me about lucid dreams is that I might get stuck in the dream and
pass away because I'm in the dream too long or maybe my body might be
traumatized by all the confusion. heh.

I guess Xanax and Zyrtec can do that to you too as well as going to sleep after
eating, which I usually do.

I had a dream the other night that I was at some fancy affair in a fancy dress.
I ran into my ex-bf (first bf from HS) who I'm still on friendly terms with. 
He took me out to the parking lot, pushed me up against a car, and said
something about making up for lost time.  He pushed up my dress and was going
for his belt.  I stopped him, since we're both married with a kid.

It's weird because I haven't really talked to him in a long time.  We didn't
have sex when we dated, thus the "making up for lost time" comment in the
dream.  I'm not really attracted to him anymore and have never had a dream
about him like that.

I'm female and often have dreams similar to the other anon. I may know the
person or may not, no pattern there, and it's not an attractive type of a
dream. It's always that I'm with the person in some setting and they start
coming on to me. I always resist, different lines of thinking or narratives
evolve but the dream always ends when I finally stop all the advances. I don't
know what they are, possibly anxiety dreams? I'm very happily married and would
never cheat on my husband. Sometimes I can feel guilty even having a great
conversation with a guy I suspect finds me interesting or attractive. I used to

No reason to feel guilty for having a *conversation* with another guy.  If your
spouse can't handle that, he has problems :)

I think people who get really jealous about their spouses need to check
themselves.  Either you trust your partner and your relationship is on solid
ground or you don't and you need to deal with that.

Maybe I'm naive (It's been said before :) but it's the way I feel.

Wow - lately have been having really long dreams, and they all seem to be in
chapters. I mean lately as in the past week. No idea where this is coming from
and by morning I can only taste parts of the dreams. If I tried to explain them
they wouldn't make sense, but I can still see littleflashes of things. Last
night was interesting. I was following somebody somewhere. DOwn long hallways
of heavy doors, lots of doors in different places, through outdoor avenues, but
also with doors. And then at one point the person decides to go down what looks
like a hatch in a submarine or a skylight (we're on top or in a building).
There's a ladder leading down and light coming out and inside the hatch there's
white circular tubing wrapped around or insulation that you have to squeeze
through.
Anyways, doors. No idea why. And episodic dreams as though in chapters. Hrm.

Call me Dead.
I dream. A lot. And I have very detailed and complicated dreams. I remember all
kinds of things from them from colors and smells and things people said to how
things felt. Occasionally I'll dream about somebody I know or somebody that
passed away. My dear grandmother passed a few years ago and every so often I'll
dream of her. None of my siblings have ever had a dream of her and they were
equally, if not more, close to her.
The last four nights I've had dreams of people passed, last night being the
oddest. The first night was of my great grandmother. It was a very brief
appearance, but it was her. Never dreamed of her before, and she passed in 1992
or so. The second night was of a grandfather. I wasn't particularly close to
him, but there were odd messages or insights (I think that's a better term)
that were being passed to me. He wanted somebody to tell me the four things
that he was afraid of or bothered him or that he was watching for. Something
along the emotions of being uncertain and wary. New Year's Eve/New Year's
morning I dreamed of my dear grandmother who passed about 4 years ago. That was
far more rich and detailed.
In the grandmother dream, I found out she wasn't dead, but rather was existing
in this other place. I can't say she was living, as she was kind of stuck
there. I walked down an alley that used to be near her house, and there was a
ramshackle 3 story building on the left. That building was never there, but
only int he dream. I'm abhorred she is in such a place. It looks awful. When I
step inside, it's actually remarkably clean, tidy and warm feeling. It's just
on the outside it looks ghetto. She's up on the third floor. A staircase
reaches to the third floor but doesn't connect across to her apartment. People
are downstairs - my mother and family. They don't know she's able to ba
accessed. They are down there, talking, mourning(?), and conversing. They seem
to be talking about her. I climb the stairs and am near her apartment and can't
get over. I know she's just inside this almost loft-like area. And I can tell
it's lovely inside with many of the things I lvoed about her house - a feeling
of coziness, warmth, contentedness, etc. She appears in the opening (not really
a doorway as I don't recall a door, but an opening), and sees I'm there.
Pleasantly surprised! She comes out onto this balcony-like area and starts to
push a ladder like thing across to connect to the stairs and allow me over. I'm
crying, so happy to see her, and feeling so awful that I haven't realized she
was there all along. Again, not that she was alive all along, but that she was
there all along. She's smiling and reassuring and letting me know that of
course she's been there. I never make it across the ladder-like thing, but we
had a lovely conversation.
I woke up feeling so touched. I don't believe in supernatural or religion or
talking with the dead, but rather that this was a lovely rememberance out of my
memory and emotions about her. But so odd to have such a long and involved
dream. Usually dreams I have about a dead relative or person are short and just
impressions.
Then last night's dream was completely different. Skipping all the unrelated
parts, it comes to me and a childhood friend that are having to get some work
done and we're waiting in line for lunch talking about the work. The line isn't
moving, it's awful and uncoordinated and just going on forever. We're torn
between leaving the line to get work done and getting food so we can work
better/think clearly. The shop eventually closes down never serving anyone and
we end up with a bag of groceryies in a way and two cupcakes. And then we head
back to the car. But we stumble across this young man. We don't know him, but
he's up to no good. Somehow we realize he's a cannibal and evil and about to be
very bad - do some bad act. He poses as a much younger child, and he looks
youthful, so others underestimate his potential to do harm. I decide to follow
him and manage to get him corralled in a house. There's a mother and two kids,
and now I'm concerned the boy/man is a sexual predator. I tell the mother to
keep an eye on him, and she starts interacting with him like he's a normal kid,
like he's over for a play date. I try to emphasize that he's evil, that he has
a couple of friends on the way who are going to help him, that he's posing as
harmless and younger than he is. I'm getting frantic because I need her to
realize the seriousness and what she needs to do, and I need to get authorities
and others, security, to join in. I start using his name - Adam Lanza.
Eventually I can get the point across, which angers him and he starts to "grow
older". We're int he driveway and now I can relax as everyone really does
realize what he is.
This is usch an odd dream for me as, as hearltess as this sounds, I can't say I
care that much about Sandy Hook. Yes, it was a tragedy. Yes, I feel awful for
those families. But it isn't a personal event from any angle and doesn't
emotionally hit me like that. I suppose my brain just grabbed a name and
attached it. However I haven't read a lot of articles about the whole thing. It
wasn't until about a half-hour after I woke up that I connected the name I used
in my dream with the Sandy Hook murderer.

Anyways, a series of odd dreams striking in a few ways. I always find to share
these is more useful and often clears them out of my head. SO I send them out
into the vast silence here. Curious what others might make of them.

Dear ISCA Users,

One of my best friends is currently fighting for his life.

https://www.facebook.com/pages/Apoya-a-Riclucx-Ricardo-Resendiz/213298135424089

I haven't been able to contact his family since Wednesday, last I heard they
got some weird antibiotic from Texas all the way down to Mexico City, but it
seems it just ain't working fast enough. His friends & family are now asking
donations; info on this is on the FB page I just posted in both English and
Spanish.

I really, really hope he'llget better.

Due to a coronal mass ejection from the sun on Thursday, there is a possibility
of seeing the "Northern Lights" tonight after sunset in U.S. states bordering
on Canada (of course they can be seen all the time in Alaska).  So, keep your
eyes on the skies tonight, particularly if it is sunny today where you are.

Murrah building. The blast occuted at 9:02AM at what would have been the
busiest time in the morning. The blast claimed 168 lives, 19 of which would be
under 19.
The prime accomplice, Timothy McVeigh, used what amount to be fertiliziser
demoted in the back of a rental truck.McVeigh set the bomb to go off at 9:02,
and then tried to escape using high speeds along I-35. In fact, the police did

Timothy VcVeigh was killed by lethal injection in June 2001 for the 8 federal

On July 13, 2012 my wife (TUFKA Woolfenden) and I learned that her two little
cousins had gone missing. These girls were last seen at 12:15 PM. Searches have
found no clues of where they could have gone. Because there is no evidence that
these girls were abducted there will be no Amber Alert to help spread the news.
We are relying upon word of mouth to get their information in front of every
single person possible. We finally have the support of media to get the story
told and to have their picture circulated. However, the more people that know
about this the more likely we are to find the girls and bring them home.

Please visit tinyurl.com/MissingCousins for the facebook page I have put
together with their information. Elizabeth Collins and Lyric Cook are relying
on us to find them and bring them home.

Please pass this along to everyone you know no matter if they are online or RL
contact, we are desperately needing the coverage to rescure these sweet angels.

so we (the family) are continuing to push for exposure. Our hopes is to find
that one person that knows that one clue so we can find them.

To make it easier to share, we have created www.cousinsunited.com

There is also a QR code embeded on our newest flyers to hand out and to make it

Subject: Live Long and Prosper

Hello All!

I'm sure some of you remember me, Bill Carlson:
http://wkks.org/bill

I have a major medical announcement to make. About August 2nd, I was diagnosed
with a brain tumor. I am scheduled to have a major neuro surgery at my good old
employer, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. I'll be there in a late
in August for the Real thing.

Now, this is obviously a big concern for us non-medical experts. Brain surgery
is risky, actual results can vary quite a bit. Risk of death, definitely there.

My mind says: Oh well. Decide. I have. I choose I want to live, so will move on
to get my desired results.

Now, to date my life has been interesting and gone up and down and back up. I
have a wife and family that I adore. I have achieved the things I wanted and
had a good time. I'm not worried if it is time for me to go.

I appreciate knowing you all. Contact me if you need to know something.

Later!


--
Bill Carlson

Anything is possible, given Time and Money.




Aka, me, Kael

Producer Tony Scott dead of suicide.

Tony Scott, director of such Hollywood blockbusters as "Top Gun," ''Days of
Thunder" and "Beverly Hills Cop II," died Sunday after jumping from a Los
Angeles County Bridge, authorities said.

Scott had inoperable brain cancer.

Tony Scott's older brother was Ridley Scott, and the two worked together often
in their own production company: "Scott Free." Their TV hit the Good Wife is
still going strong.

Today is the beginning of the 38th Nqtional Suicide Prevention Week.
http://www.suicidology.org/about-aas/nspw
Tomorrow will be World Suicide prevention day http://www.iasp.info/wspd/

Yesterday I walked "Out of the Darkeness" walk supported by the AFSP
American Foundation for the Prevention of Suicide, to fund projects that
increase awareness of this public health phenomenon and put the message of HOPE
and prevention out there.
http://afsp.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.home

The national suicide prevention LIFEline is 1-800-273-talk (8255)

Suicide warning signs, like someone talking about suicide, are fairly well
known, though it bears repeating that anyone talking about suicide should be
taken VERY seriously.  Here are some of the PROTECTIVE features, the ways that
if someone is connected, they are less likely to committ suicide.

"Protective Factors for Suicide"
o Effective clinical care for mental, physical and substance use disorders
o Easy access to a variety of clinical interventions and support for help-
seeking
* Restricted access to highly lethal means of suicide (guns)
* Strong connections to family and community support
* Support through ongoing medical and mental health care relationships
* Skills in problem solving, conflict resolution and nonviolent handling of
disputes
* Cultural and religious beliefs that discourage suicide and support self-
preservation

According to my therapist, "Protective Factors for Suicide" also includes:
* Having a pet
* Having a forward-looking attitude
* Future things to look forward to
* Engaged in activities/groups/hobbies
* Having a job
* Believing things can get better
* (And just about Anything that promotes self-esteem!)

Depression and the other diseases of the mind that can contribute to suicide
are real illnesses. Not weaknesses. Not character flaws. People battling these
illnesses deserve the understanding and treatment afforded people with any
other illness." said Robert Gebbia, AFSP executive director."

From age 6 to 38 I've lived with suicidal thoughts as part of my illness.
This is the first time in my life I have decide I will never again let suicide
be my answer. I won't consider it. And I have been able to say that for only a
few months. But it means the world to my husband. I will not leave "survivors"

Today is National Coming Out Day.  for those of you who have friends and loved
ones (as most of us likely do, now) who are LGBT, and who are out, remember to
recognize and honor that courage.  For those who have them who are out to you,
recognize the trust that means.  For those who have them who are coming out
today... stand beside them, because they will need a hand to hold, a shoulder
to brace them.  And for those who aren't out, who may be reading this - the
time will come when you can be, safely and securely.  It may not be today, or
tomorrow.  But it will be here, and there will be people to stand with you, gay
and straight alike, with that shoulder, and with that hand.
Here's mine.

A difficult man -- His personality previously was like Dr. Gregory House --
only the puzzle interested him, and damned if he cared about how he made others
feel.  Eventually embraced family and even geneaolgy, became a FB regular to
talk to his new-found relatives. Of course, he was my dad, so it is affecting

Now my mother and father are both gone, Fortunately I have my spouse to help me

On a related note to my last posting --

1) BE INSURED  it is never too soon to get basic life or burial insurance -- if
you smoke, quit first for a year. Social security's death benefit is pathetic.
Not even $500 in many cases.

2) ADEQUATELY INSURE: Above all else, Dont leave your family with a massive
bill to carry out your last wishes. Cremation can cost up to 1K, there are fees
from the mortuary for transporting the body from the hospital, and other
things. Dying ain't cheap for those left behind. Add to that a service,
"viewing" and so on, it can get VERY expensive more like 5-10 K. You don't want
your survivors to be paying that out of pocket.

3) BANK ACCOUNTS It's mever a bad idea to add to your banking accounts "TOD"
status: Transfer on Death to _____ (persons name)  Speak to your bank --
especially if you have debts and assets that will need an executor, This TOD
bank acciount can help them get things done before money is released to them
from insurance and etc.

4) MAKE A WILL. If you have a child, or you are the age of 20 or greater, there
is no reason you shouldn't have a will. Don't postpone. Have one and notorize
it and you can then just update it as needed.

5) ORGAN DONOR? Make sure even if your license says organ donor, that your
family/next of kin/doctor all know this is what you want. Hospitals will not
donate your organs if your family doesn't want it done. Make sure they know
your wishes so it isn't something they have to figure out at a difficult time.,

6) LIVE SMART! Live well, get healthier, go for yearly screenings, and all
additional screenings based on age -- screenings that can save your life.
Make smart decisions about things like wearing seatbelts, not texting while
driving, or riding a motorcycle when the weather is inclement. Don't smoke.

[Don't die too young.]
Death sucks.
Sucks more if you didn't prepare these things.

My mom died of lung cancer with debts, not many assets, and her insurance was a
month from maturing into the level that would pay for her funeral. No will.
My siblings and extended family scrabbled together money to pay for her
service, down to bakesales and you name it beceuse there was no money.
My dad died of a heart attack, with no debts, no assets, no insurance. no will.
He did not want a service, just cremation, so we only had to scrabble for $1K

If I could see them one more time, Id first hug them, then I'd bitchslap them.

Less than 4 months, actually. They're guessing 8-9 weeks. The announcement only
came because she's in hospital with acute morning sickness, otherwise they
would've waited a few weeks more.

Hyperemesis Gravidarum is actually what she's got, its a MILLION times worse
than morning sickness.

"As with any kind of extreme gastrointestinal illness, vomiting to the point
that it leads to extreme dehydration can be quite dangerous. Left untreated,
hyperemesis gravidarum can result in premature birth or low birth weight, and
extreme continual vomiting can tear the esophagus. If electrolytes become
unbalanced, the result can be dizziness and eventually, heart damage."
