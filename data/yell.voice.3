Users may now be age validated by submitting their date of birth via <y>ell.
Any users over 18 years of age in our system are able to access age restricted
fora.  Currently this includes only Kama Sutra>.

You may <y>ell your date of birth if you would like to be age validated.  By
yelling, you are certifying that you are submitting true and accurate
information.

The Sysops will acknowledge your yell once they have input your DOB.  You will
be able to check it by hitting shift-<P> and profiling yourself, and you will
be able to <j>ump to Kama Sutra> - you must enter the full room name on the
first occasion.

In the future, we intend to allow each user to enter his or her own DOB.
